# article_list = [{'title': 'Into the Breach: Breaking Down 3 SaaS App Cyber Attacks in 2022',
#   'text': 'During the last week of March, three major tech companies - Microsoft, Okta, and HubSpot - reported significant data breaches. DEV-0537, also known as LAPSUS$, performed the first two. This highly sophisticated group utilizes state-of-the-art attack vectors to great success. Meanwhile, the group behind the HubSpot breach was not disclosed. This blog will review the three breaches based on publicly disclosed information and suggest best practices to minimize the risk of such attacks succeeding against your organization.\n\nHubSpot - Employee Access\n\nOn March 21, 2022, HubSpot reported the breach which happened on March 18. Malicious actors compromised a HubSpot employee account that the employee used for customer support. This allowed malicious actors the ability to access and export contact data using the employee\'s access to several HubSpot accounts.\n\nWith little information regarding this breach, defending against an attack is challenging, but a key configuration within HubSpot can help. This is the "HubSpot Employee Access" control (shown in the figure below) in HubSpot\'s account setting. Customers should disable this setting at all times, unless they require specific assistance, and then immediately turn it off after completing the service call.\n\nA similar setting appears in other SaaS applications and should be disabled there as well. Employee access is typically recorded in Audit Logs, which should be reviewed regularly.\n\nLearn how an SSPM can help protect your organization from SaaS misconfigurations\n\nOkta - Lack of Device Security for Privileged User\n\nOkta subcontracts some of its customer support to the Sitel Group. On January 21, an Okta security team member received an alert that a new MFA factor was added to a Sitel Group employee account from a new location.\n\nAn investigation revealed that a Sitel support engineer\'s computer was compromised using a remote desktop protocol. This known vulnerability is normally disabled except when specifically needed — which helped Okta investigators narrow the timeframe for the attack to a five-day window between Jan. 16-21, 2022.\n\nDue to the limited access support engineers have to their system, the impact on Okta customers was minimal. Support engineers don\'t have access to create or delete users or download customer databases. Their access to customer data is quite limited as well.\n\nOn March 22, DEV-0537, which is more commonly known as LAPSUS$, shared screenshots online. In response, Okta released a statement saying, "there are no corrective actions our customers need to take." The following day the company shared details of its investigation, which included a detailed response timeline.\n\nWhile this breach was limited in the damage it caused, it offers three important security lessons.\n\nSecurity from Device to SaaS – securing a SaaS environment isn\'t enough when it comes to protecting against a breach. Securing the devices used by highly privileged users is of paramount importance. Organizations should review their roster of high-privilege users and ensure that their devices are secure. This can limit the damage of a breach via the attack vector that faced Okta. MFA – It was the addition of MFA that allowed Okta security to discover the breach. SSO does not go far enough, and organizations that take SaaS security seriously must also include MFA security measures. Event monitoring – The Okta breach was discovered when security personnel saw an unexpected change in the event monitoring log. Reviewing events such as changes to MFA, password reset, suspicious logins, and more, are critical for SaaS security and should be performed daily.\n\nSee Cloudflare\'s investigation of the January 2022 Okta compromise for a good example of a response to such a breach.\n\nFind out how Adaptive Shield provides endpoint posture management and SaaS configuration control\n\nMicrosoft - MFA for all privileged users\n\nOn March 22, Microsoft Security shared information relating to an attack it suffered at the hands of DEV-0537. Microsoft had a single account compromised, which resulted in source code being stolen and published.\n\nMicrosoft assured its users that the LAPSUS$ attack didn\'t compromise any of their information, and further stated that there was no risk to any of their products due to the stolen code.\n\nMicrosoft did not specifically share how the breach was carried out, although it did alert readers that LAPSUS$ actively recruits employees at telecoms, major software developers, call centers, and other industries to share credentials.\n\nThe company also offered these suggestions for securing platforms against these attacks.\n\nStrengthen MFA implementation - MFA gaps are a key attack vector. Organizations should require MFA options, limiting SMS and email as much as possible, such as with Authenticator or FIDO tokens. Require healthy and trusted endpoints - Organizations should continuously assess device security. Ensure that the devices accessing SaaS platforms comply with their security policies by enforcing secure device configurations with a low vulnerability risk score. Leverage modern authentication options for VPNs - VPN authentication should leverage modern authentication options such as OAuth or SAML. Strengthen and monitor your cloud security posture - Organizations should, at minimum, set conditional access for users and session risk configurations, require MFA, and block high risk logins.\n\nFor a full list of Microsoft\'s recommendations, see this note.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nSecuring SaaS platforms is a major challenge, and as seen this week, even global enterprises need to stay on top of their security. Malicious actors continue to evolve and improve their attack methods, which forces organizations to be on the lookout and prioritize their SaaS security constantly.\n\nStrong passwords and SSO solutions are no longer enough by themselves. Companies need advanced security measures, such as strong MFA, IP allow lists, and blocking unnecessary support engineer access. An automated solution like SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) can help security teams stay on top of these issues.\n\nThe importance of device security in SaaS is another takeaway from these attacks. Even a fully secured SaaS platform can be compromised when a privileged user accesses a SaaS app from a compromised device. Leverage a security solution that combines device security posture with SaaS security posture for full, end-to-end protection.\n\nThe challenge of securing SaaS solutions is complex and beyond burdensome to complete manually. SSPM solutions, like Adaptive Shield, can provide automated SaaS security posture management, with configuration control, endpoint posture management, and 3rd party application control.\n\nNote — This article is written and contributed by Hananel Livneh, Senior Product Analyst at Adaptive Shield.',

#  {'title': 'Disrupting cyberattacks targeting Ukraine',
#   'text': 'Today, we’re sharing more about cyberattacks we’ve seen from a Russian nation-state actor targeting Ukraine and steps we’ve taken to disrupt it.\n\nWe recently observed attacks targeting Ukrainian entities from Strontium, a Russian GRU-connected actor we have tracked for years. This week, we were able to disrupt some of Strontium’s attacks on targets in Ukraine. On Wednesday April 6th, we obtained a court order authorizing us to take control of seven internet domains Strontium was using to conduct these attacks. We have since re-directed these domains to a sinkhole controlled by Microsoft, enabling us to mitigate Strontium’s current use of these domains and enable victim notifications.\n\nStrontium was using this infrastructure to target Ukrainian institutions including media organizations. It was also targeting government institutions and think tanks in the United States and the European Union involved in foreign policy. We believe Strontium was attempting to establish long-term access to the systems of its targets, provide tactical support for the physical invasion and exfiltrate sensitive information. We have notified Ukraine’s government about the activity we detected and the action we’ve taken.\n\nThis disruption is part of an ongoing long-term investment, started in 2016, to take legal and technical action to seize infrastructure being used by Strontium. We have established a legal process that enables us to obtain rapid court decisions for this work. Prior to this week, we had taken action through this process 15 times to seize control of more than 100 Strontium controlled domains.\n\nThe Strontium attacks are just a small part of the activity we have seen in Ukraine. Before the Russian invasion, our teams began working around the clock to help organizations in Ukraine, including government agencies, defend against an onslaught of cyberwarfare that has escalated since the invasion began and has continued relentlessly. Since then, we have observed nearly all of Russia’s nation-state actors engaged in the ongoing full-scale offensive against Ukraine’s government and critical infrastructure, and we continue to work closely with government and organizations of all kinds in Ukraine to help them defend against this onslaught. In the coming weeks we expect to provide a more comprehensive look at the scope of the cyberwar in Ukraine.\n\nTags: cyberattacks, cybersecurity, cyberwar, Russia, strontium, Ukraine',

#  {'title': 'Electronic espionage agency getting major funding boost to ward off cyber attacks',
#   'text': 'Canada\'s electronic espionage agency is getting a huge chunk of change — nearly a billion dollars over the next few years — to confront the growing threat of cyber attacks by private actors and foreign states.\n\nThe federal budget, tabled Thursday in the House of Commons, promises to give the Communications Security Establishment $875.2 million over five years, starting in the 2022/2023 fiscal year, and then $238.2 million annually "to address the rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape."\n\n"As Canadians grow more dependent on digital systems, the potential consequences of cyber incidents continue to increase, and Canada needs to be ready," says the budget document.\n\nThe budget includes money to enhance the agency\'s abilities to launch cyber operations to prevent and defend against cyber attacks — $263.9 million over five years starting in 2022-23, and then $96.5 million annually thereafter.\n\nCSE has both active powers — to disrupt foreign online threats to Canada\'s systems — and defensive powers that allow it to take action online to protect Canadian systems.\n\nUsing its active powers, CSE could (for example) prevent a terrorist group from communicating about a planned attack by disabling their communication devices.\n\nThe budget also sets aside more than $180.3 million to boost CSE\'s ability to prevent and respond to cyber attacks on critical infrastructure, such as hydro plants and provincial health authorities.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador experienced the real-life effects of cyberwarfare last year when a cyberattack threw its health care system into temporary chaos, forcing the cancellation of thousands of procedures ranging from surgeries to chemotherapy to X-rays.\n\nThe federal budget, tabled Thursday in the House of Commons, promises to give the Communications Security Establishment $875.2 million over five years. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nCSE has issued multiple warnings this year to power companies, banks and other critical players in Canada\'s economy, urging them to shore up their defences against Russia-based cyberwarfare activity as the Western world responds to Moscow\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe budget also includes $252.3 million to allow CSE to make critical government systems more resilient to cyberattacks, and $178.7 million over five years — starting in 2022-23 — to expand cybersecurity protection for small departments, agencies and Crown corporations.\n\nEarlier this year, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians identified potential points of vulnerability in the government\'s cyber defences. It said Crown corporations and organizations such as airport authorities are known targets for state actors — but they don\'t fall under the Treasury Board\'s cyber-related directives or policies and need better protection.\n\nA large portion of the new money heading to CSE will go to increasing its staffing complement and tackling the agency\'s IT needs.\n\nSeparately, the government is also spending just over $17.7 million over five years to permit CSE to set up up a research chair program to fund academics\' research on technologies relevant to its mandate.\n\n"This expertise can be leveraged to ensure Canada\'s security and intelligence community stays one step ahead of our adversaries," reads the budget document — which didn\'t say what types of technologies CSE is seeking.\n\nAfter years of warnings from Canada\'s intelligence and security agencies about vulnerabilities in Canada\'s research sectors, the budget also pledges millions of dollars to to protect federally funded research.\n\nThat includes $125 million over five years, starting in 2022-23, and $25 million annually thereafter to build capacity within post-secondary institutions "to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks to research security," says the budget document.\n\n"Canadian research and intellectual property can be an attractive target for foreign intelligence agencies looking to advance their own economic, military, or strategic interests," reads the document.\n\nCanadian Security Intelligence Service director David Vigneault has been warning governments for years now about the risk foreign interference — notably from China and Russia — poses to Canada\'s security and economy.\n\nLast year, Vigneault said his domestic intelligence agency has seen "espionage and foreign interference activity at levels not seen since the Cold War."',

#  {'title': 'Report: Increase in socially engineered, sophisticated cybersecurity attacks plagues organizations',
#   'text': 'A new cybersecurity report from San Francisco-based Abnormal Security found that medical industries and insurance companies had a 45-60% chance of being the target of a phone fraud attack via email: a sophisticated scam where the scammer sends an email to the target, asking the target to call them. In the second half of 2021, those attacks increased by 10 percent.\n\nAdditionally, healthcare systems are seeing a rise in more legitimate-looking yet problematic business email compromise (BEC) attacks. This occurs when the scammer accesses the target’s business email and impersonates the target, and then uses that identity to create rapport with victims and get them to pay money.\n\n“In the second half of 2021, email attacks increased by 10 percent. Healthcare systems are also seeing a rise in more legitimate-looking yet problematic business compromise emails, which can cost victims as much as $2.4 billion,” said Crane Hassold, former FBI analyst and director of threat intelligence at Abnormal Security in an email forwarded from a representative. “Our report saw medical industries had a 68.9% chance of receiving a business email compromise attack each week.”\n\nThe report quantified how many different kind of attacks occur, and the numbers are not only big, but growing. For example, the chance of a large business experiencing a phone fraud attack: 72%. And that’s their weekly risk.\n\n\n\nSupply chain attacks, an emerging threat type, were also up: there was a 67% chance of experiencing such an attack in the second half of 2021, according to the report. In such instances, the attackers phish in hopes of penetrating the target’s email. The attacker then leverages the target’s email and contact base to send phony invoices to clients, which can be particularly difficult to detect, the report said.\n\nAdditionally, voice phishing – vishing – has increased, the report noted. Such attacks typically begin with an email requiring the user to call, or else face some threat, such as a pending charge. For example, the report found scammers imitated companies ranging from Amazon to PayPal to Microsoft to Best Buy. The rate of such scams increased over 2021, according to the report.\n\nAnd the risks went all the way to the C-suite. The report found a 23.9% increase in executive targeting from June through December of 2021.\n\n“A major takeaway from Abnormal Security’s H2 Threat Report is that cyber criminals are turning from low-value attacks to more sophisticated, high-value strategies that use social engineering to trick recipients into sending money or leaking sensitive information. These threats don’t appear malicious making it easy for them to slip past secure email gateways and land in employee inboxes where they can cause significant damage,” Hassold said in an email provided by a representative.\n\nHistorically attacks included a link in the email the scammers would hope the target would click on after opening the email. Software protecting against cyber attacks often looks for as much. However, this year the report found that scammers moved away from such links, turning to more sophisticated tactics. Instead the emails often do not have a link, but instead prompt the target to call a number, thus evading some tradition protection measures. In some cases there is no email and the scammer calls the target directly.\n\n“Cyber attacks are easily the #1 threat to organizations today–ransomware attacks, business email compromise and social engineering attacks are all financially impactful. Healthcare leaders need to be aware of the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape,” Hassold added.\n\nHassold added, “Moving forward, it’s important for healthcare organizations not to overthink cybersecurity. They need to have defenses in place to prevent initial access to their corporate network and invest in robust email security solutions like Abnormal Security that detect a wide range of email attacks and definitively safeguard employees’ inboxes.”\n\nPhoto: HYWARDS, Getty Images',

#  {'title': 'Government is learning how to work with private sector on cyber threats',
#   'text': "Here are two examples of the government and private companies partnering on cybersecurity The FBI has partially thwarted a notorious group of Russian hackers, even as officials remain on high alert for Russian cyberattacks against critical U.S. industries. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Agents worked with the private sector throughout a months-long operation against the Russian military intelligence unit known as Sandworm. That included a Pennsylvania company to analyze an infected system that helped them find a list of devices that the system was communicating with. The FBI also “worked closely” with WatchGuard, which made some of the devices and issued a software update in February, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said.\n\nYet some devices are still vulnerable to hacks. “Devices that acted as bots may remain vulnerable to Sandworm if device owners do not take … recommended detection and remediation steps,” the Justice Department “Devices that acted as bots may remain vulnerable to Sandworm if device owners do not take … recommended detection and remediation steps,” the Justice Department warned\n\nThe number of previously infected devices decreased by just 39 percent from the time the update was issued to March 18, an agent wrote in a court filing. “Many victims likely lack the technical ability to independently remediate their devices, or do not regularly monitor industry reporting that would contain articles” about the malware, they wrote.\n\nThe FBI also worked with foreign law enforcement agencies, giving them information about overseas devices that were infected by the group, a Justice Department official told The Cybersecurity 202.\n\nThe Justice Department’s operation to disrupt the botnet took place at the end of March, it said. It said it carried out the operation before any disruptive attacks using the botnet took place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat timing is key given the threat Sandworm poses amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe group is “one of the actors we have been most concerned about in light of the invasion,” Mandiant vice president of intelligence analysis John Hultquist said. “We are concerned that they could be used to hit targets in Ukraine, but we are also concerned they may hit targets in the West in retribution for the pressure being placed on Russia.”\n\nThe U.S. government has accused Sandworm of being responsible for some massive hacks, like NotPetya, which crippled computer systems in Ukraine and other countries in 2017.\n\nHigh alert\n\nEnergy companies and the U.S. government are on high alert, with President Biden’s warning last month of “evolving intelligence” that Russia is exploring possible cyberattacks against American critical industries, Ellen Nakashima reports.\n\nIndustry executives worked with U.S. government officials to “draw up a playbook and help prepare the electricity sector to deal with potential cyberattacks by Russia,” Ellen writes. The guidelines stressed the importance of quickly sharing information about cyberattacks between the industry and government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The collaboration between government and the private sector has seen exponential improvement over the last couple of years,” said Bill Fehrman , president and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE), which provides electricity generated by wind, solar, natural gas and coal to 12 million customers in the United States, Canada and Britain.\n\n“The main benefit,” he said, “is the more efficient transfer of information from the front line — the companies — to the government, and getting usable information back from the government in a timely manner.”\n\nU.S. officials say they’re more prepared for a cyberattack than before. But “Russian malicious cyber actors have posed a high threat to the U.S. government and the critical infrastructure since before the invasion of Ukraine, and they will present a threat after this current crisis is resolved,” CISA Executive Director Brandon Wales said.\n\nOn the Hill\n\nCongress is watching. At a Wednesday hearing on Capitol Hill, lawmakers pressed two top Biden administration cybersecurity officials on how information sharing and collaboration is actually working amid the administration’s warnings about potential Russian cyberattacks.\n\n“We have no way of knowing if these operators are hearing those warnings and taking action to shore up their defenses,” said Rep. Yvette D. Clarke (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee’s cybersecurity subcommittee. “From where I’m sitting, one thing is clear: The United States desperately needs to revamp the playbook it uses for critical infrastructure cybersecurity.”\n\nLawmakers also homed in on the path forward for CISA, given that it's moving toward newly enacted requirements that critical organizations report hacks to the federal government.\n\nRep. Andrew R. Garbarino (N.Y.), the top Republican on the panel, asked CISA Executive Assistant Director Eric Goldstein if Congress should be concerned that the agency’s relationship with industry could change “if CISA takes more of a regulator role.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“CISA’s role in the current space as a trusted partner in cybersecurity, where our goal is solely to catalyze improved cybersecurity as a voluntary partner, is one that's invaluable, and that's a relationship that we work very hard to preserve and advance with partners across sectors,” Goldstein said.\n\nThe keys\n\nFacebook takes down covert influence campaigns aimed at Ukraine\n\nThe social media company said in a new report that it discovered efforts to falsely report Ukrainian reports as breaking the site’s rules and a campaign by the Ghostwriter group to hack members of Ukraine’s military, Naomi Nix reports. Ghostwriter has posted disinformation from infected accounts as if it’s coming from an authentic person.\n\n“We continue to see operations from Belarus and Russia-linked actors target platforms across the Internet,” Facebook head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher told reporters. “We know that determined adversaries like this will keep trying to come back.”\n\nNATO officials warn of Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine\n\nRussia’s cyberattacks before it invaded Ukraine were “unprecedented,” as “Russian cyber-units successfully deployed more destructive malware … than the rest of the world’s cyberpowers combined typically use in a given year,” NATO Assistant Secretary General David Cattler and principal analyst Daniel Black wrote in Foreign Affairs. Russia is also “deploying additional destructive malware on a weekly basis,” they wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia could launch more devastating cyberattacks, they warned. “With the likelihood that the conflict will become a protracted war, Russia will probably not exercise restraint in its use of additional disruptive and destructive cyber-actions,” they wrote. “Russian President Vladimir Putin is most likely to double down on early cyber-successes and seek to further disrupt and undermine government, military, and civilian infrastructure, as well as defense industrial base enterprises. ”\n\nGoogle removed dozens of data-harvesting apps from its app store\n\nResearchers say the apps were installed on millions of Android devices, the Wall Street Journal’s Byron Tau and Robert McMillan report. They contained computer code from a Panamanian company that harvested location data and personally identifiable information. The code also had the ability to scan — but not necessarily view the contents of — users’ WhatsApp downloads folders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers shared their findings with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Google, which said it removed the apps as of March 25. The apps can be relisted if they remove the code that collects the data, Google spokesman Scott Westover told the Journal. Some of the apps are already back on the app store.\n\nThe FTC declined to comment to the Journal on whether it was investigating because its investigations are not public. Measurement Systems, the Panamanian company, told the outlet that “the allegations you make about the company’s activities are false.”\n\nIndustry report\n\nMandiant and CrowdStrike vow to collaborate\n\nThe agreement between the two companies extends a trend of cooperation among companies and the government as they work to battle cyberattacks, Joseph Menn reports. Mandiant, which is best known for leading investigations of breaches, will begin deploying protection tools from CrowdStrike as it advises customers and responds to breaches, executives told The Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Google agreed to acquire Mandiant for $5.4 billion.

#   'text': 'Businesses are on high alert following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. As the conflict began, many experts predicted Russia would unleash a significant cyber attack on Western businesses. Others warned organisations they could become collateral damage in a devastating Russian cyber assault similar to the infamous 2017 NotPetya attack. Russian activity, so far, has been limited to minor distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, but that’s not to say bigger and targeted cyber assaults won’t take place. In March, US President Joe Biden warned businesses in critical sectors to be on alert amid the growing Russian cyber threat. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) also recently warned that wiper malware, known as HermeticWiper, was in use against Ukrainian organisations. This, too, has the potential to impact firms outside the country. A report from Forrester, meanwhile, says every organisation must prepare for a “new era of cyber threats” as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, CISOs from every industry must prepare for increased cyber attacks and cyber espionage, according to the analyst house. So what is the real cyber security threat to UK organisations from Russia, and how can businesses prepare amid an uncertain economic and cyber security landscape? Threats to the West Russian cyber attacks on the West are nothing new, and the country has been active in the cyber landscape for many years. Incidents attributed to Russian state-sponsored adversaries include attacks targeting the electrical sector in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016, the NotPetya incident in 2017 and the SolarWinds hack in 2020.\n\nAttacks perpetrated by Russia tend to be geopolitical in motivation, says Ciaran Martin, professor of practice in the management of public organisations, Blavatnik School of Government. He cites examples of Russian operatives spying on critical infrastructure in 2018 and electoral interference during the 2016 US election. Related Resource Secure hybrid cloud for dummies Accelerate transformation with hybrid cloud Free Download Russian cyber attacks often include DDoS and ransomware, but its state cyber capabilities are a mixture of intelligence and military, says Martin. “They are tightly controlled and very capable. Some of it is used exclusively for spying, and that is sophisticated. The more disruptive stuff is also generally highly sophistication too, because the hackers need to lurk for ages to develop their plans. The ransomware criminals don’t work for the state but they are tolerated by them; otherwise they couldn’t operate. They are much less sophisticated technically, but well organised.” Although not directly related to the conflict, the NCSC has warned businesses about a new malware called Cyclops Blink attributed to the well-known Sandworm threat actor linked to the GRU, the Russian intelligence service. “This sheds light on the evolution of Russia’s cyber capabilities,” says Daniel dos Santos, head of research at Forescout, Vedere Labs. Quantifying the cyber risk It hasn’t happened yet, but one obvious risk as the conflict continues is that Western networks are unintentionally impacted as part of Russian attacks against Ukraine – as seen in the NotPetya attack.\n\nEven so, there’s no need to panic, Ian Thornton-Trump, CISO at cyber security firm Cyjax says, adding there’s minimal chance of a “mass replicating, zero-day exploit with a destructive payload” being launched. “I think there’s restraint on Russia’s part because NATO has made it very clear they would invoke Article 5 if there was a significant Russian attributed cyber attack. Putin does not want to take on NATO in a cyber war, or a kinetic one.” This has been evident so far: Russian cyber attacks have been basic and dealt with very quickly. “While cyber attacks have happened, most have been unsophisticated DDoS and there hasn’t been anything that would fit into a cyber war level,” says Philip Ingram, MBE, a former colonel in British military intelligence. Since the start of the conflict, the cyber threat landscape has been “suspiciously quiet”, says Jamal Elmellas, COO at Focus-On-Security. “The only attacks have been DDoS – which are rudimentary and not sophisticated. In the past, we thought Russia would use cyber as a softener in physical warfare – for example, cripple Ukraine’s grid and then go in with tanks.” Despite the lack of major cyber action so far, some industries are at more risk of attack than others, especially those that operate in critical national infrastructure (CNI) such as energy firms or financial services. Sectors affected by Western sanctions could be at a heightened risk of being targeted by retaliatory cyber attacks, says Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows.',

#  {'title': 'Thousands of small businesses vulnerable to cyber attack, warns BT',
#   'text': 'UK telecoms group BT has commissioned some research which concludes thousands of small firms in the UK are without business grade security, leaving them open to cyber attack.\n\nBT commissioned a survey of 1,000 ‘decision makers’ at UK businesses, which found that many thousands of small firms in the UK are open to cyber attacks due to insufficient security measures. It estimates 51% of the ‘micro business’ sector is using security software or protocols designed for consumer use, which won’t be tailored towards defending a business.\n\nAs well as being equipped with defences that are not fit for purpose, part of the rising danger is the fact these small firms had to move so much more online over the pandemic which gives hackers more opportunities to have a crack at them. Half of all UK small businesses suffered a cyber security breach or attack last year, according to the Government’s recent Cyber Security Breaches survey.\n\n“There has been a huge shift over the past two years in the number of small firms moving their business online,” said Chris Sims, MD for BT’s Single Office/Home Office unit. “Whilst that’s a really encouraging trend, being an online business can also bring its challenges, particularly around cyber security. Any digital business – large or small – can be a target for cyber criminals, and this is something we’ve seen during the pandemic.\n\n“And whilst consumer-grade products are great for protecting you while surfing the web, accessing emails and other personal use, they’re not designed for running a business which requires more robust protection and safeguards. It’s clear that the UK’s smallest firms need more support in this area, so today we’re launching new free cyber security tools for our BT business broadband customers, together with free online advice to help upskill small businesses on how to stay safe online.”\n\nThere is some self promotion propelling the motivation to release the results of this report, since BT is piggybacking some info about its business security packages off the back of it. But regardless of that, businesses leaving themselves open (or more open than they need to be) to cyber attacks is particularly pertinent right now.\n\nUS President Biden recently issued a statement advising companies to beef up their cyber defences due to likelihood of malicious action by Russia, following its invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions placed on it primarily by the West. While directed towards US firms, it’s logical that any increase in malicious attacks from Russia would be as likely to be directed at UK firms as US ones, since the UK has been just as vocal and forthright in its opposition to Russia during the crisis.\n\nGet the latest news straight to your inbox.

#  {'title': 'Ignore Evolving Security Threats at Your Own Risk: OCR Raises Stakes on Cybersecurity in the Health Care Sector',
#   'text': 'OCR’s recent focus on cybersecurity in the health care sector sends a clear message to HIPAA covered entities and business associates: OCR expects you to implement security measures that address known threats to ePHI that are evidenced by the sharp uptick in cyber hacking incidents. To that end, recent guidance published by OCR provides some key insights on what specific security measures OCR may consider reasonable and appropriate to address those known and evolving threats to ePHI.\n\nThis post summarizes that guidance and outlines some key practical takeaways.\n\nRecent OCR Guidance on Cybersecurity\n\nIn the wake of the revelation of the “ Log4j” vulnerability , OCR Director Lisa Pino published a blog post at the end of February challenging HIPAA covered entities and business associates to “strengthen your organization’s cyber posture in 2022.” Pino noted some best practices for HIPAA covered entities and business associates, including:\n\nencryption of backups,\n\nfrequent vulnerability scanning,\n\nregular patching of software and operating systems, and\n\ntraining employees on phishing and other common IT attacks.\n\nShe also pointed out several areas of compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule “needing improvement” in the health care sector based on OCR’s 2020 breach investigations. Those areas of improvement included risk analysis, risk management, information system activity review, audit controls, security awareness and training, and authentication.\n\nShortly after Director Pino’s post, on March 17 OCR published its quarterly Cybersecurity Newsletter , focusing on “Defending Against Common Cyber-Attacks.” The Newsletter dives deeper into some of the Director’s guidance and asserts that “most cyber-attacks could be prevented or substantially mitigated if HIPAA covered entities and business associates implemented HIPAA Security Rule requirements to address the most common types of attacks.” The Newsletter advises on how covered entities and business associates can address some of those requirements and expands on ways in which organizations can address evolving threats to the security of ePHI.\n\nIn support of its message to covered entities and business associates about the need to respond to the evolving threat landscape, the Newsletter points to a sharp increase in the number of breaches reported to OCR that were caused by hacking or IT incidents (a 45% rise from 2019 to 2020), and notes that the number of breaches due to hacking or IT incidents accounted for 66% of all breaches affecting 500 or more individuals reported to OCR in 2020.\n\nKey Takeaways from Recent OCR Guidance\n\nDirector Pino’s post and the Newsletter contain some key insights for HIPAA covered entities and business associates about what security measures OCR may consider reasonable and appropriate in this new age of heightened cyber threats. To that end, we offer the following key practical takeaways:\n\n“Check the box” workforce HIPAA training may be inadequate.\n\nThe Newsletter points out that technical solutions alone will not always prevent against the threat of a cyber-attack. Instead, OCR explains that covered entities and business associates must combine technical security measures with an “engaged, educated workforce.” Although workforce training has always been a requirement of the HIPAA Security Rule, the Newsletter expands on that requirement, suggesting that workforce training should be “ongoing,” “evolving,” and “flexible enough to educate workforce members on new and current cybersecurity threats.” In particular, the Newsletter states that HIPAA security training can be ineffective if it is “viewed by workforce members as a burdensome, ‘check the box’ exercise consisting of little more than self-paced slide presentations.” The Newsletter states that organizations should instead focus on developing innovative ways to keep workforce members engaged in understanding the role they play in protecting the organization’s ePHI.\n\nIn other words, if your workforce members have been watching the same videos and completing the same HIPAA training modules for years, consider a HIPAA training refresh. Or, query whether you could supplement your existing training modules with interactive programs or periodic security reminders that meet the expectations set out in the Newsletter.\n\nRemote work conditions require special attention to access controls.\n\nDeficient user authentication measures are another area of focus in the Newsletter. OCR points out that “weak password rules and single factor authentication are among the practices that can contribute to successful attacks,” and stresses that the strength of an organization’s authentication controls should be evaluated in light of evolving working conditions. If, for example, users access systems containing ePHI remotely, the organization should consider implementing stronger user authentication solutions than were previously deployed when workers accessed ePHI only when on the organization’s premises.\n\nOrganizations that have expanded their workforce members’ ability to access ePHI from remote locations or personal devices should thus consider implementing stronger authentication solutions, such as multi-factor authentication.\n\nThere’s no excuse for not addressing known vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Newsletter emphasizes that exploiting known vulnerabilities is a common method used by hackers to penetrate covered entities’ and business associates’ networks and gain access to ePHI. OCR lists several resources that these organizations can use to identify and stay up-to-date on known vulnerabilities, such as subscribing to alerts from the HHS Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center , participating in an information sharing organization, implementing vulnerability scanning programs, and periodically conducting penetration tests to identify security weaknesses. Once vulnerabilities are identified, appropriate measures must be implemented to mitigate those vulnerabilities (e.g., applying patches, hardening systems, retiring legacy equipment).\n\nFrom a practical perspective, addressing “known vulnerabilities” should be low hanging fruit because those vulnerabilities are—by definition—known, or able to be known with reasonable diligence. Covered entities and business associates should thus have a process in place for frequently evaluating whether any of their systems used to maintain or access ePHI include vulnerabilities that leave that data exposed to a possible attack.\n\nA comprehensive, enterprise-wide risk analysis is the cornerstone of a compliant HIPAA security program.\n\nThis one might fall in the category of “old news” to some, but the number of times OCR has recently emphasized the importance of conducting a thorough, enterprise-wide risk analysis warrants a callout.\n\nIn her blog post , Director Pino put it bluntly: “I cannot underscore enough the importance of an enterprise-wide risk analysis.” In addition, throughout its discussion of the various threats to an organization’s cyber security posture, the Newsletter reminds covered entities and business associates that their risk analysis should guide the implementation of appropriate security controls. Failing to conduct a risk analysis periodically—or conducting a risk analysis that does not address all ePHI that exists across the organization—can leave your organization blind to actual threats to ePHI and unable to conduct the kind of comprehensive, forward-looking risk management strategies that OCR expects.\n\nIf your organization is covered by HIPAA and hasn’t conducted a risk analysis in a while (or ever), or if the risk analyses you have done have been too narrowly focused (e.g., only focusing on one system that maintains ePHI, such as your EHR), then now is the time to conduct a thorough enterprise-wide risk analysis.\n\n* * * *\n\nAs OCR points out in the Newsletter, malicious attacks targeting the health care sector are likely to continue to increase. Although security attacks may not be completely preventable, there are many steps that covered entities and business associates can and should take to mitigate against evolving threats to ePHI. Ignoring those threats can leave your organization vulnerable not only to data breaches, but also to OCR investigations and enforcement actions.',

#  {'title': 'In the middle of a chain reaction: mitigating cyber-risk in the retail and FMCG sector',
#   'text': 'Cyber attacks targeting corporates are on the rise globally, with an estimated 50% increase in 2021 compared with 2020.[1]\n\nThis should be cause for concern for the more than 130,000 retail trade businesses across Australia who, according to PwC, contribute revenue of over $300 billion to the Australian economy annually.[2] Of even more concern is the focus by cybercriminals on the retail and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector,[3] a problem exacerbating the challenges already faced by delays within the supply chain.\n\nWhat can companies in this sector do to mitigate the risk?\n\nIncreased risk environment\n\nLike all Australian organisations, companies in the retail and FMCG sector should be on high alert for cyber attacks. They should be advising staff to take extra care and be on the lookout for any suspicious cyber activity.\n\nTaking an enhanced cyber security posture is recommended by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The ACSC has issued a high alert status alert and warned of an increased threat of malicious cyber activity that may impact Australian organisations through business disruption or uncontained malicious cyber activities.\n\nTargeting the retail and FMCG sector\n\nOne of the reasons this sector is targeted is because of the significant amounts of customer data that is held, which often includes financial information. This means that cyber attacks can impact more than just business operations. They can create a privacy risk, which may lead to potential third-party liabilities and reputational damage when an incident occurs. This risk is heightened by COVID-19, with almost nine in 10 Australian companies adopting new technologies to support business continuity during a sharp increase in online shopping and working from home.[4]\n\nAnother reason this sector is targeted, which is arguably the sector’s biggest risk, is the reliance on interconnected supply chains. Disruption to one part can have a chain reaction. This risk is heightened by the fact that while steps can be taken within a company to ensure the best possible cyber security standards, business operations can be significantly impacted by cyber attacks against third parties.\n\nCyber attacks in the sector\n\nThe retail and FMCG sector has suffered some of the largest and most impactful cyber attacks experienced in Australia. Some examples of the way cyber attacks have affected the sector include:\n\nsupply chain attacks, where a key cog in the supply of goods is impacted, causing a ripple effect that significantly disrupts the business operations of various companies reliant on the impacted company;\n\nattacks against software providers, impacting business operations for companies reliant on the software targeted or as a means to launch a more significant attack;\n\nattacks on automated ordering systems, requiring manual order processing, additional expenses to be incurred and leading to product shortages;\n\nattacks on general IT systems, resulting in staff being unable to use their computers which materially affects business operations;\n\ntheft of customer data leading to threats to either pay a ransom or for the data to be published online; and\n\ndata breaches giving rise to a legal obligation to notify affected individuals and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (and potentially other regulators).\n\nDepending on the size of the company and severity of the incident, cyber attacks can cost businesses millions of dollars to recover from. They can also have a significant impact on a company’s reputation.\n\nIt is therefore imperative that companies in this sector understand how a cyber attack could impact their business.\n\nAssessing the risk\n\nIn 2021, the ACSC released guidelines to assist companies identify supply chain risk.[5] The ACSC recommends that organisations assess the following risks:\n\nforeign control or interference – includes foreign governments controlling or interfering with businesses in the supply chain;\n\n– includes foreign governments controlling or interfering with businesses in the supply chain; poor security practice – includes cyber security standards of third parties in the supply chain, how third parties handle cyber incidents and how they manage their employees;\n\n– includes cyber security standards of third parties in the supply chain, how third parties handle cyber incidents and how they manage their employees; lack of transparency – includes third parties sharing information about penetration testing on their network, whether contracts address cyber security standards or the right to an audit and whether there are product delivery guarantees; and\n\n– includes third parties sharing information about penetration testing on their network, whether contracts address cyber security standards or the right to an audit and whether there are product delivery guarantees; and access and privileges – includes whether third parties have in place access and privilege restrictions associated with the goods or services being offered, whether the sale is dependent on the internet and where data is stored.\n\nCompanies in the retail and FMCG sector should discuss these risks with their internal and external IT and legal advisors. While the risks cannot be eliminated, it is important to take steps to mitigate the impact that these risks can have on business operations and customers.\n\nKey tips\n\nHaving regard to the current cyber climate, and the alert by the ACSC, there has never been a more important time for companies to reassess and strengthen their cybersecurity processes.\n\nHere are some key tips which every Australian organisation, including those in the retail and FMCG sector, should adopt to strengthen their cyber security.',

#  {'title': 'Akamai Data Reveals Increase in Cyber Attacks Driven by Online Holiday Shopping',
#   'text': 'A 15% increase in malicious botnet attacks in China during the Lunar New Year and 150% increase in Japan over the Gregorian New Year represent surge in attacks\n\nSINGAPORE, April 8, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc., the world\'s most trusted solution to power and protect digital experiences, released today new data detailing the prevalence of malicious botnet attacks during the holiday season in Asia. That data found a 15 per cent increase in cyberattacks in China over the Lunar New Year in February 2022, showing that cybercriminals are actively trying to take advantage of customers during high-traffic moments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uptick in attacks continues a trend that began with Singles Day, the Chinese eCommerce festival, in November 2021, during which botnet attacks tripled. Despite gradually declining after, attack traffic remained relatively high through the end of the year before peaking again with the buildup of retail traffic during the Lunar New Year. This year, the Lunar New Year coincided with the start of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, further boosting online sales and making the period more attractive for attackers.\n\nMalicious actors operate year-round, but the high volume of traffic during holiday periods allows them to mask their attacks more easily. Additionally, customers are more likely to update their online shopping profiles with up-to-date credit card information and credentials during this period, providing a more lucrative target for attackers.\n\nAs traffic increases, attackers increase the volume of their attacks which include scraping data, draining customer accounts, damaging site functionality and holding encrypted data ransom – at massive cost to a business.\n\n"Holidays represent a huge opportunity for attackers thanks to increased online activity and security teams stretched thin," said Dr Boaz Gelbord, Akamai\'s Chief Security Officer. "APAC presents a particularly enticing opportunity for successful cyberattacks because the sheer volume of traffic gives attackers the opportunity to gain foothold more easily and operate freely without timely mitigation. Akamai works with customers to develop strategies that take into account complex attack patterns and behaviors of malicious bots during the holidays and beyond to protect brands and customer loyalty."\n\nIn Japan, Akamai research measured a 150 percent increase in malicious botnet activity in the Japanese retail sector around the Gregorian New Year in early January 2022. The attacks persisted for a number of weeks following the holiday in a nearly identical attack pattern to that observed in China.\n\nWhile a similar surge occurs during the high-traffic seen at the end-of-year holidays in EMEA and the US – China and Japan present a particularly enticing opportunity for successful cyberattacks because of the sheer volume in traffic: Retailers and eCommerce here serve some of the largest populations in the world.\n\nAkamai researchers monitored and analyzed underlying malicious botnets attack data throughout APAC during the holiday period, from late 2021 to early 2022. Akamai tracks benign and malicious bots as a proportion of internet traffic year-round to uncover patterns in botnet activity that can provide security teams with actionable data to incorporate into their defense.\n\nAbout Akamai\n\nAkamai powers and protects life online.

#  {'title': 'The success of cyber insurance lies in risk standardization',
#   'text': 'As 2021 became the year of ransomware attacks, businesses realized that failing to incorporate risk-sharing techniques into their risk management strategies can have significant financial ramifications. As a result, organizations are transferring a large part of their cyber risks to insurers. Last year alone, IT firms saw an increase in claims frequency by 46%, professional services companies by 53%, and a whopping 263% for businesses in the industrial sector, according to a report by Coalition.\n\nAs the financial impact of cyberattacks continue to surge beyond $6 trillion annually, cyber insurance is predicted to become as crucial for businesses as auto insurance is to cars and health insurance is for people. It is only a matter of time before cyber insurance becomes mandated for organizations, like workers compensation, property and liability insurance. Before this happens, what needs to be required to standardize and regulate cyber insurance? There is a win-win solution for both the payer and enterprise in the form of standardized cyber risk measurement.\n\nWhat are the current challenges in cyber insurance?\n\nWhile there has been a significant boom in the cyber insurance industry, we observe problems on both ends — the payer and the enterprise.\n\nAs the cyber industry is still a relatively new field that lacks historic data as threats continue to evolve, it is difficult for insurers to justify increasing premiums. Today, other than regulatory guidelines, there is not a definitive calculation method or transparency around how insurers justify their premium increases, the cost of reinsurance, and other surcharges. For instance, insurers who issued $5 million cyber liability policies last year have scaled back to limits between $1 million and $3 million in 2021, according to a U.S. broker Risk Placement Services (RPS) report. Similarly, many companies have been faced with cyber insurance premium increases anywhere from 75% to over 1000%, as reported by XL Net.\n\nOn the other hand, enterprise organizations researching cyber insurance are unaware of the risk level they are facing and unable to accurately calculate the financial risk they can potentially transfer compared to the amount of insurance needed. Businesses have neither defined their cyber risk appetite nor tolerance level because they have never measured the true financial impact of data breaches, incident response and their resulting business interruption. To date, cybersecurity assessments have relied on point-in-time, disintegrated and ad-hoc procedures or audits that yield pages of subjective reports that few people can understand or contextualize. While these reports expose vulnerabilities and provide insights into potential indicators of compromise, they do not inform an organization about its actual cyber risk level. They also do little to educate businesses or insurers of the financial impact of accepting, mitigating or transferring these risks through insurance. This has unfortunately fostered a cybersecurity culture that is threat-driven and reactive.\n\nHow can insurers introduce a predictive approach in the cyber insurance industry?\n\nCyberattacks are only increasing in frequency and impact. Meanwhile, businesses still rely on a reactive protection approach while the costs of recovering from an incident are also rising, which causes uncertainty with insurance providers. The solution lies in standardizing risk measurement for cyber risk insurance.\n\nAkin to putting black boxes in cars to check driving trends and behaviors to predict the chance of a road accident — cyber insurers should predict potential breaches by analyzing the real-time cybersecurity practices of a business. This will help them price premiums accurately and know the risk of underwriting, while also simultaneously guiding the business to have proactive rather than reactive cybersecurity strategies to reduce the chances of a claim settlement.\n\nThis can be done by applying a cyber risk quantification approach through machine-learning-enabled platforms that aggregate signals from the APIs of every cybersecurity product or service leveraged by a business. These areas encompass regulatory requirements, employee cybersecurity risk posture, the company’s cybersecurity policies, vulnerabilities across its hybrid technology stack, the industry type, size and geography, and the kind of data managed, stored or transferred to the business. Most importantly, this inside-out risk analysis gives both the insurance industry and end-user a real-time understanding of their cyber risk, because the data is transparently gathered from the cybersecurity products and services that already exist in the business’ environment. Once the signals are integrated and massaged by a risk quantification engine, it generates a simple-to-understand breach likelihood score that also shows the potential financial impact of a data breach.\n\nHaving both parties proactively move to embrace a standardized way of measuring, managing and mitigating cyber threats in real-time through breach-likelihood prediction is crucial. Cyber risk posture is the combination of an organization’s threats, vulnerabilities and their potential business impact. Quantifying cyber risks and placing them into two metrics provides a common denominator for all cybersecurity conversations — both within and outside of a business. These two key metrics are:\n\nThe breach likelihood per asset (people, processes, technology, supply chain, etc.). The financial impact of a data breach through each asset.\n\nWhy standardized cyber risk measurement is beneficial\n\nCyber risk quantification benefits both the enterprise and the cyber insurer by standardizing cyber risk measurement. It gives the business an absolute means to prioritize mitigation initiatives, thereby improving cyber risk posture and reducing premiums, while transferring risks through cyber insurance. Meanwhile, insurers can understand the risk they are taking on and underwrite more confidently. Ultimately, it takes businesses one step closer to being able to predict breaches before they occur and creates a dynamic relationship between the insurer and insured throughout the policy lifecycle.\n\nThis article originally ran in Today’s Cybersecurity Leader, a monthly cybersecurity-focused eNewsletter for security end users, brought to you by Security magazine.

#   'text': 'Heads have been told to read government guidance on cyber attacks to avoid being targeted by Russian "hacktivists".\n\nAn email sent by the Department for Education to school leaders today says that all public sector organisations should reconsider their risks if using Russian-based antivirus software or IT applications.\n\nThe email acknowledges that it is "highly unlikely" that most will be targeted unless they are linked to Ukraine or Russia, or if, for some reason, it could be considered a PR win for the Kremlin if they were compromised.\n\nBut the email adds: "Consideration should be given to the possibility of Russian companies being subject to sanctions, which would prevent the updating of their products, such as antivirus software."\n\nThe cyber attack risk from Russia\n\nHeads have also been told to read advice on cyber threats and "hacktivism" from the government-run National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).\n\nNCSC guidance released last week says that organisations may choose to remove Russian products and services proactively.\n\nIt adds: "Alternatively, you may choose to live with the risk. Whatever you choose, remember that cyber security, even in a time of global unrest, remains a balance of different risks."\n\nLast week headteachers were advised to consider ending energy deals with Russian suppliers.\n\nMany schools and local authorities have contracts with Russian energy giant Gazprom, and in an email to school leaders, the DfE pointed to Cabinet Office guidance to public bodies, which states that they should identify any contracts where the "prime contractor" is a Russian or Belarusian supplier and "consider terminating that contract".',

#  {'title': 'Russia-Ukraine Conflict: The Time For Cybersecurity Is Now',
#   'text': "Liudmila Chernetska/iStock via Getty Images\n\nBy Devin Ryder, CFA\n\nAs tensions soar amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, many experts consider the threat of cyberattacks to be imminent. Cyber attacks on businesses and government agencies have noticeably climbed following Russia’s invasion. Critical infrastructure such as financial institutions, governments, and utilities are all potential targets, and spillover attacks against non-primary targets are expected to become increasingly widespread. Here at ETFMG, we believe the fear of digital warfare will give added impetus to cybersecurity spending by companies, governments, and individuals.\n\nThe Threat of Cyber Warfare\n\nCountries imposing sanctions on Russia have seen an uptick in cyber attacks. For example, Nvidia (NVDA), America’s largest chipmaker, and Toyota (TM), Japan’s largest automaker, have fallen victim to cyber attacks in the time since the invasion began.1,2 While purportedly unrelated to the Eastern European conflict, both the US and Japan had recently levied significant sanctions against Russia prior to the attacks. Opportunities for retaliation against such sanctions appear limited for Russia; however, history has shown us that cyber warfare is an area they are proven to be skilled. Just this past week, the US charged four Russian government officials over two major cyber attacks against the global energy sector that affected computers in 135 countries between 2012 and 2018.3\n\nGovernments Issue Warnings\n\nThe deepening crisis has prompted government agencies across the globe to issue precautions regarding increasing cyber risk. President Joe Biden noted the heightened threat and urged American businesses to bolster their cyber defenses. Echoing the sentiment, FBI Director Christopher Wray has advised that the FBI is “concerned” with the potential threat of Russian cyberattacks against critical domestic infrastructure.4 Across the pond, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre issued an advisory, prompting organizations to take action to improve their online defenses.5 The Australian Cyber Security Centre has also urged businesses to take immediate steps to increase their cybersecurity safeguards.\n\nMonetary Threats of Cyber Attacks\n\nCybersecurity has always been a concern for individuals, corporations, and governments. However, the current conflict is exacerbating the broader trend of attacks as they continue to increase in size, volume, and sophistication. This poses major financial, reputational, and legal risks for the agencies targeted. According to security provider SonicWall, ransomware attacks climbed an unprecedented 105% year-over-year in 2021 to a total of 623.3M attacks. Encrypted threats increased 167% year-over-year to 10.1 million, almost as many as 2018, 2019, and 2020 combined.6\n\nAccording to the Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report, monetary damages caused by cyber attackers are on the rise. In fact, losses attributing to cybersecurity concerns have increased nearly sixfold, up from a median cost of $10,000 in 2020 to $57,000 in 2021 per organization. Firms responded to growing risks by increasing their cybersecurity investments by 39%.7 Despite this increase in security investments, nearly 80% of IT leaders still lack confidence in their company’s digital security.8 As threats become more prominent, the budget behind cybersecurity can be expected to grow. Cyber Security Ventures anticipates global cybersecurity spending will grow 15% year-over-year from $262 billion in 2021 to $460 billion in 2025.9\n\nInvestment Implications\n\nThe current geopolitical turmoil has significant investment implications. While the war has suppressed risk appetite as seen by sell-offs in equities, and prominently in the technology sector, cybersecurity firms have outperformed since the beginning of the war.\n\nHACK, XLK Performance (Author)\n\nThe ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK) tracks the Prime Cyber Defense Index (Ticker: PCYBER), which has been constructed as a comprehensive and diversified vehicle for access to the cybersecurity space. The pure-play exposure to the theme tracks the performance of key players that aren’t accessible with broad market ETFs. For example, using holdings from 3/24/22, the overlap between PCYBER and the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) was only 3.84%. PCYBER seeks to track leading and emerging companies within the cybersecurity ecosystem and is uniquely poised to benefit from the industry’s expansion. Companies of note in the space are Zscaler Inc. (ZS),10 Cloudflare (NET),11 and CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).12 Zscaler provides its global client base with web and mobile security, threat protection, and other networking solutions. In its latest quarterly results, the company announced 63% year-over-year revenue growth, 59% year-over-year billings growth, and 90% year-over-year growth in Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO).13,14 Cloudflare’s systems enhance the performance and security of its 140,000 customers across the globe. From 2019 to 2021, the company reported a 51% CAGR in total revenue as well as a 64% CAGR in large customers.15 CrowdStrike’s Triton platform leverages Artificial Intelligence to protect its clients from cyber attacks. In 2021, the company completed a $400 million acquisition of leading cloud log management provider Humio.16 The company’s growth plans don’t end there. Just this month, the company announced it is expanding its existing partnership with Cloudflare, integrating their platforms to provide joint customers with Zero Trust security to their devices, applications, and networks.17\n\nCompanies mentioned in this article may or may not be current holdings in any of the Funds managed by ETF Managers Group LLC.

#  {'title': 'Cyber Resilience and Data Confidentiality are Emerging Components of Healthcare',
#   'text': 'April 7th is World Health Day, and it also marks the founding of the UN’s World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948. The goal of the WHO and World Health Day is to draw attention to issues of health and well-being worldwide. To accomplish this, enduring medical initiatives aimed at expanding care options and finding efficiencies in healthcare will require even closer healthcare-cyber interconnectivity. Existing trends such as reliance on telehealth, user-driven medical, fitness, and nutritional data, and fully digital patient records will make health care data more accessible and faster than ever before. The tradeoff for these advancements is increased cyberattack surface.\n\nAccess to confidential, resilient health care services is paramount, and cybersecurity will be critical to meeting the demand for protection against threats while maintaining near-complete data availability. Unfortunately, the data suggest that healthcare-related organizations are prime targets for would-be cyber attackers, and the costs of successful attacks are rising. A study by The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) looked at cyber threats from April 2020 through July 2021 which found that ‘medical and healthcare’ was the fourth most targeted industry among the twenty surveyed (the only groups more frequently targeted were public/government, digital service providers, and the general public). And according to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report for 2021, the Healthcare industry for the past 11 years has had the dubious distinction of suffering the highest data breach costs; the cost of the average data breach for a healthcare organization grew 29% from $7.13M in 2020 to $9.23M in 2021. Though not exhaustive, the infographic below gives an idea of how widespread – both geographically and organizationally – healthcare-related cyber threats have been over the past year or so.\n\nEnsuring the digital security of the networks, data, staff, and patients that make up healthcare networks will be more critical than ever in the coming years. Cyber resilience, (the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources) , will increasingly be a factor that determines whether or not patients receive timely care, and in confidential health, data will be protected. This World Health Day, it is clearer than ever that protecting medical networks and the data in them is a necessary part of ensuring quality health care.\n\nFeatured on this map is a sample of the many health-related cyber incidents that took place from late 2020 to the present.\n\nBelgium, December 2020: The largest private laboratory processing Covid-19 tests in Belgium is a victim of a ransomware attack.\n\nIreland, May 2021: Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE) suffered a massive attack that brought services to a standstill.\n\nAlaska, USA, May 2021: The Alaska Department of Health is breached by attackers, forcing the Department to take systems offline for weeks during recovery efforts.\n\nItaly, August 2021: The online covid-19 vaccine registration portal for the region of Lazio, Italy, is attacked by criminals.\n\nNew Zealand, May 2021: In what was described as “probably the biggest cyberattack in New Zealand’s history”, networks at the Waikato District Health Board were knocked offline for weeks as staff turned to pen and paper to manage patient case data.\n\nOhio, USA, May 2021: Between May and July, hackers carried out a data breach against a DNA testing company that compromised the personal data of over two million individuals.\n\nGeorgia, USA, June 2021: The St. Joseph’s/Chandler hospital system suffers a ransomware attack in which the health information of 1.4 million patients was potentially compromised. The attackers gained access to the hospital networks six months prior to the ransomware demand.\n\nOhio, USA, August 2021: Memorial Health System acknowledged it reached a ‘negotiated settlement’ after an attack that forced the hospital to divert patients, and which compromised over 200K individuals’ health care data.\n\nAustralia, October 2021: Macquarie Health, a system that runs 12 hospitals in Eastern Australia, was the victim of a cyberattack. While the attack reportedly did not disrupt care services, several thousand confidential documents were posted to the Dark Web shortly after the attack.\n\nBrazil, December 2021: Newly observed threat group Lapsus$ claims attack on Brazil’s Ministry of Health, forcing the Ministry’s websites offline and resulting in the exfiltration of covid-tracking data. This attack was followed by a separate attack less than a week later.\n\nScotland, March 2022: A mental health charity organization was targeted by RansomEXX, who demanded a ransom. The charity refused to pay a ransom and some of its data were leaked online.\n\n\n\nAbout EclecticIQ Threat Research\n\nEclecticIQ is a global provider of threat intelligence, hunting and response technology, and services.

#  {'title': 'Why You Should Care About Netwar',
#   'text': 'Image Courtesy of The Center for Aerospace and Security Studies\n\nBy Angela Hickey\n\nAs technology advances even further there were many who believed that advances in cybersecurity would help defend a battlefield that can be reached by all just with the touch of a button, the World Wide Web.\n\n\u200b\u200bIn the recent years that we’ve had the internet on a widely accessible basis, there’s no doubt that we have created boundless opportunities and have assisted in the creation of many modern marvels. But, with these positive advances come some negative side effects.\n\nThe act of cyber warfare, according to RAND Corporation, involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation’s computers or information networks through, for example, computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks. “Netwar” on the other hand is a recently emerging consequence. The term refers to societal conflict and crime, short of war, in which the antagonists are organized more as sprawling “leaderless” networks than as tight-knit hierarchies. Many terrorists, criminals, fundamentalists, and ethno-nationalists are developing netwar capabilities.\n\nThis unsafe corner of the internet most likely reflects the unstable and rather volatile climate in the real world today.\n\n“Given the current geopolitical situation, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency requests that all organizations significantly lower their threshold for reporting and sharing indications of malicious cyber activity,” said CISA, an organization within the Department of Homeland Security in an interview with Space News.\n\nOn a more severe note more recently, the U.S. government on March 17 advised satellite operators to put their guard up in the wake of a cyberattack that disrupted internet services in Europe provided by Viasat’s KA-SAT.\n\nWhile this may seem like it has nothing to do with the average internet user, there are some serious long-term consequences that can severely affect how we as a society use the web.\n\nEspionage, ransomware, and disinformation campaigns are just a few examples of how cyberwar and netwar can be used against the average citizen. In fact, 2021 saw a surge in ransomware attacks on businesses, and according to Unit 42, a security consulting team at Palo Alto Networks, the number of cyber extortion cases will likely grow in 2022. Also, in light of the recent pandemic and people working remotely, cyberwar tactics such as these have also led to an increase in cyber warfare, which is when a country is targeted with attacks leading to damage to the state or even loss of life.\n\nCyberwarfare is a more serious issue than people would like to believe; with cyber-related crimes on the rise, many people are at a loss as to how to protect their data. Information is key in situations like these. By remaining well informed on topics such as netwar and cyberwar, you are able to keep better control over your information and simultaneously help to prevent cyber warfare from causing disruption and chaos domestically.',

#  {'title': 'Trellix releases global threat research on organisation and nation-state cyber threats',
#   'text': "Cybersecurity is a continual problem for enterprises, governments, small businesses, and home users alike. Yet, not all cyber threats are the same. Research from Trellix finds it is Governments who are behind many of the most dramatic breaches in recent times.\n\nThe Trellix global threat research, In the crosshairs: Organisations and nation-state cyber threats, shockingly reveals the service disruptions, exposed data, and substantial financial costs of the SolarWinds breach, the Microsoft Exchange Hafnium incident, and other high-profile attacks were all driven by nation-state cyberattacks.\n\nState attackers are relentless, and while cyberattacks can come from anywhere it is the government-driven nation-state attacks, along with their criminal proxies, which are the most dangerous because they are the most capable and best-resourced, and are persistent in their determination.\n\nTrellix explains it's a huge problem for the international community; victim organisations lose reputation, have innovation investments exposed or diluted, and suffer in numerous ways. In fact, Trellix finds cybercrime costs the world an estimated one trillion dollars per year.\n\nTrellix expects this will only increase because it is so rewarding to the perpetrators and there are so few penalties. How can companies defend themselves, and how can legislators develop policies to respond to nation-state actors?\n\nThese are the questions Trellix sought to answer, along with how organisations perceive and prepare for the threat of nation-state actors and how their perception actually aligns with the motivations and effects of such attacks.\n\nTrellix surveyed 800 IT security decision-makers across the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, India, and Australia over November and December 2021. Respondents came from organisations with 500 or more employees from a range of industries predominantly focused on critical infrastructure.\n\nIn the crosshairs: Organisations and nation-state cyber threats, by Trellix global research, is the result; an easily-digested - but gripping and sobering - 21-page report that CISOs, business leaders, and legislators must read.\n\nTrellix found the line between state and non-state actors continues to blur and 86% of respondents believe they have been targeted by a cyberattack from an organisation acting on behalf of a nation-state. Yet, Trellix also found only 27% of respondents are confident they can differentiate between nation-state and other cyberattacks.\n\nTrellix found state actors are more likely to focus on data than financial benefit, though it still incurs an estimated cost to the victim of more than one million dollars per incident.\n\nDespite this, Trellix also found that 10% of organisations surveyed still do not have a cybersecurity strategy. Many respondents indicated limited skills and outdated network technology and security tools increase their vulnerability.\n\n91% of respondents think the government needs to be doing more to support organisations and defend infrastructure against state-backed cyberattacks.\n\nThis is the milieux that Trellix finds global businesses sitting in. So what do we do? How can your business effectively protect itself when North Korea wants money to prop up the Kim Jong-un regime or simply takes offence, such as when Sony Pictures was hacked after releasing a movie seen as an insult to the Great Leader? What do you do to protect your business when the Russian state targets espionage in the energy sector or seeks to spread disinformation? Or, even when it targets a political enemy but its effects spread, as in the case of NotPetya which was aimed at the Ukrainian government but went worldwide? How can your business protect itself from Chinese government-sponsored IP theft? Trellix provides details on dozens of cyberattacks carried out by state actors for over a decade.\n\nTrellix finds companies and government agencies need to make decisions in an uncertain environment to protect against a range of threats. The consequences are serious for not doing so.\n\nHowever, thankfully, Trellix also finds better cybersecurity is not dependent on full certainty in the attribution of an attacker or their motives. There is still much that can be done even if it cannot be ascertained who is behind an incident.\n\nConsequently, Trellix advocates regardless of sector, organisations must ensure a baseline level of cyber hygiene and training to best defend against a wide range of incidents.\n\nThis includes updating defence capabilities, identifying what needs to be protected, assessing actual capacity, reviewing third-party providers, and increasing communication.\n\nIt's easy to say, but as the research findings identify, there are still too many companies not putting basic precautions into place.\n\nThe report is disturbing yet gripping and pulls back the covers on the shady world of cybercrime that’s well-funded and well-protected by governments themselves as they commit cyber warfare. For any business caught in the middle, you must acknowledge this is today’s reality, and you must take action.\n\nDownload the Trellix global threat research report, In the crosshairs: Organisations and nation-state cyber threats here.",

#  {'title': 'IT Insight: MDR-Managed Detection and Response',
#   'text': 'JoAnn Hodgdon\n\nSpecial to Seacoastonline\n\nGrowing threats to your personal and professional data are mounting worldwide. Cybersecurity threats must be monitored and responded to in real time as hackers work just as hard to develop and exploit new vulnerabilities. Without the necessary expertise or dedicated budget to fight this battle, your business may be falling behind in resources and falling prey to intruders.\n\nEnter MDR, Managed Detection and Response, the combination of human expertise and technology to rapidly identify and limit the possibility of threats with immediate response and remediation. It is a sensible and scalable approach to threats that involves planning and application of technology expertise to your network and endpoint security.\n\nMDR draws upon an endpoint detection and response tool that provides visibility into security breaches and events on an endpoint, such as a workstation, server, laptop, cloud system or IoT “Internet of Things”) device. This offers fast detection, mitigation and remediation of malicious activity and incidents. Manual and automated actions are then enabled to contain threats on that endpoint such as isolating that threat from the network or wiping and reimaging the endpoint device.\n\nMany of the systems in your IT environment are logging events through time. Servers, workstations, firewalls, and even your Office 365 service does that. MDR then collects and views all the logs that are generated by these systems. Then, additional agents or software programs are added to certain devices, servers and sometimes to workstations that can look for additional information. Further, a SIEM (security information and event management tool) is utilized that gathers all this data, helps organize it, analyze it, and correlate this data within your network in real time.\n\nTo understand what type of event you are looking at a human analyst is involved to determine the appropriate response and reduce the impact and risk associated. Initially it needs to be determined that this is not a false positive. For instance, an intentional upgrade of a system could cause a security monitoring system to react. Being aware of false positives is managed and reported by your IT provider through a process called white listing, where upgrades and additional services that may generate a false positive are known ahead of time. However, a thorough system never pauses should human information not be readily available. Cyber-attacks can happen very quickly, and a response must happen immediately. Assuming that there is no immediate indication that it is a false positive, then stopping the attack is imminent.\n\nIn cases, a threat can be killed. In some cases, it can be blocked. Sometimes you can quarantine these operations. However, nothing is destroyed; it is stopped from infecting the endpoint or any other segments of your network. When the process is stopped and contained and the environment is protected, the human investigation begins. It needs to be determined what the source of the problem was. Were there weaknesses in protection that need to be addressed? This needs to be classified, tracked, and reported.\n\nThe last step is recovery. MDR restores systems to their pre-attack state by removing malware, cleaning the registry, removing intruders, and ensuring that the network is returned to a healthy state with further compromise prevented.\n\nThe MDR services in the form that exists today are relatively new, but the things that they can do, large enterprises have done for at least the last decade and very security-sensitive organizations have done for a longer period. Like all things that involve cyber-crime, targets have become smaller and smaller. New developments like ransomware as a service allows small criminals to attack small organizations. Therefore, smaller organizations that do not have the capabilities in their own staff to monitor these instances need to be very concerned. MDR was developed to provide these capabilities to a smaller organization.\n\nCyber-attacks have become more sophisticated. Initially an attack would infiltrate the system from the outside and the concern was protecting the perimeter of the system. They would attack one workstation or one server at a time. Initially we worried about the antivirus software and the endpoint text and respond, which is really protecting one workstation, one computer at a time.\n\nNow, more sophisticated attacks include small steps, each of which independently, may not look unusual. For instance, a completely innocuous file may be sent to one individual. Further, a lateral attack is launched with an attempt to move elsewhere within the network environment. Accordingly, if you are only looking at things one workstation at a time, those kinds of attacks are overlooked. It is truly that level of sophistication that has made MDR critical, even for the SMB environment.\n\nAs a business without cybersecurity expertise, it is not just about detecting and blocking attacks. It is about making sure that your business is protected preventatively as attack methods and techniques change over time.\n\nLook for this support from someone that will be your security advisor, rather than just provide a commoditized service. It is critical that these services are running 24/7/365, as cyber criminals do not take time off. In fact, they are most active while you are sleeping.\n\nThe security environment has changed enormously and things that businesses could once safely ignore, they just cannot afford anymore. The scope of integrated security is vast – trust your information security to experts that build, execute, and manage this end to end.\n\nJoAnn Hodgdon is vice president and co-founder of Portsmouth Computer Group (PCGiT) with her husband David.

#  {'title': 'New Cyber Incident Reporting Law Covering Range of Critical Infrastructure Companies',
#   'text': 'On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (the “Act”) as part of an omnibus appropriations bill. The Act compels “covered entities” — companies in a “critical infrastructure sector”— to report to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) within 24 hours of making a ransomware payment or within 72 hours of reasonably believing that it experienced a “substantial cyber incident.”1 In addition, the Act imposes a requirement on covered entities to preserve all data relevant to the cyber incident or ransom payment.2 Covered entities are also subject to an ongoing requirement to update CISA promptly with new, important information until cyber incidents are fully mitigated and resolved.3\n\nThe legislation was fast-tracked in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and fears that the conflict could lead to significant cyber-attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure. The Act thus expands CISA’s ability to track, share information about, and respond to significant cyberattacks and ransomware payments, placing CISA at the helm of the federal government’s response to major cyber incidents less than four years after the Agency’s creation. Notably, although the Act had broad bipartisan support, the DOJ and FBI publicly opposed the legislation, arguing that “it would slow down the FBI’s response to hacks and hamper the government’s ability to identify and disrupt other ongoing attacks.” The White House, however, supported the Act’s passage, and CISA committed to sharing incident reports “immediately” with the FBI.\n\nMany of the Act’s key definitions are reserved for rulemaking. Among other items, there is considerable ambiguity about:\n\nWhich companies will be considered “covered entities,” Which substantial cyber incidents must be reported, and What data must be retained and reporting, on an ongoing basis, relating to covered cyber incidents.\n\nThe rulemaking process is expected to last up to two years from the Act’s passage. However, the Act provides some hints of how these terms will be interpreted, and companies would be wise to begin preparing for the Act’s enforcement now.\n\nAs a threshold matter, companies should consider whether they are likely to be classified as “covered entities.” The Act defines “covered entity” to mean an entity in a critical infrastructure sector, as defined in Presidential Policy Directive PPD-21 (“PPD-21”). PPD-21 identifies 16 critical infrastructure sectors: chemical; commercial facilities; communications; critical manufacturing; dams; defense industrial base; emergency services; energy; financial services; food and agriculture; government facilities; healthcare and public health; information technology; nuclear reactors, materials, and waste; transportation systems; and water and wastewater systems. But PPD 21 does not enumerate how a company would determine if they fit within one (or more) of those sectors, so the required rulemaking will be the primary source of information for companies that seek to determine their status as a critical infrastructure provider. The Act also specifies that CISA will conduct outreach to “likely covered entities” to inform them of the requirements.\n\nThe Act specifies that rulemaking must include a “clear description of the types of substantial cyber incidents that constitute covered cyber incidents.” What constitutes “substantial” cyber incidents will be defined in subsequent rulemaking, but must include incidents, among others, that lead to substantial loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems or involve disruption of business or industrial operations. What constitutes a “covered cyber incident” lacks clarity, but the Act appears to limit the required reporting to only actual and substantial cyber incidents. In other words, cyber incidents that fail to materialize and immaterial cyber incidents may not be subject to the Act’s reporting and retention requirements.\n\nThe Act suggests that covered entities will be required to disclose a substantial amount of information in their cyber incident reports, including but not limited to: a description of the function of the affected systems, networks or devices; description of the unauthorized access; description of the vulnerabilities exploited and security defenses in place; and the categories of information that were or were reasonably believed to have been accessed without authorization. These reporting requirements will be ongoing until the cyber incident has concluded and has been fully mitigated and resolved, meaning that reporting obligations for a single incident could continue for years until full mitigation and resolution is achieved. Accordingly, companies should consider whether they have appropriate internal processes in place to investigate incidents and collect relevant evidence.\n\nIn cases of non-compliance with the Act, CISA is authorized to engage directly with covered entities that it believes failed to report information about a cyber incident or ransom payment, including by issuing a subpoena to compel the disclosure of information. If a covered entity fails to comply with the subpoena, CISA may refer the matter to the Attorney General for enforcement and potential contempt of court proceedings. These requirements are imposed against a heightened DOJ enforcement backdrop in which the Civil-Cyber Fraud Initiative seeks to leverage the False Claims Act to hold accountable contractors and recipients of federal funds and grants that knowingly violate contractual obligations to monitor and report cybersecurity incidents and breaches.\n\nAlthough the Act’s reporting requirements will not become effective for some time, companies with operations that relate to the PPD-21 critical infrastructure sectors should take steps now to ensure that they have systems in place to comply with the Act. Among other issues, companies should evaluate: (1) whether they are likely to fall within the Act’s definition of covered entities subject to reporting and retention requirements, (2) processes to create timely reports in the event of a covered cyber incident or ransomware payment, and (3) capabilities to preserve and collect relevant data in the event of a cyber incident. Companies should also consider how the reporting requirements of the Act might overlap with other disclosure obligations — such as the SEC’s proposed rule on cybersecurity risk management for public companies — and determine whether changes to their cyber policies may be required. Finally, given that the Act leaves much of the detail to the rulemaking process, concerned companies may also wish to draft and submit comments for consideration in rulemaking.\n\n1 §§ 2242(a)(1)(A), (2)(A).\n\n2 § 2242(a)(4).\n\n3 § 2242(a)(3).',

#  {'title': 'Russian-backed hackers broke into Facebook accounts of Ukrainian military officials',
#   'text': 'A group of hackers with ties to the Belarusian government broke into the Facebook accounts of Ukrainian military officials and posted videos calling on the Ukrainian army to surrender. According to Facebook\'s parent company, Meta, the posts appeared as if they were coming from the legitimate account owners.\n\nThe group of hackers, known in the security industry as Ghostwriter, typically targets victims by compromising their email addresses and using them to gain access to social media accounts.\n\n"When it comes to persistent threat actors, we\'ve seen a further spike in activity by Ghostwriter," Ben Nimmo, Meta\'s global threat intelligence lead for influence operations, said on a call with reporters. He added that since February, "they\'ve attempted to hack into the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukrainian military personnel."\n\nMeta\'s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gliecher, said the videos posted on the accounts of Ukrainian military officials were not seen by users and were taken down by the platform before it could be shared with others.\n\nMeta also removed a network of 200 accounts operating from Russia that were falsely filing hundreds — and in some cases thousands — of reports against users, mainly in Ukraine and Russia, for various policy violations. The mass reporting was an attempt to silence critics and Ukrainians, Meta said.\n\nThe operation spiked in mid-February, just before Russia invaded Ukraine. The actors used a variety of fake, authentic and duplicate accounts to falsely report users for violations of hate speech and bullying. Meta said in an attempt to evade detection, the threat actors coordinated their mass reporting activity in a cooking-themed Facebook group that had about 50 members when discovered.\n\n"Since Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, we\'ve seen attacks on internet freedom and access to intensify information sharply," said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs at Meta. He said those attacks are manifested through Russian state propaganda, media influence operations, espionage campaigns and attempts to close the flow of credible information.\n\nMeta said threat actors with links to Russia and Belarus who are engaging in cyber espionage and covert influence operations have an interest in the Ukrainian telecom industry, defense and energy sectors, tech platforms and journalists.\n\nBut Ukrainian officials believe Russia is behind the disinformation efforts, timed to coincide with conventional warfare. "Cyberwar is a component of conventional war, provided by Russia against Ukraine," said top Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora during a briefing with reporters on Tuesday.\n\nOne group with ties to the Belarusian KGB, which Meta previously took down in November, returned with a new operation a day before Russia\'s invasion began. Meta said the group "suddenly" began posting in Polish and English about Ukrainian troops surrendering and leaders surrendering without a fight.\n\nOn March 14, the group created an event in Warsaw calling for a protest against the Polish government, Meta alleged. The event was on the platform for "a few hours at most" and taken down along with the account behind it, Nimmo said.\n\nNew information about threat actors with ties to Russia who are targeting Ukrainian officials and public figures on Facebook is part of the company\'s new quarterly Adversarial Threat report. It builds on the existing quarterly community standards report and the monthly coordinated inauthentic behavior report.\n\nThe disinformation campaign by Russian-aligned actors targeting Ukrainians on social media and online comes at the same time as other cyberattacks targeting Ukrainian government agencies, media groups and telecommunications.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine announced Thursday it uncovered another text message campaign pushing 5,000 SMS messages to Ukrainian military and law enforcement officers demanding that they defect and surrender to Russian forces.\n\n"The outcome of events is predetermined!" the messages said, according to Ukrainian officials. "Be prudent and refuse to support nationalism and leaders of the country who discredited themselves and already fled the capital!!!"\n\nBetween March 23 and March 29, Ukrainian critical infrastructure registered 65 cyberattacks – five times more than the previous week – according to a report by Ukraine\'s State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection (SSSCIP).\n\nThe agency said top targets included state and local authorities, the security and defense sector, financial companies, satellite telecommunications and the energy sector.\n\n"We do not see serious and complicated attacks on critical infrastructure which can be successful so far," said Zhora, deputy chief of Ukraine\'s SSSCIP. "We register attempts, but I hope we will be able to effectively counteract them and provide security to our IT systems."\n\nBut hackers did launch a "sophisticated and massive" attack against the infrastructure of one of Ukraine\'s largest providers, Ukrtelecom, on March 28, Kirill Goncharuk, the company\'s chief information officer, told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe attack against Ukrtelecom was launched from inside Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory, though Goncharuk did not disclose the specific location, citing security reasons.\n\nGoncharuk said hackers used an employee\'s compromised account to gain entry. The employee is currently safe, but the CIO declined to say whether the individual was physically coerced into handing over access.\n\nTraffic in the network fell to 13% of the regular regime of the network\'s functioning but, according to the SSSCIP, Ukrtelecom security experts detected the attack within 15 minutes after its launch and restored 85% of service within 24 hours.\n\nDuring the attack, intruders attempted to disable the company\'s servers and take control of Ukrtelecom\'s network by attempting to change the passwords of employees\' accounts as well as the passwords to equipment and firewalls, according to Goncharuk.\n\nInvestigators say it appears that the attackers did not access customer data. Officials have not yet attributed the attack. The investigation – in coordination with Microsoft and Cisco – is ongoing.\n\n"The majority of [cyber]attacks that come to Ukrainian infrastructure at the moment have Russian origins," Zhora told reporters. "And it doesn\'t matter whether the FSB or GRU originate it. Different APT groups can sit on the same floor in the same buildings."\n\nThe hack follows an attack on U.S. telecommunications firm Viasat on February 24 that targeted terminals in Ukraine but also caused outages in Germany and other European countries at the start of the Russian invasion.\n\nA U.S. official tells CBS News that American intelligence officials believe Russian state-actors were behind the Viasat hack, though the White House has not publicly said so.\n\nU.S. officials believe it was meant to disrupt service in Ukraine but spread beyond the intended targets.\n\nThe Biden administration remains concerned that cyberattacks targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure could "spill over" to the U.S. and its allies, similar to events surrounding the 2017 NotPetya malware attack.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told "CBS Evening News" anchor and managing editor Norah O\'Donnell on Wednesday that Russian actors "have not attacked our critical infrastructure in retaliation to the sanctions we\'ve imposed."\n\n"We are preparing for an attack," Mayorkas added, noting that U.S. officials are on high alert for potential breaches of critical infrastructure, including U.S. banks, the energy grid and water system. "We are poised to defend ourselves."\n\nTestifying in the Senate this week, U.S. Cyber Command chief Gen. Paul Nakasone cautiously supported the creation of a "social media data threat analysis center" to help combat foreign influence campaigns.\n\n"Based on my experience, watching two different election cycles and the work of our adversaries attempt to garner greater influence, I think such a center would be helpful," he told lawmakers, adding that researchers must evaluate "the full spectrum" of adversaries\' capabilities, including tactics, tradecraft and procedures."',

#  {'title': '5 steps to strengthen cybersecurity defenses in wake of Ukraine-Russia crisis',
#   'text': 'With the ongoing events in Ukraine, it is to be expected that the type of cyberattacks will become more aggressive, advanced, and persistent due to the involvement of state actors and organized crime.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, Conti, a ransomware gang affiliated with Russia, has gone public with the intent to engage in retributive actions against governments that introduce sanctions against its host state. These threats should not be taken lightly, as anyone can become a victim of these extremely threatening cyberattacks — both directly and indirectly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn today’s current situation, the threat largely seems to apply to industries that are utilitarian, relevant to government or social function — or simply large enterprises that are high-profile and would thus generate media attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven our ecosystem and supply chain, even if organizations might not directly be a target, it has been seen that organizations can still indirectly be affected by the cyberattacks of companies they interact with or subcontract with.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough it sounds daunting, actions are available to strengthen an organization’s cybersecurity posture.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are five practical steps for increasing an organization’s security posture:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Analysis\n\nThreat intelligence is critical in analyzing potential cyber threats. It enables organizations to evaluate the validity and impact on the organization.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizations benefit from high-quality threat intelligence feeds and suppliers with historical knowledge and experience with relevant threat intel related to state-related attacks. If an organization does not have threat intelligence sources, free and publicly available options can be utilized. For example, government CERTs, industry-specific publications, and vendor reports are good sources for threat intelligence and proactive measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to integrate threat intelligence into other security solutions within an organization, whether through STIX/TAXII or directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Detection\n\nA good cybersecurity defense requires an effective detective mechanism based on the foundational mechanism of Sysmon to allow the detection of a wide range of attacks. One of these is ransomware, a mainstay amongst instigators perpetrating advanced and persistent cyberattacks. An example would be PowerShell activity, common to almost all types of malware in the wild.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizations should start with the Sysmon configuration template hosted here. Sysmon can be downloaded from the dedicated Microsoft Page and deployed through Group Policy. Deploy it on endpoints as well as servers for holistic protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Protection\n\nAccount control is one of the most important aspects of an organization’s security. Whether petty criminals or governments, all entities utilize the strategy of gaining control of valid credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost security solutions are equipped to deal with account takeover. Looking for sophisticated solutions that detect, investigate and respond automatically will help an organization from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, owning a sophisticated and automated solution is not necessary to secure an organization’s accounts. Restricting privileges and setting up password requirements in Active Directory is the first essential step toward account security. This is also doable with orchestration solutions if the organization’s environment is mixed or Linux-based or has a wide fleet of virtual machines.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccount control provides a countermeasure to some of the most destructive strains of malware, such as ransomware, including Conti’s, as described above. Regular security best practices are just as important, for example, regular periodic backups, multi factor authentication (MFA), etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in the situation of Conti, when actors announced malicious intent as opposed to pure financial benefit, organizations should look at less explored controls — such as segmenting away the most valuable infrastructure, primarily data, given the nature of the adversary, as well as implementing at the very least a basic honeypot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter would be important for rapid detection; even a single server not accessed by users is easy to monitor through almost any solution — and most ransomware tactics still involve discovery and lateral movement that will eventually touch it as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Response\n\nIn the modern environment, it’s crucial to have a centralized overview. This can be achieved by a basic log management solution or more advanced solutions, like a SIEM. A SIEM provides the ability to contextualize, evaluate, validate, and investigate across multiple security controls, giving operations and response teams a much-needed health overview of an organization’s IT infrastructure resulting in a quicker response to potential threats.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have a SIEM or other aggregation/orchestration solution, it is easy to configure a much tighter feedback loop in terms of time-to-detect of a particular threat. For example, a SIEM can implement alerting configured to detect wider patterns than a singular message.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Recovery and Business Continuity\n\nFrom a resilience perspective, engage, test, and run drills on the business continuity plans. Organizations should expect to be impacted and ensure that staff is trained, systems have restoration capability, and response teams have the necessary tools to recover from an impact on their IT infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nA common capability in any recovery situation would be to have recovery tools such as incident management, communications channels, restoration points etc. If the IT infrastructure is unavailable due to an attack, the incident team will need platforms to manage the incident, communicate, access recovery plans and access data recovery points.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese steps should increase an organization’s security posture to protect against any potential attacks related to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia crisis. It is important to realize that there is no perfect security strategy, but a defender can, with a bit of effort, make it significantly more difficult for a sophisticated attacker to succeed.',

With over 90,000 local government organizations and dozens of agencies and offices per state, each housing troves of sensitive data, the attack surface is enormous.\n\nNotably, the methods cybercriminals employ to carry out these attacks have changed dramatically in recent years, largely because of the national shift to telework. Therefore, defenses against such attacks must shift to fit the new threat landscape.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the Washington, D.C., police force, the city of Minneapolis, Chatham County, N.C., the Hampton Roads, Va., Sanitation District, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority and the Alaska Health and Social Services Department are among the hundreds of state and local agencies that have been victims of cybercrime. The variety and breadth of organizations attacked underscores that no one is immune to these financially disastrous attacks, and recent government initiatives are finally acknowledging that reality.\n\nThe White House’s Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity recognizes the need to adopt a zero trust model in the face of current cyber threats at the federal level. However, for state and local agencies to continually interface with federal agencies, they must make similar moves toward zero trust. Given the frequency and severity of cyberattacks against state and local government organizations, a shift to zero trust offers much more than interoperability.\n\nZero trust has become somewhat of a buzzword of late, but it is imperative to highlight that zero trust is not a tangible product or service, but an evolving collection of cybersecurity paradigms and concepts: an architecture. Central principles of a zero trust architecture include continuous validation and authentication and simplified access control enforcement.\n\nState and local agencies are as valuable a target as federal agencies to most threat actors, and if the federal government is struggling to keep pace with bad actors, state and local governments’ limited resources only compounds their vulnerabilities, especially with the shift to remote work.\n\nA BeyondTrust survey of federal, state and local government security professionals found remote worker or contractor vulnerabilities to be the No. 1 reported security risk, with 65% of respondents ranking it as their top priority. Today’s remote or hybrid workplace has increased the potential attack surface with the exponentially greater number of devices, apps, cloud environments and access points.\n\nThe survey also found that 80% of IT security professionals say that the shift to remote work is increasing the focus on identity security. It is apparent that controlling identity is the critical first step to constructing a zero trust architecture that meets the requirements of hybrid, cloud and multicloud network infrastructures.\n\nOne of the first actions state and local agencies can take is to contextualize network activity. If organizations can accurately understand how their users typically behave, they can defend themselves accordingly. To obtain this level of insight, access must be tied to a master concept of identity. Because a single user could theoretically access data in multiple roles or locations, the network must carry that user’s master identity with them, while simultaneously shedding access permissions for the data that identity no longer needs.\n\nPrivileged access management is the keystone of any zero trust architecture. PAM encompasses the strategies and technologies used to control privileged access and permissions for users, accounts, processes and systems across an IT environment.\n\nMalicious actors seek to acquire privileged credentials via phishing or malware attacks because such credentials allow them to move laterally in an IT environment and obtain the most sensitive information. As such, privileged password management, endpoint privilege management and secure remote access are three core solutions PAM platforms that can help state and local agencies prevent these types of attacks and enforce zero trust.\n\nThe shift to zero trust necessitates a new mindset. The days of merely updating antivirus software and using castle-and-moat defenses are long gone. As cybercriminals grow increasingly sophisticated, so too must cybersecurity defenses. That is why zero trust architectures are the product of several interlocking technologies and policies, which no single vendor can provide.\n\nIronically, if state and local government agencies hope to maintain the trust of their employees and citizens, they must work toward achieving a zero trust security architecture.\n\nJosh Brodbent is regional vice president, public sector solutions engineering, with BeyondTrust.',

#   'text': 'China\'s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Thursday the report had been "noted" by Beijing, but that China "firmly opposes and combats any form of cyberattacks, and will not encourage, support or condone any cyberattacks."\n\n"I would like to advise the company concerned that if they really care about global cybersecurity, they should pay more attention to the cyberattacks by the U.S. government hackers on China and other countries, and do more to help promote dialogue and cooperation among countries, instead of using the cyberattack issue to stir up trouble and throw mud at China," he told reporters.\n\nIndian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India hasn\'t discussed the issue with China.\n\n"We have seen reports. There is a mechanism to safeguard our critical infrastructure to keep it resilient. We haven\'t raised this issue with China," he said.\n\nIndian Minister of Power R.K. Singh said the report was not a cause for concern.\n\n"We are always prepared," he said. "We have a very robust security system. We are always alert."\n\nInsikt Group already detected and reported a suspected Chinese-sponsored hack of 10 Indian power sector organizations in February 2021 by a group known as RedEcho. The more recent hack "displays targeting and capability consistencies" with RedEcho, but there are also "notable distinctions" between the two so the group has been given the working name of Threat Activity Group 38, or TAG-38, as more information is gathered.\n\nFollowing a short lull after its first report, Recorded Future said the Insikt Group again started tracking hacking attempts on India\'s power grid organizations. Over the last several months, through late March, it identified likely network intrusions targeting at least seven of India\'s so-called "State Load Dispatch Centers" - all in proximity to the disputed border in Ladakh, where Chinese and Indian troops clashed in June 2020, leaving 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese dead.\n\n"Recorded Future continues to track Chinese state-sponsored activity groups targeting a wide variety of sectors globally - a large majority of this conforms to longstanding cyber espionage efforts, such as targeting of foreign governments, surveillance of dissident and minority groups, and economic espionage," the report said.\n\n"However, the coordinated effort to target Indian power grid assets in recent years is notably distinct from our perspective and, given the continued heightened tension and border disputes between the two countries, we believe is a cause for concern," it added.\n\nHackers are thought to have gained access through third-party devices connected to the internet, like IP cameras, which had been compromised, the company said.\n\nInvestigators have not yet determined how they had been compromised, but Recorded Future suggested they may have originally been installed using default credentials, leaving them vulnerable.\n\nBecause the prolonged targeting of India\'s power grid "offers limited economic espionage or traditional intelligence-gathering opportunities," Recorded Future said it seems more likely the goal is to enable information gathering around surrounding critical infrastructure systems, or to be pre-positioned for future activity.\n\n"The objective for intrusions may include gaining an increased understanding into these complex systems in order to facilitate capability development for future use or gaining sufficient access across the system in preparation for future contingency operations," Recorded Future said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ashok Sharma in New Delhi contributed to this story.',

Such skills made these individuals a "natural fit" for cybersecurity roles, said Ensign, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of local telco StarHub and state-owned investment firm Temasek Holdings.\n\nThree hires already had undergone a training curriculum that encompassed IT basics, networking, and cybersecurity fundamentals. In addition, these individuals received specialised training that included operations managed by Security Operations Centre (SOC) and were taught how to handle attack vectors.\n\nEnsign has employed these individuals as SOC analysts, one of whom is associate SOC analyst Daryl Loh. Expressing his support for the programme, Loh said now was able to monitor and analyse security threats, as well as advise his clients when relevant alerts surfaced.\n\nEnsign said it was targeting to hire up to 16 neurodiverse individuals a year, running the training programme up to four times annually.\n\nThe security vendor added that it hoped to have such employees account for 2% to 3% of its total workforce. It also rolled out an "structured" strategy across its organisation to help these individuals acclimatise and integrate with their colleagues.\n\nARC\'s executive director Jacelyn Lim said: "We hope this [programme] may become a blueprint for companies in the technology and cybersecurity sectors to harness the potential of these individuals in employment."\n\nEnsign\'s CIO and executive vice president of managed security services Steven Ng said: "We are confident our neurodiverse employees will introduce new thinking and fresh ideas to help us evolve our strategies, services, and solutions. We are also elevating our capabilities by hiring mid-career professionals from other industries and encouraging more female cyber talents to join the sector. This is part of our strategy to ensure we have the capabilities to constantly innovate and stay ahead of emerging cyber threats.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE',

#   'text': 'Lessons from Quantum Dawn: the biennial US financial sector cyber security exercise\n\nDetails Published: Thursday, 07 April 2022 07:48\n\nSIFMA has released a summary of key recommendations from its biennial Quantum Dawn cyber security exercise, which was conducted in November 2021. This event enabled financial firms, central banks, regulatory authorities, trade associations, law enforcement and information sharing organizations around the world to rehearse incident response protocols, both internally and across the sector, against a broad range of significant ransomware attacks targeting the financial sector.\n\nParticipants included over 1,000 representatives from 240 public and private sector institutions, including financial firms, central banks, regulators, and law enforcement entities, across more than 20 countries around the world.\n\n“A clear takeaway from the exercise is the importance of a robust partnership between the industry and government grounded in information sharing,” said Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., SIFMA president and CEO. “No single actor — not the federal government, nor any individual firm — has the resources to protect markets from cyber threats on their own. Firms should also continually exercise their crisis management, incident response, and data recovery plans to ensure rapid response and recovery from ransomware or other types of cyber-attacks.”\n\nAlong with SIFMA, global consulting firm Protiviti helped organize the simulation and prepare the After-Action Report with recommendations aimed to help the sector strengthen its readiness to defend critical financial services infrastructure from an array of cyberattacks and extreme scenarios.\n\nThose recommendations include:\n\nMake critical investments in capabilities\n\nInstitutions should continue to invest in robust ransomware recovery and cyber, business continuity and information technology incident response plans and strengthen these plans based on frequent exercises and tests.\n\nCreate alternate communication channels for worst-case scenarios\n\nIn the event a regulatory authority is impacted by a ransomware event and goes offline, firms should have processes in place to use alternate communications channels.\n\nBeware: Ransom payments may not lead to data recovery\n\nSIFMA does not recommend paying a ransom. Executives need to carefully consider the realities of taking such actions, including the possibility that they still may not recover stolen data.\n\nJoin global directory of critical stakeholders\n\nFinancial firms are strongly encouraged to join SIFMA’s Global Directory of critical stakeholders. This directory was created to identify critical public and private sector organizations and key contacts that play a role in crisis management and global information sharing.\n\nFollow best practices\n\nValidate that critical infrastructure assets are not exposed to the public Internet.\n\nInstitute controls such as self-service password management requiring a second factor to avoid being socially engineered.\n\nRequire multi-factor authentication (MFA) everywhere.\n\nDeploy modern-day Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) systems to detect backdoor accounts.\n\nUse a privileged account management (PAM) system to check in-and-out access to accounts or deploy even more advanced defenses for critical admin-level accounts.\n\nIsolate and disconnect infected machines immediately.\n\nDevelop proactive threat hunting capabilities.\n\nMore details.',

#  {'title': "Hamas-linked Hackers Targeting High-Ranking Israelis Using 'Catfish' Lures",
#   'text': 'A threat actor with affiliations to the cyber warfare division of Hamas has been linked to an "elaborate campaign" targeting high-profile Israeli individuals employed in sensitive defense, law enforcement, and emergency services organizations.\n\n"The campaign operators use sophisticated social engineering techniques, ultimately aimed to deliver previously undocumented backdoors for Windows and Android devices," cybersecurity company Cybereason said in a Wednesday report.\n\n"The goal behind the attack was to extract sensitive information from the victims\' devices for espionage purposes."\n\nThe monthslong intrusions, codenamed "Operation Bearded Barbie," have been attributed to an Arabic-speaking and politically-motivated group called Arid Viper, which operates out of the Middle East and is also known by the monikers APT-C-23 and Desert Falcon.\n\nMost recently, the threat actor was held responsible for attacks aimed at Palestinian activists and entities starting around October 2021 using politically-themed phishing emails and decoy documents.\n\nThe latest infiltrations are notable for their specific focus on plundering information from computers and mobile devices belonging to Israeli individuals by luring them into downloading trojanized messaging apps, granting the actors unfettered access.\n\nThe social engineering attacks involved the use of fake personas on Facebook, relying on the tactic of catfishing to set up fictitious profiles of attractive young women to gain the trust of the targeted individuals and befriend them on the platform.\n\n"After gaining the victim\'s trust, the operator of the fake account suggests migrating the conversation from Facebook over to WhatsApp," the researchers elaborated. "By doing so, the operator quickly obtains the target\'s mobile number."\n\nOnce the chat shifts from Facebook to WhatsApp, the attackers suggest the victims that they install a secure messaging app for Android (dubbed "VolatileVenom") as well as open a RAR archive file containing explicit sexual content that leads to the deployment of a malware downloader called Barb(ie).\n\nOther hallmarks of the campaign have included the group leveraging an upgraded arsenal of malware tools, including the BarbWire Backdoor, which is installed by the downloader module.\n\nThe malware serves as a tool to completely compromise the victim machine, allowing it to establish persistence, harvest stored information, record audio, capture screenshots, and download additional payloads, all of which is transmitted back to a remote server.\n\nVolatileVenom, on the other hand, is Android spyware that\'s known to spoof legitimate messaging apps and masquerade as system updates and which has been put to use in different campaigns by Arid Viper since at least 2017.\n\nOne such example of a rogue Android app is called "Wink Chat," where victims attempting to sign up to use the application are presented an error message that "it will be uninstalled," only for it to stealthily run in the background and extract a wide variety of data from the mobile devices.\n\n"The attackers use a completely new infrastructure that is distinct from the known infrastructure used to target Palestinians and other Arabic-speakers," the researchers said.\n\n"This campaign shows a considerable step-up in APT-C-23 capabilities, with upgraded stealth, more sophisticated malware, and perfection of their social engineering techniques which involve offensive HUMINT capabilities using a very active and well-groomed network of fake Facebook accounts that have been proven quite effective for the group."',

#  {'title': 'It’s time for SMBs to protect against ransomware',
#   'text': 'While cyberattacks might not be top of mind for the local gym, restaurant or retail store, they should be. Ransomware is no longer an issue reserved for large organizations. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) accounted for 82% of attacks in 2021.\n\nWhy now? Ransomware has been a threat for many years. However, as a result of the pandemic and people working remotely, its growth has been exponential. During the first half of 2021, the global attack volume increased 151%.\n\nRansomware groups now have their sights set on SMBs for three reasons:\n\nThey don’t necessarily have internal security support and know-how.\n\nThey often use out-of-date and/or unpatched software.\n\nThey haven’t considered themselves at risk since most of the attention is on the big, high-profile businesses and organizations.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. government, including the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), recently issued a warning urging all businesses to take action to mitigate the risks as the Russia-Ukraine war unfolds.\n\n5 common SMB security mistakes and how to fix them\n\nThese five common security mistakes can leave smaller organizations vulnerable to cyber threats and risks.\n\nMisconfiguring a virtual private network (VPN). The traditional VPN does not have adequate control over who or what device can connect to the network. VPNs are legacy technologies and are relatively easy to configure, but if security teams don’t define the level of access, they make it easier for intruders to gain access. VPNs are often exploited because there is no standard way to set them up, operate and distribute access. Each IT department configures them in a way that makes sense to them, which can introduce risk. Organizations will want to ensure the access channel is secured to protect data and confidentiality. Relying on legacy technology. Many companies rely on outdated systems because of cost, such as the combination of a VPN and remote desktop protocol (RDP). Remote employees typically use VPNs and RDP to remotely access the systems they need on the network to perform their work, but these tools were never meant to manage remote employees across a range of devices. More modern technologies exist that are designed for secure access by remote staff. Thinking that a firewall is enough. A firewall often gives companies a false sense of security. And now that perimeters have expanded and morphed, a firewall doesn’t solve security problems, especially if hackers are getting more creative with phishing techniques to break into a system. The weakest links are usually employees and most compromises are caused by a simple error, such as an employee clicking on a harmful link, saving a damaging file, using a weak password, or forwarding sensitive information. Skipping backup. While backing up data may seem like a no-brainer, many organizations often overlook this step. A frequent backup strategy is essential, especially to protect financial data, intellectual property, source code and email. As security leaders define a backup strategy to protect company data, start with securing mission critical data first. A backup plan may involve cloud-based backup services or offsite storage. Forgetting patches. Similarly, this step often gets skipped. Don’t leave an organization and employees vulnerable when security updates and patches are available. Patch and update everything: operating systems, applications, firmware and devices.\n\nFour cybersecurity priorities\n\nThere’s no silver bullet when it comes to cybersecurity, but there are defensive steps SMB security leaders can take to affordably mitigate risk and return their focus to what matters most: their businesses.\n\nEstablish endpoint security. An organization’s compromised server usually stems from a compromised endpoint. An endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution that continually monitors all the endpoints and end-user devices can help detect and respond to cyber threats, such as ransomware. Train employees. Being vigilant about alerting employees to new threats and what to look for, coupled with regular training and knowledge testing, can prevent security breaches from occurring altogether. After all, one click on the wrong link can compromise an entire system. Outsource security services to service providers. With limited people and budget, consider outsourcing services to service providers. For example, if security teams want to deploy a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solution, a remote access solution, software-defined perimeter (SDP), secure access service edge (SASE) or security service edge (SSE) control — don’t do this alone. A trusted and experienced third party can help security teams avoid configuration mistakes or overlook some of the key features. Encrypt. Encrypting the most valuable SMB data will make it unreadable to unauthorized users. It can only be deciphered with an encryption key, in the event that data is compromised. Many small businesses look to full-disk encryption, obtained through built-in programs or third parties.\n\nSmall changes make a big difference\n\nThere is always room for improvement. For SMB security, starting small can go a long way in protecting data and the company against ransomware and other cyber threats. With workforce transforming for good, now is the time to make a few adjustments to improve SMB security.\n\nThis article originally ran in Today’s Cybersecurity Leader, a monthly cybersecurity-focused eNewsletter for security end users, brought to you by Security magazine.

#   'text': 'The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday released draft guidance on cybersecurity considerations for medical devicemakers submitting materials for premarket review, a step toward updating guidance released seven years ago.\n\nThe proposal, which replaces an earlier draft the FDA released in 2018, would add expectations related to software development and transparency for medical devices that incorporate software. The FDA is seeking feedback from the public on the proposal.\n\nOnce finalized, the new guidance would replace premarket guidance for medical device cybersecurity last updated in 2014.\n\n"Given the rapidly evolving device cybersecurity landscape, FDA is issuing this draft guidance … to further emphasize the importance of ensuring that devices are designed securely, are designed to be capable of mitigating emerging cybersecurity risks throughout the total product life cycle, and to clearly outline FDA\'s recommendations for premarket submission content to address cybersecurity concerns, including device labeling," the FDA said in its notice in the Federal Register.\n\nThe FDA\'s premarket guidances set expectations for how device manufacturers should design and label products—as well as what documentation they should provide on their design and development work—when submitting information to the agency for premarket review to ensure they meet the agency\'s standards.\n\nThe FDA last released postmarket guidance for managing medical device cybersecurity in 2016.\n\nThe latest draft guidance recommends devicemakers adopt a "secure product framework"—a set of software development practices that prioritize security—to identify and reduce vulnerabilities throughout the product development lifecycle. That includes assessing risks as new cybersecurity threats are discovered after a product\'s been released.\n\nThe guidance also would set recommendations on what cybersecurity documentation devicemakers should submit with applications for investigational device exemptions in clinical trials.\n\nIt also recommends creating a "software bill of materials" for each medical device, building on its 2018 predecessor\'s recommendation for a "cybersecurity bill of materials." A software bill of materials would document all software components in a device, including proprietary software developed by the manufacturer and third-party commercial and open-source software.\n\nThe federal government has published 110 advisories on medical device vulnerabilities disclosed by medical device manufacturers since the FDA released its 2016 post-market guidance, according to data compiled by cybersecurity company MedCrypt and released last month.\n\nSuch vulnerabilities can be dangerous for hospitals and patients, since medical devices connected to the internet or internal hospital networks can be hacked, be disrupted during the course of a ransomware attack or provide a window for cybercriminals to enter a hospital\'s broader network and steal data, according to cybersecurity experts. Cyberattacks can disrupt medical care by delaying procedures or forcing patient diversions.\n\nThe FDA\'s new proposal on premarket submissions highlighted the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack that infected computers and devices worldwide—including some radiology equipment—as an example of a cyberattack that affected hospitals and medical devices.\n\n"Cybersecurity incidents have rendered medical devices and hospital networks inoperable, disrupting the delivery of patient care across healthcare facilities in the U.S. and globally," the draft guidance stated. "Such cyber attacks and exploits may lead to patient harm as a result of clinical hazards, such as delay in diagnoses and/or treatment."\n\nThe FDA is accepting feedback on the draft guidance through July 7, after which the agency said it will begin work on a final version.',

#  {'title': 'Government-targeted DDoS attacks surge by over 1,800% in 2021, report says',
#   'text': 'BROOKLYN, N.Y.—The volume of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks -cyberattacks with a goal to make an online website unavailable by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic - per customer aimed at the government sector soared by over 1,881% in 2021 compared to 2020’s figures, according to data presented by Atlas VPN.\n\nThe data also revealed that the actual attack events decreased by 70%, suggesting fewer but more severe DDoS attacks aimed at the sector.\n\nAccording to Atlas VPN, governments worldwide nowadays face the challenge of protecting their cyberspace in addition to their physical borders. Online presence creates an additional attack surface that can be used in coordinated attacks, such as DDoS attacks.\n\nMalicious actors use DDoS attacks to disrupt government communication and limit information in an effort to decapitate governments. DDoS attacks are also used by hacktivists as part of political protests.\n\n"DDoS attacks are often used as a tool in a cyber warfare to disrupt governments by rendering their online resources unavailable," said Ruta Cizinauskaite, cybersecurity researcher and writer at Atlas VPN. "Hacktivists also use DDoS attacks as part of political protests."\n\nThe figures are based on Radware\'s 2021-2022 Global Threat Analysis Report. The report reviews the year\'s most important cybersecurity events and provides detailed insights into the attack activity of 2021.\n\nDDoS attacks were not limited to the government sector last year, the data showed. The volume of DDoS attacks per customer aimed at the retail industry skyrocketed by 6,288%. Next up was the healthcare sector, which experienced a 260% growth in DDoS attack volume per customer.\n\nThe research and education sector occupies fourth place on the list with a 62% rise in DDoS attack volume in 2021, followed by online commerce and gaming with 41%. Meanwhile, the technology sector saw a 36% increase in DDoS attack volume per customer last year.\n\nWhile the volume of DDoS attacks grew across most industries last year, finance and telecom sectors experienced a decrease. DDoS attack volume plummeted by 34% and 58%, respectively, across the two industries. Overall, the average attack volume per customer rose by 26%.\n\nGovernment sector more prepared to mitigate DDoS attack risks\n\nDespite rising DDoS attacks volume, the government sector handles cyberattacks more effectively than before, according to Atlas VPN.\n\nIn 2021, the government sector mitigated more than 10 times the volume of attacks compared to 2020. In 2020, the blocked volume of DDoS attacks aimed at the sector stood at 1.22%. Meanwhile, in 2021 the number rose by 12.08% to 13.3%, making the government the top third sector with the highest volume of blocked DDoS attacks in 2021.\n\nHowever, the retail industry had the largest spike in mitigated DDoS attack volume and the second biggest volume of blocked attacks last year. In 2021, the volume increased by 20.89% from 0.61% to 21.5%.\n\nIn addition to government and retail, the volume of blocked DDoS attacks aimed at the healthcare industry grew by 5.98%, from 6.12% in 2020 to 12.1% in 2021.\n\nThe rest of the top attacked industries experienced a decrease in the volume of blocked DDoS attacks last year compared to the year before. Telecom saw a 17.93% plunge from 23.4% in 2020 to 5.47% in 2021, and finance had a 10.81% decline from 17% to 6.19%. Meanwhile, online commerce and gaming had a 6.4% fall from 28.7% to 22.3%. However, even with the drop, the sector experienced the highest volume of DDoS attacks out of all in 2021.\n\nOther industries with declining DDoS attack volume include technology with a 2.8% drop and research and education with a 0.63% decrease.',

#  {'title': 'Suspected Russian hackers target Nigerian websites, hit Bet9ja',
#   'text': 'Suspected Russian hackers have begun to target Nigerian websites, with Bet9ja falling as their first victim.\n\nThis is coming after the United States said it secretly removed malware from computer networks around the world in recent weeks, in its bid to pre-empt Russian cyber attacks.\n\nThe US said the move was necessary because of Russia’s plan to attack American critical infrastructure. It said the malware it removed enabled Russians to create ‘botnets’ — networks of private computers that are infected with malicious software and controlled by the G.R.U., the intelligence arm of the Russian military.\n\nBet9ja first announced that it was having issues with its website on Wednesday on its verified Twitter handle. According to the company, its customers were not able to login into their accounts.\n\nIt said, “We are currently experiencing an issue with our website. This means you may not be able to log in.\n\n“We take this matter very seriously and our IT team is working on it as their number one priority right now.”\n\nHowever, on Thursday, the firm announced that it had become a victim of a cyber-attack. Bet9ja said, “The Bet9ja betting platform, just like so many market-leading global organisations, has recently become a victim of a sophisticated criminal cyber-attack, which is restricting our customers from having access to the platform.\n\n“We are working tirelessly with our IT team, independent forensics, and cybercrime experts to resolve this, we take this matter extremely seriously. Our priority is protecting our customers and you have our assurances that your accounts will not be compromised, and all your funds are safe.\n\n“We apologise for this situation and once back online, we will reward our loyal customers with a truly sensational bonanza of promotions.”\n\nIn a previous post, the firm added that its customer’s funds are secured.\n\nAccording to the Founder, e86 Limited, OluGbenga Odeyemi, Bet9ja’s attack is likely to become commonplace with other companies if proactive steps are not taken,\n\nHe said, “Yes, we are likely to see more of that. The US government sent out a notice/warning about a week or two ago about impending attacks from Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“Every organisation must beef up their security at this time. If there are things they have been cutting back on, now is the time to fix those things. For organisations that have always kept their infrastructure up to date, this will be a good time to have regular internal checks and thorough penetration testing done on their infrastructure.\n\n“My hope is that organisations won’t find out about attacks on their infrastructure when it’s too late to salvage anything.”\n\nOdeyemi added that Nigerians should be worried about a likely increase in cyber attacks as it is likely to cripple the productivity of organisations.The bank’s Group Managing Director, Kennedy Uzoka, said the firm’s business outside Nigeria had been doing well, as he specifically noted that its branch in the United Kingdom had witnessed remarkable expansion.\n\nHe said, “As from July 2021, UBA UK started making profit, and even to date, they are still doing well, and the same can be said for many of our African subsidiaries.\n\n“The truth is that we are driven by the opportunities and potential in each of the geographies that we invested in, and we are happy with what we have achieved so far.”\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

#  {'title': 'Akamai Data Reveals Increase in Cyber Attacks Driven by Online Holiday Shopping',
#   'text': 'Singapore, April 8 (ANI/PRNewswire): Akamai Technologies, Inc., the world\'s most trusted solution to power and protect digital experiences, released today new data detailing the prevalence of malicious botnet attacks during the holiday season in Asia.\n\nThat data found a 15 per cent increase in cyberattacks in China over the Lunar New Year in February 2022, showing that cybercriminals are actively trying to take advantage of customers during high-traffic moments.\n\nAlso Read | Holy Week 2022 Calendar With Full Dates: From Palm Sunday to Good Friday to Easter; Check Schedule, Traditions and Meaning of All the Days of Christian Passion Week.\n\nThe uptick in attacks continues a trend that began with Singles Day, the Chinese eCommerce festival, in November 2021, during which botnet attacks tripled. Despite gradually declining after, attack traffic remained relatively high through the end of the year before peaking again with the buildup of retail traffic during the Lunar New Year. This year, the Lunar New Year coincided with the start of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, further boosting online sales and making the period more attractive for attackers.\n\nMalicious actors operate year-round, but the high volume of traffic during holiday periods allows them to mask their attacks more easily. Additionally, customers are more likely to update their online shopping profiles with up-to-date credit card information and credentials during this period, providing a more lucrative target for attackers.\n\nAlso Read | Weather Forecast: Severe Heatwave Conditions to Grip Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan; Heavy Rainfall Spell Likely Over Arunachal Pradesh During Next 5 Days.\n\nAs traffic increases, attackers increase the volume of their attacks which include scraping data, draining customer accounts, damaging site functionality and holding encrypted data ransom - at massive cost to a business.\n\n"Holidays represent a huge opportunity for attackers thanks to increased online activity and security teams stretched thin," said Dr Boaz Gelbord, Akamai\'s Chief Security Officer. "APAC presents a particularly enticing opportunity for successful cyberattacks because the sheer volume of traffic gives attackers the opportunity to gain foothold more easily and operate freely without timely mitigation. Akamai works with customers to develop strategies that take into account complex attack patterns and behaviors of malicious bots during the holidays and beyond to protect brands and customer loyalty."\n\nIn Japan, Akamai research measured a 150 percent increase in malicious botnet activity in the Japanese retail sector around the Gregorian New Year in early January 2022. The attacks persisted for a number of weeks following the holiday in a nearly identical attack pattern to that observed in China.\n\nWhile a similar surge occurs during the high-traffic seen at the end-of-year holidays in EMEA and the US-China and Japan present a particularly enticing opportunity for successful cyberattacks because of the sheer volume in traffic: Retailers and eCommerce here serve some of the largest populations in the world.\n\nAkamai researchers monitored and analyzed underlying malicious botnets attack data throughout APAC during the holiday period, from late 2021 to early 2022. Akamai tracks benign and malicious bots as a proportion of internet traffic year-round to uncover patterns in botnet activity that can provide security teams with actionable data to incorporate into their defense.\n\nAkamai powers and protects life online.

#  {'title': 'US Cyber Command reinforces Ukraine and allies amid Russian onslaught',
#   'text': 'WASHINGTON — U.S. Cyber Command has played a pivotal role in shielding networks and critical infrastructure stateside and abroad in the run up to and during Russia’s attack on Ukraine, its leader told Congress this week.\n\nAlong with tasking teams with identifying cyber vulnerabilities and threats — operations that have since “bolstered the resilience of Ukraine” and others — the command has gleaned and shared intelligence, worked hand-in-glove with U.S. government and industry, and pursued extensive contingency planning, Gen. Paul Nakasone said April 5.\n\n“In conjunction with interagency, private sector and allied partners, we are collaborating to mitigate threats to domestic and overseas systems,” he continued in written testimony provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nIn Ukraine, specifically, Cyber Command has provided remote analytic support and conducted network defense activities, Nakasone testified. The general is also the director of the National Security Agency.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed and Sen. Mazie Hirono on Tuesday applauded Cyber Command’s ongoing efforts and its earlier exposure of Russian plans.\n\n“That was very helpful to enable all of us to be much better prepared for this sudden, terrible war that is happening in the Ukraine,” said Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat.\n\nRussia’s latest invasion of Ukraine, which began in earnest Feb. 24, was preceded by a flurry of cyberattacks. They continue to this day, according to the Ukrainian government, with communications systems and other infrastructure as primary targets.\n\nThe State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine on March 29 declared “cyberwar is underway,” noting “cyberoffenders keep on attempting to cause harm to Ukraine’s information infrastructure or to collect important information.”\n\nRussia’s military and intelligence forces are employing “a range of cyber capabilities, to include espionage, influence and attack units, to support its” physical attacks and its international propaganda campaign, Nakasone said April 5. The current crisis, he added, is not over.\n\nSen. Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, concurred.\n\n“We know Russia’s launching cyberattacks against Ukraine,” she said, “hitting the country’s national telecommunications industry just last week and causing great denial of service and service disruptions.”\n\nThe Pentagon is seeking $11.2 billion for cyber in fiscal year 2023 — a boost of $800 million, or nearly 8%, over the Biden administration’s previous cyber ask. The suggested increase indicates a growing appreciation of cyber as well as the importance of U.S. forces in the digital domain.\n\n“Cybersecurity is national security,” Nakasone told lawmakers.\n\nColin Demarest is a reporter at C4ISRNET, where he covers networks and IT. Colin previously covered the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration — namely nuclear weapons development and Cold War cleanup — for a daily newspaper in South Carolina.',

#  {'title': 'BlackCat Ransomware Targets Industrial Companies',
#   'text': 'A data theft tool used by the ransomware group tracked as BlackCat, ALPHV and Noberus, suggests that the cybercriminals are increasingly interested in targeting industrial organizations.\n\nThe BlackCat ransomware group, which operates under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, emerged in November 2021 and has since targeted organizations worldwide, including many in the United States.\n\nSeveral cybersecurity firms have found links between BlackCat and the BlackMatter and DarkSide ransomware operations. It appears that the BlackCat team consists of various RaaS group affiliates, including BlackMatter, rather than being a rebranding of BlackMatter.\n\nIn a blog post published on Thursday, Kaspersky also provided information on the connection between BlackMatter and BlackCat, focusing on a data exfiltration tool called Fendr and ExMatter.\n\nFendr was described by Symantec last year as a custom data exfiltration tool that enabled BlackMatter operators to easily steal data of value from compromised systems. The tool, previously seen only in BlackMatter attacks, is designed to collect specific file types and upload them to the cybercriminals’ servers before file-encrypting ransomware is deployed. The stolen data can then be used to pressure the victim into paying up.\n\nIn a recent BlackCat attack on an oil, gas, mining and construction firm in South America, the hackers deployed a version of the Fendr tool. However, compared to the tool spotted in BlackMatter attacks, this one had targeted some additional file types, specifically ones that are typically found in industrial environments.\n\n“These additional file extensions are used in industrial design applications, like CAD drawings and some databases, as well as RDP configuration settings, making the tool more customized towards the industrial environments that we see being targeted by this group,” Kaspersky explained.\n\n[ READ: \u200b\u200bEurope Warned About Cyber Threat to Industrial Infrastructure ]\n\nThe fact that a ransomware gang is interested in industrial companies is not surprising, and both governments and cybersecurity firms have been warning organizations that ransomware poses an increasing threat to industrial systems.\n\nIn a report published in February, industrial cybersecurity firm Claroty said ransomware often hits industrial control systems (ICS) or other operational technology (OT) environments, and impact is often significant.\n\nRelated: Ransomware Gang Leaks Files Stolen From Industrial Giant Parker Hannifin\n\nRelated: \u200b\u200bThousands of Industrial Firms Targeted in Attacks Using Short-Lived Malware\n\nRelated: Many Ransomware Attacks on OT Organizations Involved Ryuk',

#  {'title': 'Healthcare and the Other CIA',
#   'text': 'For IT professionals, the acronym “CIA” refers to the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of information, not the Central Intelligence Agency. However, given the current threat level to data security, IT teams may wish they could get a little help from people with intelligence community tradecraft experience.\n\nHealthcare has become a prime target for what amounts to data espionage. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there were 618 breaches and attacks serious enough to affect at least 500 people in 2021, and there’s no reason to think 2022 will be any better.\n\nTwo specific types of exploits are being seen with disturbing frequency. The first is out-and-out theft of patient records for financial gain. A typical example is the breach of a third-party system from Dental Care Alliance. This exploit impacted more than 1 million patients,10% of which had their bank account numbers stolen.\n\nThe second type of exploit is ransomware, which is even more devastating, because inability to access patient data can put their lives at risk. There are plenty of statistics available about the increasing number of ransomware attacks on hospitals and healthcare systems in general, but the most frightening development is the rise of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). Anyone reading this article could log on to the dark web and easily obtain ransomware capabilities.\n\nMore sophisticated RaaS systems are priced in the thousands of dollars, but many of them come with commercial-style features like 24/7 technical support. And the rewards of a successful attack can be huge. In 2021, IBM reported the average cost of a cyberattack to a healthcare system to be $4.62 million per incident, much of which went into attackers’ pockets.\n\nTo sum up, healthcare systems are attractive targets and the means to attack them are more available than ever.\n\nFortunately, effective defenses do exist. Many of them work quite well, but they all come with pluses and minuses. Here’s a summary:\n\n● Training: When employees are trained to avoid risky behavior, such as clicking on links in an email from an unknown source, the threat of attack is reduced. However, human error is a fact of life, and no amount of training can ensure employees will never make a mistake.\n\n● Upgrades: Software updates often include important security improvements along with other features. However, upgrades can be complicated to install, require testing, and are notorious for crashing systems. Recently, the installation of a recommended update from an international software vendor resulted in a major incident that took down 20 National Health Service IT systems in the UK.\n\n● Cybersecurity software: A wide (and sometimes confusing) variety of applications are available to detect and mitigate cyber attacks, and in general they work. Unfortunately, they are often beyond the budget of healthcare organizations. They sometimes have steep learning curves and are typically incompatible with one another. Also, because the cybercrime community is constantly evolving new forms of attack, these applications can quickly become outdated.\n\n● Best Practices: Adopting best practices such as end-to-end encryption, role-based access and least-privileged access controls, mandatory password updates and the like all contribute to data security. However, all of these require a significant commitment of resources for administration, and can introduce significant friction into the system.\n\nRecently, a new approach to data security has emerged that should be extremely attractive to health care organizations for its low cost, ease of use and effectiveness: obfuscation, sometimes referred to as security through obscurity. In simple terms, obfuscation technology creates a path to data and applications residing in commercial clouds that cannot be traced. Offered as a service, obfuscation lets users interact with data (or one another) with one click inside their familiar browser.\n\nObfuscation is becoming more and more relevant to healthcare organizations because of their increasing adoption of cloud technology. In one recent survey, 60 percent of IT executives in healthcare said they were migrating to the cloud by adopting a hybrid approach, and 82 percent relied on the cloud in some way or another. Obfuscation can make healthcare data in commercial or private clouds invisible.\n\nThe battle between the attackers and defenders of data, in healthcare and everywhere else, is bound to continue. As the defenses become stronger and more robust, the weapons of attack will continually improve. Obfuscation provides a means of avoiding this endless battle altogether by simply hiding.',

#   'text': 'COLUMBIA — Richland County will consider spending millions of federal COVID-19 relief dollars on new emergency vehicles and computer equipment to protect the county against cyber attacks.\n\nThe county could spend several million dollars of its federal allocation to purchase an armored vehicle and gunshot-detection software for the Richland County Sheriff\'s Department, new emergency vehicles for first responders and for the cost of flights and equipment necessary to produce new countywide aerial maps and related software.\n\nOf the roughly $80 million the county will receive from the American Rescue Plan Act, about $20 million has already been committed. The county decided to use some of the money for security upgrades at Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center, heating and air systems for county buildings, gift cards to pass out as vaccine incentives and bonus pay for employees who worked during the pandemic, among other costs.\n\nCounty policymakers are now considering a batch of requests that would total another $50 million.\n\nThose include a $35 million project to build a family services center for the S.C. Department of Social Services in the county-owned portions of Columbia Place Mall, a project County Council approved pursuing with the federal money in 2021.\n\nThe 5th Circuit Solicitor\'s Office, which prosecutes criminal cases in Richland and Kershaw counties, has asked for $1.2 million toward a new case management system.\n\nAnd there\'s a list compiled by county administrators that includes the emergency vehicles and computer equipment.\n\nA three-person committee chaired by County Councilwoman Gretchen Barron is considering the spending proposals, which would ultimately be approved by the full County Council. Under federal guidelines, the American Rescue Plan funding has to be allocated for specific uses by 2024 and spent by 2026.\n\n"Let\'s see what we have an appetite for, what we don\'t, and then take this one step further," Barron said during a committee meeting April 6. "Because we\'re not talking about $5 here, we\'re talking about $60 million. And we want to make sure that we are definitely doing the best that we can for the citizens of Richland County."\n\nAmong the projects county leaders want considered are:\n\n$6.3 million for 10 new ambulances, two firetrucks, defibrillators, radios and computer equipment for emergency services.\n\n$4.2 million that would include replacing IT equipment and phones throughout the county, upgrading equipment to allow for remote meetings, implementing upgraded firewalls, servers and networks and redesigning the county\'s website.\n\n$2 million to the sheriff\'s department for startup costs and an initial three-year contract with ShotSpotter, a technology service already used by Columbia Police Department that would detect unreported gunshots in unincorporated areas of the county.\n\n$991,000 for the assessor\'s office to pay for flights during the next three years to produce advanced aerial property images.\n\n$988,000 for additional sets of firefighting bunker gear.\n\n$505,000 to the county\'s IT department for new software, aerial maps and drone equipment\n\n$305,000 for an armored vehicle the sheriff\'s department says could be employed during active-shooter situations, natural disasters and other emergencies.\n\n$140,000 for maintenance to the sheriff\'s department Cessna airplane.\n\nOther county needs, such as major utilities projects and a new emergency operations center, weren\'t included in the requests from the COVID-19 money, County Administrator Leonard Brown noted.\n\nCounty officials believe they can find funding for those projects elsewhere, such as the taxpayer dollars coming via the infrastructure bill passed by Congress in November, Brown said.\n\nRichland County Sheriff Leon Lott said the agency already has an armored vehicle from a federal military surplus program that allows officers cover when necessary but said the requested vehicle — a Lenco BearCat with four-wheel drive and other specialized upgrades — would be more tailored to officers\' needs.\n\nAs evidence of the vehicle\'s effectiveness, he pointed to a shooting in Florence in 2018 that killed two law enforcement officers and wounded several others after a man opened fire as police arrived to serve a warrant. Medics were pinned down by gunfire and unable to get to wounded officers until an armored vehicle arrived, said Lott, whose agency investigated the shooting.\n\n"It\'s not something that we would use daily," Lott said. "But it\'s something that if we need it, it\'s better to have it available than need it and not have it."\n\nLott\'s agency already has access to the city of Columbia\'s ShotSpotter information, Lott said. The sheriff\'s department proposal would expand the reach regionally and be concentrated in areas of the county where shootings are known to be more common, the sheriff said.',

#  {'title': 'Securing Controls with Defense in Depth',
#   'text': "This is the second installment in the new Peer-to-Peer FAQ series of content from Automation World. This series focuses on explaining the most common and trending technologies in the world of industrial automation.\n\nThe first article in this series focused on machine vision and smart instrument sensors and how their data can be analyzed using artificial intelligence to improve production operations (access this first installment online at awgo.to/1382). Each installment in this Peer-to-Peer FAQ series will highlight succinct yet detailed explanations of each technology, followed by insights from end users and integrators about their selection, implementation, and use.\n\nThis article focuses on cybersecurity, particularly the defense-in-depth approach that has proven to be a successful method of protecting industrial control systems and restoring their operation after a cyber-attack.\n\nDefense-in-depth explained\n\nThe use of multiple cybersecurity protections is the key to a defense-in-depth approach to ensure industrial networks remain as secure as possible.\n\nPerimeter-based cybersecurity strategies that employ tools such as firewalls and border routers or that separate plant-floor intranet networks from internet-connected enterprise networks using an industrial demilitarized zone were once recommended as a high-level security tactic to ensure one's information and assets were protected.\n\nHowever, on their own, these tools are no longer a viable approach in a world where businesses may develop and deploy applications in corporate data centers, private and public clouds, or even leverage software-as-a-service models that require them to maintain a connection to the broader internet. While these technologies drive many aspects of digital transformation, they also create new vectors through which malicious actors can enter a network. Moreover, growing numbers of cybercriminals are using phishing or other means to steal employee credentials. In these cases, networks need to be configured to detect external incursions and identify unusual internal activity.\n\nWhen a defense-in-depth strategy is properly deployed, even if a bad actor gains access to the network, security protocols exist to prevent them from causing extensive harm. Often, these strategies are applied not only to IT systems, but physical infrastructure and organizational processes as well.\n\nThough expert advice on what constitutes defense-in-depth can vary, following are explanations of the key tools and techniques commonly used to establish a defense-in-depth cybersecurity strategy for an industrial control system.\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork perimeter security\n\nWhile no longer adequate as a stand-alone method of protection, perimeter-based security mechanisms still play an important role in a defense-in-depth strategy. Tried-and-true perimeter-based methods include firewalls, VPNs (virtual private networks), and VLANs (virtual local area networks).\n\nFirewalls scan packets entering a network for malicious code that has been identified as an established threat and flags them as security risks when appropriate.\n\nVPNs mask user data by routing all communications through an encrypted private server, rather than a public internet service provider, allowing users to remotely connect to a network via a secure tunnel. This can be used by someone within a plant who wants to send local data to an enterprise network, or someone outside of a plant who needs to connect to an internal industrial control system safely.\n\nVLANs are private virtual networks confined to a single plant. They allow a single physical LAN to be partitioned into several smaller units so that industrial automation systems that engage in functions such as real-time control can be separated from internal IT systems used for email or other tasks that require connection to the broader internet.\n\nAlthough vital as a first line of defense, perimeter strategies can be bypassed by a dedicated hacker. Phishing attempts, physical CDs, USB sticks, or other data carrying hardware devices, as well as blind spots in one's firewall software, can all lead to breaches. Because of this, it's important to employ additional cybersecurity tools.\n\nEndpoint security\n\nThe practice of securing entry points to a network is referred to as endpoint security. Because any Internet of Things device connected to a network can serve as an entry point, an Industry 4.0 environment may contain hundreds or even thousands of vulnerabilities.\n\nEndpoint security relies on software packages known as EPPs (endpoint protection platforms), which sometimes include an EDR (endpoint detection and response) component as well. EPPs work by examining files as they enter a network and checking them against a cloud database containing a library of threat information. This allows end users to outsource the cost and burden of storing such large libraries of information on site. In addition, it enables threat libraries to be continually updated based on activity from many different sites.\n\nEDRs augment the EPP by providing a machine-learning algorithm for classifying new threats in realtime. When an EDR is used, abnormal file signatures that may represent a threat can be identified even if no prior record of a similar incursion is contained within the EPP's library. The EDR achieves this by studying the baseline behaviors and tactics common to all known cyber-attacks and scanning for them routinely. This allows new incursions to be detected, even if minor details such as IP addresses, registry keys, and domain numbers vary.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatch management tools\n\nPatch management is the process of using regular scans and software updates to fix bugs, add new features, or address newly discovered vulnerabilities in an application, system, or network. While this is a well established practice in IT, it is slightly more challenging when applied to operations technology (OT). This is due to a combination of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\nA lack of automatic inventory monitoring for end systems, making it difficult to determine which assets need updates and when;\n\nDifficulty in tracking patch releases for all systems and applications, particularly when working in a multi-vendor environment; and\n\nThe time-consuming nature of deploying patches on each individual device, confirming that the updates are working as intended, and documenting the changes.\n\nWith the number of cyberattacks originating from within the OT environment growing, patch management procedures must be applied to connected physical assets. Fortunately, patch management can be automated through the deployment of a centralized patch management server or dedicated patch management tool, which can ease the process of detecting missing patches, installing updates, and documenting the changes for large quantities of devices. However, such automated procedures will need to be managed by OT to ensure occurrence at a time that will not impact production.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntrusion detection and prevention tools\n\nIDS (intrusion detection systems) and IPS (intrusion prevention systems) are like EPP and EDR, with the caveat that rather than merely scanning for malicious files, IDS and IPS track user activity more broadly. This makes them more effective for detecting social engineering attempts that manipulate users into revealing sensitive information.\n\nAn IDS works by monitoring user behavior to detect malicious intent, scanning processes when patterns known to be harmful are recognized, and monitoring changes to system settings and configurations. If suspicious activity, a security policy violation, or an inappropriate change to configuration is detected, the IPS takes over. An IPS can drop malicious packets, block offending IP addresses, and kick unwanted users off a network. Whenever one of these actions is performed, the IPS alerts security personnel.\n\nUser identity and access management\n\nThe goal of identity and access management (IAM) is to grant users access to assets and devices to which they have been pre-approved. This ensures that only trained and vetted users engage with vulnerable or mission-critical applications and systems. Cybersecurity managers can use IAM to limit and control access to sensitive information. A few of the most common are IAM framework components are:\n\nPrivileged Account Management: This refers to the management and auditing of data accessed by user accounts based on a set of privileges that have been granted to them. Simply put, privileged account management allows administrators to create a repository of users which it can assign and remove privileges from based on their role within an organization.\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication: When information beyond a username and password is required to log in, multi-factor authentication is being used. As an example, after inputting their username and password, a user may be required to enter a code sent via SMS to their smartphone or provide biometric data, such as a fingerprint scan.\n\nRisk-Based Authentication: When risk-based authentication is used, a system can dynamically adjust the authentication requirements based on the user's situation at the moment the authentication is being attempted. For instance, if a user attempts to access a remote system from a geographic location or IP address that has not previously been associated with them, a risk-based authentication mechanism could require them to confirm their identity by requesting additional information.\n\nContext-Aware Network Access Control: Like risk-based authentication, context aware network access control is a policy-based method whereby users are granted or denied access to a network based on the context in which they are seeking access. Typical context aspects include user identity, location, device security status, and IP address. Rather than requiring additional authentication steps when a user makes an unusual log in attempt, context aware network access control blocks them entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd user and integrator attack experience\n\nAs predicted years ago when news of cyberattacks on large manufacturers began to surface, cyber intrusions have become more widespread across industry, regardless of size of operation or industry vertical.\n\nSurvey data of Automation World readers in both the end user and system integrator sectors indicate a significant number of system breaches. More than a third of end users (36%) report having experienced a cybersecurity breach at their company. Looking at this question more granularly among system integrator respondents shows that 89% of integrators report up to 50% of their customers having experienced a cyber breach.\n\nBoth end users and integrators note that the predominant form of attack on industrial companies tends to be malware, such as ransomware, spyware, worms, trojans, and other viruses. Beyond these top factors, the response between end users and integrators diverges a bit.\n\nBreach of remote access and phishing were reported as the next most often experienced cyber-attack (each being noted by 25% of end user respondents). Integrators, also noted breach of remote access and phishing, but at a higher rate than end users—38% and 50%, respectively. Only 13% of end users noted experience with password attacks, but 50% of integrators cited experience with this at customer sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practices to mitigate ongoing issues\n\nWhen asked about their biggest concerns when it comes to cybersecurity, end users and integrators both cited lasting problems after recovery from an incursion. Specific concerns in this area include:\n\nLoss of information;\n\nSystem access denials;\n\nInability to access files; and\n\nOngoing interruptions to production.\n\nOngoing issues have been particularly difficult with ransomware attacks. Rubrik, a cloud data management company, notes the following best practices to apply to any cyber breach recovery scenario:\n\nRecover safely: Only begin recovery operations after the ransomware has been neutralized. This may mean that data needs to be recovered in isolation or to new systems. Restoring systems or data before the ransomware has been neutralized may result in the system/data being attacked again. If the ransomware cannot be isolated and neutralized in a timely manner, the alternative is to recover where systems cannot be reinfected.\n\nDecrypt data: Recovery may not be necessary if there is a decryptor for the ransomware strain that was identified. When possible, decrypt existing data to prevent data loss. Decryption should be done in a safe environment. If the ransomware cannot be neutralized, decryption in isolation may be required.\n\nIsolated recovery: Because ransomware attacks can be so pervasive that recovering back to original locations will only result in secondary attacks, recovering to an isolated environment where the ransomware did not have access is the best prevention against a secondary attack. This requires advance identification and testing of an isolated environment for use during the recovery phase.\n\nPrioritized recovery: Recovery should be based on prioritization of applications and lines of business. Ensure that foundational services required for basic functionality, such as DNS, DHCP, and authentication are running or restored first. Without these, the recovered systems may not function properly.\n\nAutomation: Automated recovery via tools such as application programming interfaces (APIs) and software development kits (SDKs) will speed up recovery times. Examples of where automation can be particularly helpful include recovery of network-attached storage systems (file level data storage server connected to a computer network to provide access to a group of clients) with tens or hundreds of shares, recovering complete virtual environments with hundreds or thousands of virtual machines, database servers with many databases, and file sets across multiple servers.\n\nApplication of defense-in-depth\n\nFor years now, industrial cybersecurity experts have stressed the importance of the defense-in-depth strategy. Fortunately, this message has not been ignored by industry. Our research shows that 77% of end users and 70% of integrators employ the defense-in-depth approach to cybersecurity, with 44% of end users and 50% of integrators having used the approach for five years or more.\n\nAnti-virus software, firewalls/VPNs, user identity authentication, and privileged access protection are the top four technologies deployed by both integrators and end users in their defense-in-depth approach. Beyond these top four technologies, however, further defense-in-depth technology applications differ between end users and integrators. Though both end users and integrators cite intrusion/anomaly detection and patch management tools as the next two most widely used technologies, 56% of end users use patch management tools and 50% use intrusion/anomaly detection. However, only 33% of integrators use intrusion/anomaly detection and 17% use patch management tools as part of their defense-in-depth approach.\n\nOther defense-in-depth approaches noted by end users include deep network traffic visibility and the use of a data diode between critical infrastructure and the business LAN (local area network). Data diodes are communication devices that only allow one-way data transfer between source and destination networks.",

#   'text': 'Fast-changing privacy and data security risks and accompanying legal obligations can challenge many organizations and their legal counsel.\n\nThroughout 2021, issues such as sophisticated cyberattacks and evolving state data privacy laws dominated the headlines. Further, cross-border data transfers between the European Union and the United States still lack a clear, streamlined mechanism while national authorities continue to negotiate an EU-US Privacy Shield replacement, although recent statements show promise.\n\nThe past year also showcased the ongoing cyber risks of remote and hybrid work environments and the rise of double-extortion ransomware attacks, which occur when hackers demand payment for decryption keys with (too often false) promises not to disclose compromised data.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nIn December 2021, we saw another cybersecurity development with news of a serious vulnerability in Log4j, a widely used, open-source logging library. The US Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency offered its guidance on applying available patches. However, the high-risk exploit undoubtedly spurred attacks on vulnerable companies’ networks, prompting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue a January 2022 advisory reminding companies that its actively enforced reasonable data security measures standard requires them to appropriately patch their software.\n\n2021 privacy & data security trends\n\nTo minimize exposure, organizations and their counsel must keep up with the dynamic and increasing legal obligations that govern privacy and data security, understand how they apply, monitor cyber risks and attack trends, and manage compliance.\n\nFederal and state legislation, regulation & enforcement — At the federal level last year, the FTC made significant updates to its Safeguards Rule (16 C.F.R. §§ 314.1 to 314.6) and issued a policy statement that arguably expands the application of its Health Breach Notification Rule.\n\nFurther, federal regulators — including the FTC, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a growing set of other agencies — issued guidance and took actions against organizations with alleged privacy and cybersecurity lapses.\n\nThe US Congress again failed to pass comprehensive data privacy legislation, still disagreeing on the extent of federal preemption of state laws and the inclusion of a private right of action. In that absence, many states showed their willingness to regulate consumer data privacy themselves.\n\nFor example, the California Attorney General issued updated regulations under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), banning so-called “dark patterns” that delay or obscure consumers from opting out of the sale of personal information, among other changes. The California Privacy Protection Agency, newly formed in 2021 under the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), began its rulemaking process.\n\nAlso, Virginia and Colorado joined the club, with Virginia enacting its Consumer Data Protection Act that goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2023, and Colorado enacting its own Privacy Act that becomes effective on July 1, 2023. Other states enacted or updated their data breach notification, genetic information privacy, and other data privacy and cybersecurity-related laws, including new laws from Connecticut and Utah that incentivize cybersecurity program adoption.\n\nPrivate litigation — Private litigation continued to play a crucial role in privacy and data security enforcement as well, with notable actions last year arising from data breaches, other data privacy lapses, robocalling allegations, and issues under state-specific biometric laws, most notably Illinois’s Biometric Information Privacy Act.\n\nThe US Supreme Court also issued several noteworthy data privacy-related decisions in 2021, further restricting plaintiffs’ abilities to bring certain cases in federal court, limiting the FTC’s enforcement powers, and narrowly interpreting key provisions under both the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\n\nInternational developments likely to affect multinationals — The global momentum for enacting and enforcing comprehensive data protection laws and regulations continued in 2021, with new or updated laws likely to affect multinationals in a variety of jurisdictions, including Québec, China, the British Virgin Islands, El Salvador, Rwanda, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Uganda, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn the wake of the European Court of Justice decision in 2020 to invalidate the EU-US Privacy Shield, EU data protection authorities continued to act, including issuing new standard contractual clauses under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and offering further guidance. The European Commission adopted adequacy decisions regarding the UK in late June, allowing personal data to continue to flow freely from the EU to the UK, post-Brexit.\n\nIssues likely to garner more attention in 2022\n\nData privacy compliance will remain a priority and challenge for many organizations. Focus is on the GDPR, CCPA, and preparation for various compliance dates under new or updated state laws and regulations. Compliance professionals should be aware that while some state provisions do not go into effect until 2023, the CPRA contains a longer look-back requirement for consumer access requests, making compliance attention now a smart move.\n\nEarly 2022 activities already show that state legislatures will keep filling the gap left by the lack of federal data privacy regulation, with varying approaches likely to increase the burden of an already complex compliance regime.\n\nSome other trends in this area to watch include:\n\nConsumers’ heightened privacy expectations, especially for sensitive financial, genetic, health, and location data. The FTC’s evolving priorities, including closer scrutiny of the relationship between market power and consumer data privacy harm. The continued and increasingly global attention on cross-border data transfers. Organizations’ ongoing need to manage their own and supply chain cyber-risks, including the growth of public/private cyber information sharing programs. Cybercriminals’ increased targeting of digital assets such as non-fungible tokens and cryptocurrency holdings, forcing a keener security focus on organizations’ digital strategies.\n\n\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

#  {'title': 'Chinese hackers targeted 7 Indian power hubs, govt says ops failed',
#   'text': 'Cyber attackers linked to the Chinese military likely broke into the networks of seven power grid hubs in north India, an American cybersecurity research group said on Thursday, with at least some of the targeting being confirmed by a minister who said the attempts were not successful.\n\n{{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}\n\nThe incident is the latest in a string of cyber espionage attributed to groups based in China, with past attacks targeting critical infrastructure such as power plants, and private organisations in sensitive sectors like defence and finance.\n\n“Two attempts by Chinese hackers were made to target electricity distribution centres near Ladakh but were not successful... We’ve already strengthened our defence system to counter such cyber attacks,” RK Singh, Union minister for Power and new and renewable energy, said to news agency ANI.\n\nHours earlier, US based cyber threat intelligence company Recorded Future released a report saying it had found evidence that “at least seven Indian state load dispatch centres (SLDCs)” and an Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company were targeted by a China-linked group that it has codenamed TAG-38.\n\n{{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}\n\nThis is the third such attempt reported in a little over a year. In March, 2021, Recorded Future released findings of another China-linked cyber espionage campaign that targeted the Indian power grid, attributing the campaign to a group that it calls RedEcho. Later in June, Recorded Future identified RedFoxtrot, a second China-linked, as having targeted Indian telecom companies, government agencies and defence contractors.\n\nOf these, the government confirmed the attacks that were linked to RedEcho at the time.\n\nFollowing the disclosure last year, the Recorded Future report released on Thursday said, there “was a short lull” in the activities of the China-linked adversaries the company was tracking.\n\nBut, “since at least September 2021, we have observed TAG38 intrusions targeting the identified victim organisations” with activity that went on till at least March 2022.\n\n{{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}\n\nThe company said such “prolonged targeting of Indian power grid assets by Chinese state-linked groups” is unlikely to yield any significant economic or traditional intelligence-gathering opportunities. “We believe this targeting is instead likely intended to enable information gathering surrounding critical infrastructure systems or is pre-positioning for future activity,” it added.\n\nCrucially, the report notes that there was no evidence yet that the attackers reached what is known as the industrial control system (ICS) environment. The ICS environment is typically an insulated network layer that houses the systems involved in critical functions – in the most recent case, this function would be electricity routing and load balancing.\n\nThe technical analysis into the new attempt found evidence that the attackers used a malware family called ShadowPad, which has been widely attributed to China-linked cyber operations. Evidence of its use was found in the past two India-focussed activities as well.\n\n{{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}\n\n“We observed longstanding communication between the victim SLDC networks and ShadowPad C2 (command and control) servers, which is very likely indicative of ShadowPad infections within these networks,” a person from Recorded Future’s threat intelligence Insikt Group told HT over email.\n\n“ShadowPad is a modular backdoor that allows an attacker an array of capabilities, including the ability to extract information about the victim machine, execute commands, transfer data, interact with the file system and registry, and deploy new modules to extend functionality (such as keylogging and screen recording),” this person added.\n\nRecorded Future did not identify the exact SLDCs that were targeted but a map of the victim organisation’s in its report suggested these were in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.\n\n{{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}\n\nThe company tied the activity to suspected Chinese actors by finding that the victim networks were communicating with known ShadowPad command-and-control servers and through a unique security certificate that has “multiple links to wider Chinese-sponsored espionage activity”.\n\nThe person quoted above gave new insights into the espionage attempt, saying the attackers had used compromised internet-connected security cameras and surveillance video recorders located in South Korea and Taiwan to route their “command and control” of the intrusion into the Indian targets.\n\n“Essentially, malware present on a victim network is configured to communicate with an external C2 server in order to enable an attacker to send commands and transfer data. In this case, these C2 servers were compromised third-party IP camera/DVR devices under the control of the attacker. This is likely an attempt to make the traffic look benign and also hinder attribution efforts,” the person said.\n\n{{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry official said that the government does not support such activity. “We have taken note of the relevant reports. We have repeatedly reiterated that China firmly opposes and combats any form of hacking in accordance with the law, not to mention that it will not encourage, support or condone hacking attacks,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, alleging the findings were meant to “sow discord” and “throw dirty water on China”.\n\nThe Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert-In) did not respond to HT’s request for comments.\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON',

#  {'title': 'How to build a strong cyber defence for your construction business',
#   'text': 'Rick Jones, CEO, DigitalXRAID, looks at how and why a cyberattack could cripple a construction business and discusses the threat ransomware poses to construction, why companies should heed the latest NCSC advice and how the industry can build a strong cyber defence\n\nThe threat of cyberattacks continues to grow in all industries and construction is no exception. Recent research based on ransomware data released by hackers shows construction as the worst-hit industry in 2021. Though they may not traditionally be seen as a major target for cybercriminals, construction firms are increasingly adopting more digital ways of working. This digital transformation combined with high cash flows, wide-spanning supply chain relationships and storage of sensitive data leaves the industry at risk of critical data breaches.\n\nIn fact, high profile cyberattacks against construction businesses have led the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to issue specific cyber defence guidance for the industry. Launched in partnership with the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB), the targeted advice for small-to-medium sized businesses addresses why cybersecurity matters and recommends particular measures that should be adopted to bolster cybersecurity strategies.\n\nSo, what else is contributing to the vulnerability of construction businesses and what cyber defence can industry leaders and IT teams implement to address these cyber threats?\n\nConstruction industry is lagging behind in cybersecurity awareness\n\nAlongside manufacturing, the construction industry is lagging behind in terms of its digital transformation and cybersecurity awareness. This issue is also compounded by the nature of its high cash-flow business, rendering construction companies both high priority and low hanging fruit for hackers who are increasingly exploiting gaps in security strategies to effectively target and hold data to ransom.\n\nThe UK Government’s Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2022, published in March, revealed that only 56% of respondents have a policy not to pay ransomware. What is particularly concerning here is that this translates to nearly half of organisations either considering paying or not planning ahead at all.\n\nTypically less mature in IT and cybersecurity processes and strategies, it’s vital for construction businesses to understand that data is compromised as soon as it is breached – even if a ransom is paid – and that paying up must stop.\n\nAnother contributing factor to the industry’s cyber vulnerability is the traditional understaffing of IT departments. A strong leadership approach around cybersecurity is required to ensure boardrooms and IT teams are aligned on cyber defence strategies and keep them front of mind going forward.\n\nThe implementation and consistent use of basic cyber hygiene practices, patching and regular penetration testing can all reduce the likelihood of a data breach. These strategies are also strengthened by staff training, conducted little and often, to help mitigate both internal and external threats.\n\nNature of construction projects is leaving organisations at risk of cyberattacks\n\nThe nature of construction projects is leaving organisations at risk of cyberattacks. For instance, some projects cover hugely critical and highly sensitive sites. This means that construction organisations will often serve as back-door entrances for hackers to enter larger networks – e.g., within the public sector or government.\n\nThe bottom line is that construction companies are vulnerable to exploitation by bad actors if they form part of the wider supply chain that serves Critical National Infrastructure and stores sensitive data. What’s more, businesses in the industry also store confidential information themselves, such as intellectual property, data around property assets and architectural drawings and specifications of government buildings – all of which are valuable and open to abuse if compromised by hackers.\n\nConstruction enterprises of all sizes, therefore, need to implement stringent cybersecurity measures to protect themselves as part of supply chains and as standalone organisations. This is especially pertinent when considering the Cyber Security Breaches Survey found that only 13% of organisations review the risks posed by their immediate suppliers (and this figure drops to 7% for the wider supply chain).\n\nIt is concerning that businesses are underestimating the security risks associated with having or being part of supply chains, as hackers continue to deploy increasingly sophisticated and targeted attacks through third-party providers.\n\nThe recent high-profile Okta breach serves as a stark warning of the potential damage that can be caused by this type of attack. Construction businesses should therefore look to implement proactive security measures, such as contractually agreed liability around breaches, well-defined security policies and regular penetration testing, to help mitigate vulnerabilities. A Zero Trust architecture can also offer additional protection against a supply chain attack by removing the implicit trust given to internal users.\n\nDue to the tender process for projects in the industry, companies are also required to have some form of cyber defence strategy in place in order to win large contracts. The UK Government, for example, will not award projects to any business that is not meeting the more rigorous cyber regulations that have been introduced in recent years.\n\nYet seeing cybersecurity as a tick box exercise simply to win new business is not enough. And although the industry is on its journey toward a full culture shift regarding cybersecurity, there is still a long way to go. In the meantime, construction businesses should consider working with an external security partner to take on these cyber defence requirements.\n\nAn outsourced Security Operations Centre (SOC) can not only demonstrate organisations’ commitment to cybersecurity, it will also ensure that threat monitoring becomes a 24/7/365 activity and cyberattacks are identified and mitigated before compromising an entire network.\n\nDevices used by construction enterprises are a source of vulnerability\n\nThe devices used by construction enterprises in projects are also a source of vulnerability. According to research, 95% of construction organisations believe that emerging technology – like IoT – will fundamentally impact their industry in the future.\n\nHowever, the increasing convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) with Operational Technology (OT) is a point of weakness. Many OT environments were not designed with the intention of being connected to the wider IT environment, and consequently, connectivity and cybersecurity were not a top priority. As the industry is increasingly reliant on OT, it is critical to recognise the risk this poses to the wider IT network.\n\nTo ensure the entire OT and IT network is protected, an outsourced SOC can alleviate some of the pressure being felt by understaffed and overloaded construction industry IT teams. A SOC is able to alert businesses to security events as they arise, investigating and neutralising them to prevent lasting damage to organisations.\n\nDrawing on the aggregate value of cyber experts with extensive knowledge of the threatscape, it is one of the best ways to bolster the industry’s cybersecurity posture and support businesses to prioritise and embrace the protections to keep their organisations safe.\n\nConstruction industry is becoming a bigger target for cybercriminals\n\nThe construction industry is only becoming a bigger target for cybercriminals, as demonstrated by the publication of the NCSC’s latest guidance. It is therefore vital for businesses who are more at risk due to the nature of the industry, their projects and devices, to act proactively and implement strong, comprehensive cybersecurity measures.\n\nNot only will this help to reinforce their defences against potential attacks, but it will also aid construction organisations in their broader cultural shift towards cybersecurity awareness as they continue to embrace a more digital future',

#  {'title': 'The Top 3 Things You Need to Know About Client-Side Web Application Attacks',
#   'text': 'Client-side web application attacks are like the Kardashians. They’re everywhere, they’re annoying, and have the potential to cause catastrophic impacts wherever they are found. These threats represent an area of 3rd party risk for any web property conducting transactions or collecting sensitive information — with organizations across retail, healthcare, financial services, hospitality, and so on, falling victim in recent months and years. To combat these hacks and mitigate future threats, it’s critical for InfoSec teams at all levels of the business to understand why and how vulnerabilities in your 3rd party digital supply chain can lead to these client-side attacks.\n\nHow are bad actors using your digital supply chain to enable these attacks? What makes it so easy for them to do it, and for most organizations to detect at the current time? The answer is an overlooked and almost ubiquitous hole in web security — one that could allow hackers to access millions of sensitive pieces of data, leaving you with costly and reputation-damaging repercussions. Now more than ever, InfoSec teams need to prioritize finding effective solutions to protect their business and clients from client-side web application attacks and the potential fines and legal action that will likely ensue if a data breach occurs.\n\nTo help you make sense of it all and to jumpstart your journey towards mitigating this risk, we’ve put together a list of the top three things you need to understand about client-side web application attacks, which vulnerabilities lead to them, and how prevention-first client-side web application security is the ultimate solution.\n\n1. Your 3rd Party Digital Supply Chain is Leaving Your Business Open to Client-Side Web Application Attacks\n\n3rd party partners are critical to the performance of your web properties — they power analytics, drive interaction, support multimedia, drive and enable transactions, support development, etc. But they are also the key to providing access to the sensitive and privacy-protected data you are collecting and delivering to cybercriminals. These partners add a lot of value to your website but they have also become a preferred attack vector. The 3rd, 4th and nth party script they run on the client-side is effectively shadow code that you are serving to your visitors, and that code is being manipulated to enable client-side attacks. These types of attacks are so common that:\n\nIn 2022, we’ve already seen hundreds of attacks including a high-profile attack on Segway.\n\nIn November 2021, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) announced that 4,151 retailers had been compromised by hackers attempting to steal customers’ payment information and other personal data via client-side vulnerabilities on checkout pages.\n\nattempting to steal customers’ payment information and other personal data via client-side vulnerabilities on checkout pages. Throughout 2021 hundreds of attacks occurred on a monthly basis.\n\nAnd back in 2020, cybercriminals used the same techniques to compromise an estimated 2,800 retailers, injecting malicious code to steal the payment details of hundreds of thousands of customers.\n\nThe problem here is that cybercriminals are lurking in the shadows and taking advantage of a backdoor security hole in JavaScript that most organizations fail to recognize. Regardless of the source, JavaScript gives all scripts the same level of control on the client-side. Therefore, the 3rd party code driving your site has complete access and authorship capabilities. And like a thief in the night, cybercriminals leverage this vulnerability to hijack sensitive data including customers’ personal and financial information.\n\nFor more information on how cybercriminals leverage 3rd party JavaScript to infiltrate your site, get your copy of our white paper, The Hidden Risk in Your Digital Supply Chain.\n\n2. Form Submission Data is The Most Commonly Attacked and Accessed Data\n\nThe most common client-side web application attack occurs via form submissions. Better known as formjacking, this type of cyber attack occurs when cybercriminals compromise scripts using 3rd party applications or plugins as a way into the web session. This enables the hackers to gain control over its entry point where sensitive information is provided, like a submission form to make a purchase, for example.\n\nFormjacking occurs when cybercriminals inject malicious JavaScript code into a site (through the security hole discussed above) to gain read/write access to other forms and pages that utilize JavaScript on that site. Once control of the JavaScript has been seized, the page will appear to operate as normal to visitors. Thus, visitors will feel comfortable providing their personal information into a form on this page, while unknowingly, placing it directly into the hands of criminals.\n\nThe result of these attacks typically leads to:\n\nPurchases being processed by the cybercriminals using your clients’ credit card information\n\nSelling this private information to various bidders on the dark web\n\nIdentity theft scams\n\n3. Focusing Only On Securing the Server-Side and Neglecting Client-Side Security is a Huge Mistake\n\nLet’s call it like it is — server-side protections such as web application firewalls (WAF) are not enough to call your site secure. The problem is once a cybercriminal’s code is injected into a web session, it’s already surpassed the protection of server-side security. The code is dynamically downloaded from a remote server, which means that it bypasses the traditional security infrastructure, including the retailer’s firewalls and WAFs. Additionally, there is no way to use server-side security solutions to prevent criminal code from exfiltrating data or executing other corrupt activity from a customer’s browser.\n\nConsider this, the big corporations like TicketMaster, Segway, and British Airlines all invested heavily to protect their customer data yet still remained vulnerable to client-side attacks. And yet, all three (and many more) of these organizations have experienced client-side web application attacks very recently. Plus, since 2017, 150 million payment cards were detected as being compromised via client-side attacks, with cybercriminals attempting to monetize the cards on the dark web for an estimated total of $37 billion.\n\nThat being said, it’s time to focus on prevention-first client-side web application security.\n\nClient-Side Web Application Security is Vital to Protecting Client Data\n\nThe most important step in securing client-side web apps and mitigating 3rd-party risk is to prevent attacks before they occur. Source Defense is designed to do just that — prevent attacks in the first place. With real-time sandbox isolation and reflection, Source Defense ensures that none of the JavaScript running on your sites, including 3rd (or 4th, 5th, 6th+), can be used as an attack vector.\n\nPrevention-first client-side web application security protects your site from:\n\nDigital skimming\n\nFormjacking\n\nMagecart attacks\n\nAnd other security vulnerabilities\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile client-side web app security should be every online organization’s top priority, the last thing you need is another tool to burden your team with alerts. We get it. Source Defense is easy to deploy, doesn’t burden your teams with more alerts, and is typically managed with fewer than 5 hours per month. Sounds pretty cool, huh? We think so too. But it’s not just cool, it’s essential.\n\nRequest a demo to start protecting your site, your business, and your clients.\n\nThe post The Top 3 Things You Need to Know About Client-Side Web Application Attacks appeared first on Source Defense.\n\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Blog – Source Defense authored by [email protected].

#  {'title': 'Researchers Uncover How Colibri Malware Stays Persistent on Hacked Systems',
#   'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a "simple but efficient" persistence mechanism adopted by a relatively nascent malware loader called Colibri, which has been observed deploying a Windows information stealer known as Vidar as part of a new campaign.\n\n"The attack starts with a malicious Word document deploying a Colibri bot that then delivers the Vidar Stealer," Malwarebytes Labs said in an analysis. "The document contacts a remote server at (securetunnel[.]co) to load a remote template named \'trkal0.dot\' that contacts a malicious macro," the researchers added.\n\nFirst documented by FR3D.HK and Indian cybersecurity company CloudSEK earlier this year, Colibri is a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform that\'s engineered to drop additional payloads onto compromised systems. Early signs of the loader appeared on Russian underground forums in August 2021.\n\n"This loader has multiple techniques that help avoid detection," CloudSEK researcher Marah Aboud noted last month. "This includes omitting the IAT (Import Address Table) along with the encrypted strings to make the analysis more difficult."\n\nThe campaign attack chain observed by Malwarebytes takes advantage of a technique called remote template injection to download the Colibri loader ("setup.exe") by means of a weaponized Microsoft Word document.\n\nThe loader then makes use of a previously undocumented persistence method to survive machine reboots, but not before dropping its own copy to the location "%APPDATA%\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps" and naming it "Get-Variable.exe."\n\nIt achieves this by creating a scheduled task on systems running Windows 10 and above, with the loader executing a command to launch PowerShell with a hidden window (i.e., -WindowStyle Hidden) to conceal the malicious activity from being detected.\n\n"It so happens that Get-Variable is a valid PowerShell cmdlet (a cmdlet is a lightweight command used in the Windows PowerShell environment) which is used to retrieve the value of a variable in the current console," the researchers explained.\n\nBut given the fact that PowerShell is executed by default in the WindowsApps path, the command issued during the scheduled task creation results in the execution of the malicious binary in the place of its legitimate counterpart.\n\nThis effectively means that "an adversary can easily achieve persistence [by] combining a scheduled task and any payload (as long as it is called Get-Variable.exe and placed in the proper location)," the researchers said.\n\nThe latest findings come as cybersecurity company Trustwave last month detailed an email-based phishing campaign that leverages Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files to distribute the Vidar malware in an effort to fly under the radar.',

#   'text': 'Darktrace is beta testing a cybersecurity platform that uses its artificial intelligence (AI) engine to map potential attack paths cybercriminals might exploit to gain access to enterprise IT environments.\n\nNicole Eagan, chief strategy officer and AI officer for Darktrace, told attendees at the Cyber Security Summit in Miami that a forthcoming Darktrace Prevents offering will use algorithms to model how cybercriminals might employ various attack paths to compromise an organization.\n\nEagan said Darktrace Prevents is expected to become generally available this summer and will also enable organizations to test countermeasures.\n\nDarktrace Prevents is, in part, based on technologies the company gained with the acquisition of Cybersprint B.V., a provider of a tool that employs machine learning algorithms to surface vulnerabilities. It provides an alternative to hiring external security professionals to conduct penetration testing. Rather than conducting those tests once or twice a year, the Cybersprint approach enables organizations to continuously scan their environments for vulnerabilities. That’s critical because IT environments today are more dynamic than ever; most penetration testing reports are outdated within a few days of being filed.\n\nThe Cybersprint platform extends the current Darktrace Detect and Respond platform that also uses machine learning algorithms to both discover anomalies indicative of cyberthreats and quarantine those threats in real-time. The Darktrace Detect and Respond platform is based on attack path modeling that uses graphs to surface network nodes. A weighted graph can be used to identify the path of least resistance to key assets to estimate the probability that an adversary will be able to conduct successful lateral movement from node A to node B. That capability provides a realistic assessment in real-time of the attack patterns that will be employed against an organization’s most critical assets.\n\nIn effect, the acquisition of Cybersprint extends Darktrace’s goal to provide a continuous cybersecurity AI loop based on machine learning algorithms that learn the IT environment they protect.\n\nIt’s not clear to what degree cybersecurity teams are embracing AI just yet. However, as attacks increase in volume and sophistication, AI technologies provide a way to augment chronically understaffed cybersecurity teams. In fact, as IT environments become more extended, it’s unlikely cybersecurity teams will be able to defend every attack surface without the aid of machine learning algorithms.\n\nThat said, it’s unlikely AI—in the form of machine learning algorithms—will replace the need for cybersecurity professionals any time soon. However, they will go a long way toward rebalancing a playing field that today is decidedly tilted in favor of the cybercriminal who only need to find and exploit one weakness to be successful. In fact, it’s now more a question of the degree to which AI will augment overwhelmed cybersecurity professionals who are being attacked from all sides.',

#   'text': 'Actress Rima Kallingal, who recently attended an open forum at the Regional International Film Festival of Kerala (RIFFK), in Ernakulam, faced severe cyber attacks for wearing a short skirt. The cyberattacks began soon after the visuals of the actress speaking in the open forum appeared on YouTube channels. In the video, the actress is seen wearing a casual white shirt and knee length denim skirt. Most of the comments under her videos were abusive and some even questioned the actress\' personal freedom.\n\nWhile someone asked if she saw the clothes she was wearing when she came to talk about sexual violence in films, some started moral policing by teaching her how to dress "decently". Going by the comments, it looks like Malayalis are yet to come to terms with the fact that \'women have legs\'. For the unversed, it was less than two years ago, many Mollywood celebs and Kerala girls created a wave on Instagram by posting photos of themselves flaunting their legs with the caption #WomenHave Legs. The wave was started after several netizens cyber attacked teenage actress Anaswara Rajan for showing off her legs in a photo shoot. Though two years have passed by, still nothing seems to have changed the mindset of people!\n\nRima Kallingal has always been at the forefront in the fight for the rights of women in the industry for the past several years. Also one of the founding members of the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) formed in the aftermath of the sexual assault on her friend and fellow actor in 2017, the actress was talking at the open forum about sexual harassment at workplace. In the discussion, the actress said that it is unbelievable that there has never been a place in a state like Kerala for so long for the people working in the film industry to talk about their bad experience in the film industry.

#  {'title': 'Offline: Ukraine—difficult lessons for global health',
#   'text': "It is easy to condemn Russia for its criminal war against Ukraine. For its attacks on health workers and hospitals. For its violations of international humanitarian law. For its acts of murderous cruelty against civilians. For increasing the risks of a nuclear conflagration. It is right to call for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. To accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid. To provide safe haven for refugees. To document atrocities and to counter disinformation. And to hold the Governments of Russia and Belarus accountable for their crimes of aggression. For scientists and their journals, it is straightforward to say that we will not enter into cooperative agreements with the institutions of aggressor nations. This much is not difficult. But what should we say and do about those countries that have chosen to be neutral about the war in Ukraine?\n\nCopyright © 2022 Kyodo News via Getty Images\n\nOn March 2, 2022, 141 of 193 UN member states voted to condemn Russia's decision to go to war with Ukraine. Five countries voted against—Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Russia, and Syria. 35 countries abstained, including China and India. 12 countries did not vote. Of the countries that either abstained or did not vote, half (23) were in sub-Saharan Africa. Western nations have encouraged the Chinese Government to persuade Vladimir Putin to end the conflict. The EU has said that China will suffer “major reputational damage” if it undermines sanctions against Russia. The US Government has warned China of “severe consequences” if it supplies Russia with military assistance. Western commentators argue that Ukraine is a moral test for Xi Jinping. His failure to intervene for peace, they argue, will make his pledge of “win–win cooperation” with the west utterly worthless. But although Xi has called for “maximum restraint”, he has refused to condemn Russia's actions. His government has blamed the USA as the “leading instigator of the Ukraine crisis”. Wang Yi, China's Foreign Minister, met his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, last week and, perhaps mindful that China is Russia's biggest trade partner, noted that “China–Russia cooperation has no limits”. Reports are emerging that China launched cyber-attacks on Ukraine shortly before Russia's invasion on Feb 24. India presents an even more complex challenge. Again, western nations have put pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to condemn Russian aggression. But while Modi declined to meet the UK's Foreign Minister, he did give an audience to Lavrov, who praised India's neutrality over Ukraine. If China is so intimately complicit in the war against Ukraine, and if India's neutrality is maintained, what should be the position of western scientists (and journals) regarding collaborations with Chinese and Indian institutions? Does complicity or neutrality compel institutional excommunication?\n\nCopyright © 2022 Prakash Singh/AFP via Getty Images\n\nCopyright © 2022 Shamil Zhumatov/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSome western observers claim that the Ukraine crisis marks the end of globalisation. Or that this conflict is a war between democracy and autocracy. It is neither. I do not believe there is an active desire from China, India, and a large part of Africa to side with Putin. Instead, what their declared “neutrality” signifies is a resistance to US and European expectations of compliance. The clue came from India's Minister of External Affairs, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. In his meetings with foreign ministers last week, he pointed to the importance of an evolving multipolar world, one no longer constrained by one superpower or one ideology. He spoke about the diffusion of global power and the legitimacy of the G20 over the G7. Yes, we in global health must condemn Russia's crimes of aggression. But we should no longer be supporting those seeking to preserve a unipolar world order. Our global health institutions should not be the embodiment of such unipolarity. We should actively reject the convention that only Americans can be the President of the World Bank and the Executive Director of UNICEF. We should ask why the Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Chief Executive Officer of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance have always been European or American. We should ask why the leaders of leading global health academic institutions (and, yes, scientific journals) lack the diversity one would expect in a truly multipolar world. The war in Ukraine is certainly savage and unlawful. But the international response to this illegal conflict also reflects deep and enduring injustices of power that global health cannot ignore.",

#   'text': 'Leonardo has opened its Cyber & Security Academy, the new high-level training centre established by the company to provide Defence, public administrations, critical infrastructures and businesses the skills and capabilities necessary to support the digital transition and face threats to national security.\n\nThe Cyber & Security Academy, based in Genoa, will offer courses and seminars in Italy and abroad through various structures on the territory. The aim of the training course is to make cyber security a systemic theme for all organisations.\n\nThe proprietary platforms Cyber Range and Cyber Trainer are at the core of the Academy. Designed with the principles of gamification (using mechanisms similar to those of games, with the assignment of objectives and rewards for each achievement), they leverage both virtualisation and interoperability to simulate immersive operational scenarios. Utilising “digital twins” of networks, systems and applications to be protected, as well as threats and tools for both attack and defence, both individuals and groups will be able to put into practice the skills acquired to defend the infrastructure. Leonardo’s platforms are able to support exercises with digital twins of thousands of nodes and hundreds of networks, simulating up to five complex scenarios simultaneously, with multiple teams and tens of users per team.\n\nThe Cyber & Security Academy will count on the experience acquired by Leonardo in the physical and cyber protection of critical infrastructures in over 150 countries around the world and on the information assets developed by dealing on a daily basis with particularly sophisticated threats in the most critical and strategic domains: Aerospace, Defence and Security. With over 100,000 cyber-protected users, Leonardo monitors approximately 115,000 security events per second and manages over 1,800 cyber alarms per day.\n\nFaculty will be comprised of professionals in critical security domains, utilising the skills of Leonardo’s experts and of collaboration with the academic world, centers of excellence, institutions and companies.\n\nThe Cyber & Security Academy also represents an opportunity for the territory and the Italian training supply chain, supporting Leonardo’s Lab and HPC davinci-1 in the industrial digitisation hub created by Leonardo in Genoa.\n\nThe Cyber & Security Academy is meant for all actors involved in national security. Security is increasingly being put to the test by cyber threats: according to the latest report by CLUSIT (the Italian Association for Information Security), 2,049 serious cyber-attacks were recorded in the world in 2021, almost 10 percent more than in 2020, and cybercrime has cost $6 trillion globally. Through its cyber threat intelligence activity, in 2021 Leonardo identified macro cyber threats linked both to eCrime, aimed at financial profit, and to growing cyber intrusions to the detriment of government, defence, aerospace and health sectors, but also of energy and telecommunications, without forgetting the industrial world. The objectives are the most disparate: from the collection and exfiltration of sensitive data and information, to sabotage, up to the compromise of strategic infrastructures and defence capabilities of governments and institutions.',

#   'text': 'New research from NCC Group suggests that cyber attacks on supply chains increased by 51% in the last six months of 2021\n\nOrganisations have an opportunity to reduce their third-party risk by clarifying whether they or their suppliers are responsible for supply chain risk management, according to new global research of 1400 cyber security decision makers by NCC Group.\n\nAround one in three (36%) said that they are more responsible for preventing, detecting and resolving supply chain attacks than their suppliers. Just over half (53%) said that their company and its suppliers are equally responsible for the security of supply chains.\n\nThis could affect organisations\' third-party risk if it means that they are not conducting appropriate due diligence on their suppliers, and could expose them to regulatory penalties. The EU\'s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) mandates that financial entities include key security requirements in their contracts with third parties, indicating that regulators are increasingly emphasising the organisation\'s role in supplier risk management.\n\nDespite this, half (49%) of the organisations surveyed said that they did not stipulate security standards that their suppliers must adhere to as part of their contracts. One in three (34%) said that they do not regularly monitor and risk assess their suppliers\' cyber security arrangements.\n\nThe research suggests that cyber security attacks on company supply chains increased by 51% between July and December 2021. Only one in three (32%) organisations were \'very confident\' that they could respond quickly and effectively to a supply chain attack.\n\nEncouragingly, respondents recognised supplier risk as one of their top challenges for the next 6-12 months and plan to increase their security budgets by an average of 10% this year.\n\nArina Palchik, Global Commercial Director, Remediation, at NCC Group, said: "Many organisations work closely with their suppliers by integrating them into their infrastructures to increase efficiencies and strengthen operations, but this can increase their cyber risk by widening their potential attack surfaces. Security gaps in supply chains can lead to leakage of customer data and serve as entry points for ransomware attacks, and our latest research suggests that hackers are increasingly targeting organisations through their suppliers, with attacks up by fifty-one per cent in the last six months of 2021.\n\n"It\'s encouraging that organisations recognise supplier risk as one of their top challenges for 2022. However, our findings uncovered specific areas for improvement including clarity around responsibility for preventing, detecting and resolving attacks and lax controls for supplier assurance. It\'s important that any investment in security addresses these areas to reduce third-party risk and enable organisations to work with their suppliers in confidence."\n\nTo join NCC Group\'s webinar on how organisations can reduce supplier and third-party risk, register here.\n\nInsight Space - Issue 6 - Supply Chain\n\nIn the latest edition of our Insight Space series, we explain how you can prevent, detect and respond to supply chain attacks. We also outline how you can reduce third-party risk by adopting a risk-based approach to supplier management.\n\nDownload here.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nThis research included a survey of approximately 1400 cyber security decision makers at organisations with over 500 employees in 11 countries including the UK, United States, Australia, Singapore, Japan, China and Germany. The survey was conducted in December 2021 and January 2022.',

#   'text': 'Network cybersecurity risks are on the rise with weekly attacks on corporate networks up by 50 percent in 2021 . On the day of writing this blog, there were more than 28 million cyber-attacks globally. To combat these threats, CIOs have initiated increased spending in cybersecurity, with 60 percent noting it was their biggest business priority.\n\nDicker Data is at the forefront of technology and cybersecurity, working with a range of world-class vendor partners to ensure our resellers are best equipped to provide their end-users the most advanced protection, no matter their size or operating model. As your value-added distributor, we proactively work with you as strategic business partners and support you to build and implement forward thinking solutions suited for your customer\'s dynamically evolving environment.\n\nCyber criminals are increasingly adopting sophisticated new methods and strategies for breaching corporate networks. They are attacking with more sophistication and increased frequency, not only targeting network exploits, but vectors such as remote workers, unsecured connections, and bring your own devices (BYOD). Here are three trends to be on the lookout for this year:\n\n1. Increased ransomware attacks- Data is a business\' greatest asset and a breach in security not only costs the business financially, but also impacts reputation, credibility and trust with customers, employees, regulators and the broader industry. An increase of 82 percent in Ransomware attacks across Australian corporates has been recorded in the past year, making this the largest, targeted and increased area of attacks across all threats.\n\n2. Endpoint security is key- Traditional ways of working have shifted. With increased remote and hybrid models, personal device usage, and increased flexibility, cyber criminals have the perfect opportunities and expanded access points for the perfect storm. Working with Dicker Data as a strategic business partner, IT professionals access a range of leading global vendors who specialise in solutions for endpoint security. Read our latest blog here, to find the answers to modern end-point security.\n\n3. AI on the rise- AI is critical in cybersecurity because it recognises new threats based on patterns that a previous and known threat may have also exhibited. NetWitness solutions, including NetWitness Detect AI, incorporate AI technology to collect and analyse data across all capture points and computing platforms. They enrich data with threat intelligence and business context, accelerating detection and response. Dicker Data is a NetWitness exclusive distribution partner.\n\nAs a value-added distributor, Dicker Data works with our valued partners to keep you one step ahead. We offer Penetration Testing services to fully assess end-user vulnerabilities, enabling us to design tailored network security solutions.

For Dicker Data, training is critical. We offer prevention testing services and vendor enablement and certification support. Additional \'Train the Trainer\' sessions on cybersecurity awareness empowers our partners to also facilitate their own training with end-users. This means your customers are well positioned to identify suspicious links and threats, preventing breaches and improving the first line of defence.\n\nCloud networks improve operating efficiencies but can limit day-to-day system and data visibility, increasing cybersecurity risks. Forcepoint combines enterprise-class SD-WAN, advanced intrusion prevention, and seamless integration with cloud-based Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) security to secure and monitor hybrid, cloud, and multi-cloud infrastructures in one centrally managed console. SASE blocks 100 percent of evasion attempts and more than 99 percent of exploits.\n\nOrganisations need visibility into cloud applications across the business, increased visibility of location and user internet access while reducing threat detection and containment times and mitigating breach damage and remediation costs. Cisco Umbrella enables this, providing a single-solution, cloud-delivered security service. It helps customers effectively manage the expansion of remote working, roaming users, and direct-to-internet access, while ensuring security remains front of mind. In today\'s rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, speed and agility is key and 74 percent of Cisco users identified fast and easy deployment as the top benefit of the Umbrella solution.\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) is also an integral part of a robust security solution across both cloud and traditional networks. SecurID Access provides businesses a high level of assurance of user authenticity without compromising security or convenience. SecurID Governance & Lifestyle gives full access visibility and advanced analytics across applications to detect identity risks and compliance issues and prioritise organisational response. Together, the SecurID suite offers comprehensive MFA for over 30 million users.\n\nIt is a vital governance responsibility to take a \'Zero Trust\' approach to cybersecurity, ensuring users are fully identified and authenticated before accessing a network and resources. VMware\'s SASE platform ensures this with a suite of security solutions to prevent information being disclosed to unauthorised users or devices, all while ensuring a frictionless user experience. This is especially important in a remote/hybrid work scenario with a disparate workforce where simplicity and consistency is key. Workspace ONE and VMware SD-WAN come together to enable secure, optimised, and high-performance access for users no matter their location.\n\nMicrosoft also take a Zero Trust approach to network security, offering a comprehensive range of services that integrate seamlessly to provide multi-layer protection. For example, Microsoft Sentinel provides a birds-eye-view across all Microsoft infrastructure, applications, and services in use. It incorporates threat intelligence, data collection, investigation and advanced hunting, AI driven detection, built in orchestration and automated response to comprehensively protect. With cyberthreats growing increasingly sophisticated, legacy IT and security systems may no longer be enough. A Zero Trust approach should extend throughout the entire digital estate and serve as an integrated security philosophy and end-to-end strategy.\n\nProactively identifying and preventing an attack before it breaches the network is the best form of defence. Check Point\'s Solutions prioritise prevention, before detecting and response ensuring its security gateways identify and prevent threats before it impacts the network. Core to any security network, the Check Point Quantum set of solutions are designed to secure traditional perimeters across datacentres, enterprises, branch offices, entire campus, and SMB\'s, as well as internal Core Segmentation.

#   'text': 'More than 125 people filled the Elson S. Floyd Cultural Center on the Pullman campus Wednesday to hear about how advances in science and technology are influencing the nation’s response to threats ranging from emerging disease to climate change.\n\nKimberly Budil, director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, delved into these topics and more as part of her lecture – National Security in the 21st Century: Deterrence, Bio-Resilience, Energy, and Climate. Budil visited the Pullman campus to deliver the Institute for Shock Physics’ John and Janet Creighton Distinguished Lecture.\n\nRussia’s ongoing war in Ukraine demonstrates the scope and diversity of threats nations need to consider in the modern world, Budil said. Of particular note are cyber-attacks that can be carried out on aging critical infrastructure and the ease of getting military assets into space.\n\n“Our old ways of thinking about conflict have to change and evolve and be much more multi-dimensional than it once was,” Budil said.\n\nBudil leads a workforce of 7,400 employees and manages an annual operating budget of approximately $2.7 billion. In her role as the national laboratory’s director, Budil sets the lab’s strategic vision and works to ensure successful programming and operations to advance the nation’s science and technology pursuits.\n\nDuring her talk, Budil touched on several threats to national security – climate change, unfriendly nation-states and groups, emerging diseases – and how scientific advances are evolving to better understand and respond to these threats. In particular is the use of computer power in modeling the impacts of climate change. Over time, the relatively short forecasting time frames available now will be able to project out further and further, giving scientists and public officials a better idea of how the changing climate will impact specific regions.\n\nCollaboration is also key to making the scientific and technological advances, both between allied nations and between public and private entities, Budil said.\n\nFollowing her lecture, Budil took questions from the audience on topics ranging from advances in nuclear fusion power to the response to COVID-19 and how scientists look to respond to the next pandemic.',

#  {'title': 'Hybrid warfare threat should be anticipated at the earliest',
#   'text': "The plan to develop a cybersecurity network in 43 work units under the Indonesian National Defense Force Headquarters (Mabes TNI) is a form of precautionary measure against the threat of hybrid warfare.The development of a cybersecurity network aims to bolster TNI's cyber defense and to protect the nation against various digital threats as well as to support the military incident response team's work.According to Chief of the National Defense Forces (TNI) General Andika Perkasa, this team was formed as a result of the cooperation between Mabes TNI and National Cyber and Crypto Agency (BSSN).As reported by ANTARA on Monday, the TNI chief along with his officials were directly updated through the material on cybersecurity network or system presented by PT Len Industry (Persero).PT Len Industry is a state-owned enterprise engaged in the field of telecommunication network and electronics for defense, among others.PT Len's representative notified the chief that the cybersecurity system works through closed circuit television (CCTV) that monitors TNI's cyber activity traffic, attack attempts, and forecast of possible attacks.The development of TNI's cybersecurity network begins with the formation of a security operation center (SOC) that will be managed under TNI's Cyber Unit (Satsiber).TNI Satsiber utilizes the SOC unit to create an analysis on attack attempts, hacking activities, and other digital attacks.The cyber unit will also receive information on cyberattacks or cyberattack attempts through detection devices.These devices are planned to be installed at TNI's 11 work units in Jakarta and Bandung, West Java. The information and data from the detection devices is delivered to TNI Satsiber through a special encrypted channel or VPN.According to the chief, there must be a special space for TNI's cybersecurity network operation.Moreover, Perkasa urged PT Len, as a partner, to provide a technician, who remains on standby at the control center room during the maintenance warranty period of 42 months.Cybersecurity expert Pratama Persadha shared his view on TNI's plan. He believes that the TNI should have the capability to handle cyber threats. In the digital era, internal and external attacks are effective in the cyber realm.TNI, as the main element of the nation's defense, should perform an update on every serious threat to the nation, including cyber threats.There are at least two serious threats, specifically cyber threats and information warfare. Currently, the concept of hybrid warfare, which is the combination of cyber warfare and information warfare, is becoming prevalent.The threat of cyber warfare pushes the TNI to prepare human resources and infrastructures that support efforts to strengthen cyber security.While BSSN already exists, the TNI still has the duty to secure infrastructure, data, and human resource assets from manipulation efforts and massive data theft.Persadha cited the example of Sony hacking cases and the attack on Ukraine's important infrastructure. These cases are an eye opener on how modern warfare currently occurs.The TNI bears a huge responsibility. However, the military force must possess cybersecurity skills first before expanding to the ability to handle cyber warfare.For instance, during the war in Ukraine, the nation's vital infrastructure was disabled first before the Russian military invaded, thereby causing the people to face issues in using social media platforms.Modern warfare no longer only relies on weaponry but also mastery over digital information channels, such as social media and cyber infrastructure security. This has become a must.Strengthening TNI's human resources and cyber infrastructure must follow the regulation development in the nation, starting from law comprehension to technical mastery and until cooperation with overseas institutions.At the very least, the people need to see how prepared the TNI is in dealing with the threat of cyber warfare, which necessitates simulation and joint practice, Persadha noted.This is especially important since other nations have become serious in bolstering their military's cyber sector, he affirmed.For instance, Malaysia strengthened its military to deal with cyberattacks since 2013.This comes to a head in 2016, in which the nation claims that its military is truly ready in terms of the system, human resources, and technical skills.Building cybersecurity capability in TNI is never too late, especially since several Indonesians are capable of helping. In fact, the domestic technology already exists, and the nation only needs to utilize it.Cyber strength in the TNI should be built on the foundation of trust among citizens in order to avoid becoming victims of foreign exploitation for utilizing overseas technologies.Persadha opined that the TNI should reform its cadre system to produce the best cyber human resources.This is important based on the increasingly pressing need for defense. To this end, human resources that understand analysis, defense, and attack, as well as possess the knowledge to build the system within the TNI become increasingly important and necessary.Every level requires reliable human resources for, as an example, monitoring and intelligence activities within the cyber realm.With this, the most important current strategy revolved around human resources. This can be developed in parallel with infrastructure development. However, without reliable human resources, all cyber infrastructure will be useless.The TNI needs a cyber team at every level and cyber command center. Hence, every level of the TNI is currently building its own cyber centre.Let us hope that within several years, this can improve TNI's capacity in the cyber realm.",

#  {'title': 'How to create a culture of security at your organization',
#   'text': 'This blog post explains how leaders can create a culture of security in their company. Cybersecurity is more important than ever, and ensuring that everyone buys into protecting the company is paramount for protecting private data. This post has 4 steps people can take to build that culture. How to create culture of security at your remote or hybrid organization The way we work has fundamentally changed. Although the initial growth of remote and hybrid work was brought on by Covid-19, working outside of the office is here to stay. It’s simply too beneficial to both employees and employers. However, the new way of work carries lots of additional risks to company data. Many companies have become remote-first without updating their information security programs to protect new workflows. This can be seen in the fact that data breaches reached records highs in 2021. Cybersecurity discourse is focused on building impenetrable security infrastructure and using tons of tools, but research from Standford found the vast majority of breaches (83%) are attributable to human errors. One of the best ways to prevent human error is by building a culture of security. Builtin defines company culture as “a set of shared values, goals, attitudes and practices that characterize an organization.” When we refer to a culture of security, we’re talking about creating a company culture that makes security a major point of emphasis. Security should be embedded in all parts of the organization’s culture and a part of daily activities. Culture isn’t built overnight. Creating a culture of security at your organization can’t be done as an annual event or on an infrequent basis. It can take years of consistently emphasizing security every day to create a culture that truly permeates your company. All employees must buy into the culture for it to be effective. However, there are some things CEOs, CISOs, and other business leaders can do to help build a solid foundation of a strong security culture in their organization. 1. Make it abundantly clear that security is everyone’s job One of the biggest downsides of remote work is that it exponentially increases the number of entry points for hackers to access a company. Employees are now able to work from home, from a coffee shop, or at an Airbnb instead of the office. Many people log into accounts containing private data on their personal devices or connect to work systems on public wifi. Employees now have a greater level of autonomy and access to company resources than before, but this autonomy creates risk. Given the increased risk profile of remote/hybrid companies, leaders at these organizations must constantly emphasize the importance of all employees following best security practices at all times. Protecting your organization’s data is no longer configured to the IT department or security teams. It is everyone’s responsibility. The most important step in building a culture of security is having the entire organization buy in to the culture and understand that maintaining security is everyone’s job. 2. Focus on rewarding good behavior instead of punishing mistakes Although human errors cause most data breaches, treating individuals as vulnerabilities instead of as people is not a good way of securing your company. Every employee should feel empowered to help their company. Studies from all fields of life have consistently shown that positive feedback is a much better tool for driving change as opposed to negative consequences. For example, if you notice an employee chose to enable MFA on their own accord you should congratulate them! People that are praised for following best practices are going to continue to follow them. On the flip side penalizing employees when they make a mistake hurts security culture. For example, an employee that self-reports accidentally sharing PHI should not be punished since they will be less likely to be honest in the future. Security errors should be treated as learning opportunities where employees can gain the knowledge needed to prevent them from making the same mistake twice. Having an open and honest culture where people are not scared to report accidents is paramount to keeping your organization safe. You should also empower employees to report potential threats or suspicious activity within the organization without fear of retaliation. 3. Convey the impacts of weak security posture Another way leaders can build a culture of security is by showcasing how security lapses hurt everyone. For example, a data breach could hurt your company by losing customer trust and/or paying regulatory fines. Research shows that 31% of corporate data breaches lead to employee layoffs. You should explain how preventing security incidents is in everyone’s best interest since it helps the company while protecting everyone’s livelihood. Leaders should use real-life examples of breaches to show how everyday employees can serve as either assets or liabilities for their company’s defenses. For example, the recent Lapsus$ breach was caused by employees approving MFA requests because of notification fatigue. Snapchat was breached when an employee shared confidential data with a hacker that was impersonating their CEO. Tying real-life events to everyday actions helps employees understand the impacts of their actions and incentives them to participate in the security process. 4. Integrate security awareness into normal workflows This is one of the most important steps in building a culture of security. Employees should receive cybersecurity training and tips within the context of real work. Annual check-the-box training in an outdated LMS is no longer enough to deal with an evolving threat landscape. High-quality training is necessary to ensure that employees protect data at all times. Security awareness training should meet employees in the apps they use and relate to securing common workflows. The entire company should undergo security awareness training, even employees in non-technical roles. Your security team and senior management should utilize training to educate employees to recognize threats such as phishing emails to prevent cyber attacks that could comprimise your business security. Haekka’s Slack-based security awareness training is a great way to build a culture of security in your organization. Haekka’s platform is launching event-driven training to automatically help employees avoid risky actions. Haekka also has quizzes, weekly security tips, and a large training catalog with multiple types of security awareness and compliance training. It also collects evidence of training to make passing audits a breeze!

#  {'title': 'How secure is your cloud storage? Mitigating data security risks in the cloud',
#   'text': 'As cloud systems are increasingly the bedrock on which digital transformation is built, keeping a close eye on how they are secured is an essential cybersecurity best practice\n\nFor weeks, cybersecurity experts and government agencies have been urging organizations to enhance their cyber-defenses due to the increased threat of cyberattacks amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That means not only improving detection and response for emerging threats, but also building stronger resilience into infrastructure so that it can better withstand attack. This might be a significant undertaking. After two years of digital transformation during the pandemic, many organizations have a much larger attack surface today than they did pre-COVID.\n\nCloud resources are particularly vulnerable as many have been accidentally misconfigured and sit exposed, without protection. As such, online databases and storage buckets could be an attractive target for attackers should fears over cyberattacks escalating beyond the conflict in Ukraine materialize. In fact, researchers have already observed raids on cloud databases in recent weeks, and there are plenty of threat actors out there waiting to take advantage.\n\nThe value of the public cloud\n\nCloud systems are increasingly the bedrock on which digital transformation is built. They provide a relatively low cost, scalable and flexible way to store and manage data – with a lower management burden for IT, built-in disaster recovery and anywhere, anytime access. As a backend for applications, databases stored in the public cloud could contain:\n\nBusiness-critical corporate data\n\nPersonally identifiable information belonging to employees and customers\n\nHighly sensitive IP and trade secrets\n\nIT/admin information such as APIs or encryption keys, which could be leveraged in future attacks\n\nIt goes without saying that if any of this data found its way into the wrong hands, it could be hugely damaging for a victim organization, potentially leading to regulatory fines, legal costs, IT overtime costs, lost productivity and sales, customer churn and reputational damage.\n\nThe problem with cloud databases\n\nThe challenge is that cloud storage and databases are easily misconfigured. And once left exposed, they could be relatively easily found with off-the-shelf internet scanning tools. This exemplifies the challenge defenders have: they need to get security right every time, whereas attackers need only get lucky once.\n\nThe challenge is particularly acute given the complexity of modern enterprise cloud environments. Most organizations are running a combination of on-premises and public/private clouds, and investing with multiple providers to spread their risk. One report suggests 92% have a multi-cloud strategy, while 82% are investing in hybrid cloud. It’s difficult for IT teams to keep up-to-speed with the functionality of one cloud service provider (CSP), never mind two or three. And these CSPs are constantly adding new features in response to customer requests. While this provides organizations with a huge set of granular options, it arguably also makes it harder to do the simple things well.\n\nIt’s especially problematic for developer or DevOps teams, which often don’t have specialized security training. A recent analysis of over 1.3 million Android and iOS apps, revealed that 14% of those which used public cloud services in their backend were exposing user information via misconfigurations.\n\nAs mentioned in a previous article, cloud misconfiguration can take many forms, the most common being:\n\nMissing access restrictions\n\nSecurity group policies which are too permissive\n\nA lack of permissions controls\n\nMisunderstood internet connectivity paths\n\nMisconfigured virtualized network functions\n\nCloud systems are already being targeted\n\nIn the event of an escalation in hostilities, exposed cloud systems would be a natural target. Many are relatively easy to discover and compromise: for example, accounts left open without encryption or password protection. In fact, researchers have already observed some activity of this sort – in this case, targeting cloud databases located in Russia.\n\nOut of a random sample of 100 misconfigured cloud databases, the research found that 92 had been compromised. Some had file names replaced with anti-war messages, but the largest number were completely wiped using a simple script.\n\nThe risk to Western organizations is, therefore, of:\n\nFiles held to ransom: Recently published intelligence suggests that pro-Russian cybercrime groups are gearing up to attack targets. They may combine hacktivist-style targeting with tactics designed to monetize attacks. The contents of cloud databases have been held hostage many times before.\n\nDestructive attacks: As has already been observed, it’s relatively easy to wipe the contents of cloud databases completely, once accessed. The script detected in recent pro-Ukraine attacks is said to have resembled that used in the infamous “Meow” attacks of 2020.\n\nData leakage: Before wiping data completely, threat actors may look to analyze it for any sensitive information, and leak that first in order to maximize the financial and reputational damage inflicted on victim organizations.\n\nHow to secure your cloud databases\n\nTackling the cloud misconfiguration challenge is, sadly, not as easy as flicking a switch. However, there are several changes you can make today to help mitigate the risks highlighted above. They include:\n\nShifting security left in DevOps, by building automated security and configuration checks into the development process\n\nContinuously managing configuration settings, with cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools\n\nUsing CSPs’ built-in tools for monitoring and secure management of cloud infrastructure\n\nUsing policy as code (PaC) tools to automatically scan and assess compliance posture in the cloud\n\nEncrypting sensitive data as standard, so that if access controls are left misconfigured, hackers can’t view what’s inside\n\nAs cloud infrastructure grows, so does the cyberattack surface. War or no war, these best practices should be applied to mitigate mounting cyber risk.\n\nSign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center Submit',

#  {'title': 'Secretary Blinken Announces Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy — IR INSIDER',
#   'text': 'On Monday, the US State Department announced the establishment of the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy (CDP). Beginning operations the same day, the CDP bureau combines previously separated offices and is the Department’s newest initiative to promote and secure US interests in the online world. The office will be headed in the interim by senior Foreign Service members until President Biden appoints an ambassador-at-large.\n\nBy confronting issues from cyberattacks to e-commerce, the CDP bureau is paramount to the State Department’s capabilities in the 21st century. Secretary of State Blinken emphasized the need to remain efficient and competitive in an address last fall, foreshadowing the bureau’s establishment. His plan to “modernize American diplomacy” rests on five key pillars: expanding expertise in areas like global health and climate change, encouraging intra-department communications, promoting diversity of talent, upgrading technological capabilities, and “reinvigorating” traditional diplomacy and public engagement. The massive reorganization of the State Department, and how it handles the challenges of the next century, will be Secretary Blinken’s legacy.\n\nThe modernizations of diplomacy come at a time when digital presence and capability are becoming increasingly important to international relations. Corporations rely on information technology to conduct trans-national business, leading to a more globalized economy. Interdependence facilitated by technology leads to worldwide economic growth, but carries security risks. For example, supply chain attacks occur when a third party uses technological vulnerabilities in the supply chain to access a target organization’s confidential business information. According to one security firm, the vast majority of data breaches are linked to this type of attack. Such risks can affect not only multinational corporations but also any American business that utilizes the internet or other communication technologies.\n\nCyberattacks can target American economic interests both at home and abroad. They can be performed by anyone, from lone criminals to trained groups working for hostile governments. The Department of Justice alleges that hackers from Russia’s Federal Security Service—the child organization of the KGB—performed a myriad of attacks on American networks between 2012 and 2017.\n\nModern advancements, and especially the internet, change the way international conflicts develop. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine highlighted the role that the internet plays in modern warfare. Like corporations, government and military infrastructure are at risk of cyberattacks. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, cyber operations have been involved against media and security networks of both governments. But these operations are not launched just from Kiev and Moscow. In one case that went particularly viral, the hacker group Anonymous replaced a state-censored television channel with footage of the war, in order to inform Russian citizens of the conflict.\n\nThrough social media, the internet has also had the power to involve the hearts and minds of the whole world in the war. Content like President Volodymyr Zelensky’s appearance at the Grammys on Sunday, and Twitter videos of Russian missiles targeting residential neighborhoods has succeeded in garnering sympathy and support for Ukraine. Everyone is involved, and in real time.\n\nBoth President Biden and Secretary Blinken recognize that, because of technology, international affairs in the 21st century will be defined by its decentralization. Modernizing the State Department via the CDP bureau and other initiatives is central to America’s readiness to handle it.',

#  {'title': '4 Cybersecurity Risks & Tips for Remote Working in 2022',
#   'text': 'Working from home has become considerably popular in the aftermath of the pandemic. Even after the pandemic has passed, many experts believe that remote working will continue to be popular in a variety of industries.\n\nWhile working from home offers numerous advantages, it also exposes individuals and enterprises to a variety of cybersecurity dangers. As a result, it is critical to give home cybersecurity serious consideration. Most cybersecurity work-from-home threats can be readily mitigated by using a few simple Cybersecurity tips.\n\nCompanies that hire remote employees and engineers must keep them up to speed on cybersecurity rules and practices by providing frequent training and testing. Refreshers should be necessary at least twice a year, according to studies.\n\nCertain cybersecurity dangers, such as phishing, have become more frequent as a result of the surge in remote working. One of the main issues is that, in most offices, an IT staff will be in charge of cybersecurity. With a distributed workforce working from home, employees must be more aware of the risks of cybersecurity.\n\nHere are some of the best remote working cybersecurity tips to help keep you and your employees safe while working from home.\n\nStart using antivirus and internet security software at home.\n\nInvesting in a complete antivirus package for you and your staff is one of the most effective security safety nets to incorporate while working from home.\n\nAccording to sources, the global damage of cybercrime to enterprises is estimated to be over $1.5 billion per year. As hackers try to acquire access to sensitive files through people’s home internet networks and company VPNs, this number is only going to rise.\n\nYou, your company, and your employees could be vulnerable to ransomware, DDoS assaults, malware, spyware, and other forms of breaches as a result of these attacks.\n\nAntivirus suites do the heavy lifting for you by providing automatic remote work security against a variety of dangers, including:\n\nZero-day attacks (viruses taking advantage of security flaws before they are patched)\n\nMalware, spyware, and viruses\n\nTrojans and worms\n\nPhishing scams, including those sent via email\n\nA complete antivirus suite can not only defend against up to 100% of online security threats, but it can also automatically update itself to keep up with any new and emerging dangers.\n\nIt also works quietly in the background of your other operations so that you won’t be aware of the effort it’s putting in.\n\n2- Consider investing in a webcam cover.\n\nWorking from home mostly translates to participating in teleconferences and video chats, which demand the usage of your webcam. Unfortunately, malicious hackers can simply gain access to your webcam without your permission, putting your privacy at risk. Worse, if you have sensitive documents in your real workstation, hackers may be able to see them through your webcam.\n\nIf your webcam is not connected to your device, you should unplug it while not in use. If your webcam is built-in, you need to take extra precautions to protect yourself because a webcam attack might happen at any time.\n\nSliding webcam covers come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors to meet your specific demands. Most come with an adhesive layer that fits around your webcam, making them simple to install.\n\nIf your video conferencing software allows it, you might want to employ features like “blur backdrop” if it’s available. This can keep others in your meetings from spying on objects in your home’s background, which could contain sensitive information about you or your clients.\n\n3. Use a VPN\n\nConnecting your computer to the company’s Virtual Private Network (VPN connection) is a very common practice when working remotely, but this can open up new home office security ‘back doors’ that hackers could use.\n\nFirst of all, it’s critical to provide employees with work-from-home security advice and guidance, as well as policies on how to be a safe remote worker. Companies should seek out help in order to improve the security of their VPN.\n\nVPN security can easily be improved by using the most robust possible authentication method. Many VPNs employ usernames and passwords, but you might want to consider switching to the usage of smart cards. You can also improve your VPN encryption mechanism by switching from a Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol to a Layer Two Tunneling Protocol.\n\nMany VPNs require usernames and passwords, but you should consider switching to smart cards instead. Switching from a Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol to a Layer Two Tunneling Protocol can also improve your VPN encryption process.\n\n4- Secure your home Wi-Fi\n\nStrengthening the security of your home Wi-Fi network is one of the simplest ways to assure cybersecurity for remote workers. You may accomplish this by following a few simple steps.\n\nRather than depending on the router’s default password, create a strong, unique password. You can update the password on your router’s settings page by typing “192.168.1.1” into your browser.\n\nMake sure to pick a password that is difficult for others to guess. On the same settings page, you can alter your SSID or wireless network name to make it more difficult for third parties to identify and access your home Wi-Fi network. Use nothing that could be used to identify you, such as your name or home address.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe majority of the employees are working from home even now. And not every employee knows the know-how about cyber security, which can put the company’s data at risk. However, it doesn’t need to be done on purpose, but they can fall victim to a hacker’s doing. Therefore, the smart thing would be to hire a software engineer and have them build a program for you that will protect your employee’s from cyber attacks.\n\nHiring the best engineer for the job can be time-consuming and daunting, which is why you should consider having a match-making company to do the task for you. For example, you can reach out to companies such as Gaper.io. Their great reputation and customer reviews are enough to vouch for their quality match-making services between software engineers and companies.',

#  {'title': 'GUEST ESSAY: Here’s why ‘purple team’ mock attacks trumps traditional ‘red team’ assaults',
#   'text': 'Purple teaming is a way to use red teaming to understand and improve your defensive posture. Militaries improve operations through wargames. In the 1820s, the Prussian military labeled the two teams for this as “red” and “blue,” with red traditionally associated with the attackers, while blue represented the defender.\n\nRelated: Deploying human sensors\n\nWith increased dependence on computers, the military applied this war-gaming concept and color scheme to cyber. It became clear that the blue team could benefit from a more collaborative relationship with red, leading to the creation of “purple teaming.”\n\nThis collaboration is the key ingredient to successful purple teaming. The blue team decides on specific threats they want to test themselves against and the red team emulates those threats. The red team helps the blue team understand what’s working – and what they’re missing – by sharing information about their actions. By seeing blue team’s defenses, the red team can modify their attack to help highlight defensive gaps relative to real threats.\n\nMarshaling defenses\n\nWhile traditional red teaming often aims to motivate a network owner to take the threat seriously and identify vulnerabilities, purple teaming focuses on illuminating exactly what actions defenders must take to effectively mitigate or respond to the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of real adversaries. This allows cyber defenders to gain valuable insight about what realistic malicious TTPs will look like in their network and how they are impacted by existing defenses.\n\nThe entire process is a much more collaborative effort to truly understand how the current defenses are working and where improvements can be made.With increased communication, defenders can confidently and rapidly design, test, and tune new defenses to keep pace with the constantly evolving threat landscape.\n\nAlthough it’s still somewhat of a niche practice, there’s a great opportunity to provide defenders more resources to effectively defend their organizations through purple teaming. Also, implementing it on a regular cadence – weekly, monthly, or quarterly – can be beneficial. This way, it’s a regular part of security operations and the industry will see more cases where the first targeted organization detects and stops an attack.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits provided by purple teaming is that it leads to meaningful and actionable insight for the defenders. It clearly shows them their current posture, both strengths and weaknesses, against real-world TTPs to see what is and isn’t working to make the appropriate modifications.\n\nThe red team can now emulate a known threat that the defenders are very likely to encounter and the blue team will now have known malicious activity in their data to validate that their mitigations and detections will work.\n\nIt’s like a scientific experiment, where teams can repeatedly control and update each variable until the desired outcome is achieved.\n\nFlexibility is essential\n\n\n\nHowever, there are a couple challenges associated with implementing purple teaming. For example, there’s often a psychological challenge associated with purple teaming. It’s human nature to always want to “win,” but in the case of purple teaming, the red team can’t be preoccupied with getting the best of defenders. Both sides need to ensure they’re using a repeatable and intelligible process that can mitigate this challenge.\n\nTeams also must be flexible enough with their plan to achieve what the blue team is trying to accomplish, and clearly communicate what TTPs were used in the event. This means that organizations need a red team that understands real adversary TTPs.\n\nOften, the events detected by the blue team are consequences of the red team actions, but not the actions themselves. The red team and blue team must work together to bridge this gap to check if the blue team detections are connected to the red team actions.\n\nSince cyber operations can often be the most appealing approach for criminals to achieve their goals, one of the best ways to fight back is to hit them where it really counts: their wallets. With a threat-informed approach to defense that includes the benefits of purple teaming, defenders have the potential to make cyber intrusions cost more than they’re worth to adversaries.\n\nAbout the essayist: Steve Luke is Director of Training and Certification, MITRE ATT&CK Defender.\n\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from The Last Watchdog authored by bacohido.

#  {'title': 'Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s Regular Press Conference on April 7, 2022',
#   'text': 'Xinhua News Agency: A protocol on upgrading the free trade agreement (FTA) between China and New Zealand officially came into effect today. It is widely shared that this step will help the two economies recover in the post-COVID era and promote high-quality development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation. Can you offer more specifics?\n\nZhao Lijian: We are glad about and satisfied with the official entry into force of the protocol on upgrading the free trade agreement (FTA) between China and New Zealand and extend our congratulations. I want to stress the following:\n\nFirst, the protocol is a high-standard free trade agreement that is concluded on the basis of the China-New Zealand FTA and conforms to modern international economic and trade rules. It covers a wide range of market access and regulation issues and further improves the quality and efficiency of China-New Zealand trade and economic cooperation on top of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This will provide strong support for the two countries to deepen two-way trade and investment and consolidate cooperation in industrial and supply chains.\n\nSecond, uncertainties are clearly on the rise at the moment, given the flare-ups of COVID-19, the sluggish world economy and more volatile international situation. The entry into force of the upgrade protocol is conducive to deepening economic and trade cooperation between China and New Zealand, producing dividends of policies for high-level opening up and benefiting more companies and consumers of the two countries. Besides, it demonstrates the two countries’ firm resolve in supporting multilateralism and free trade with real actions, and helps to maintain stability of the international industrial and supply chains. It will thus become a model for other countries and play a positive role in cooperating against COVID-19, supporting multilateralism and free trade, and promoting stability and recovery of the world economy.\n\nThird, the China-New Zealand FTA is the first free trade agreement China has ever signed with any developed country. The China-New Zealand FTA was signed and entered into force in 2008, and the negotiations on its upgrading started in 2016 and were completed in 2019. And now, the upgrade protocol begins to take effect. This whole process fully demonstrates that the relations and cooperation between China and New Zealand have set an example of win-win cooperation between countries with different systems, at different development stages and of different economic sizes. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and New Zealand. Under the strategic guidance of the important consensus reached by leaders of the two countries, China is ready to work with New Zealand to carry forward the spirit of “striving to be the first”, jointly implement the upgraded FTA with high quality, strengthen dialogue, enhance mutual trust, deepen cooperation and properly handle differences, so as to add new dimensions to the China-New Zealand comprehensive strategic partnership, and make positive contributions to regional and global peace, stability, development and prosperity.\n\nCCTV: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on April 6 that the US has the ability and resolve to use sanctions against China as it has against Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine if Beijing “invades” Taiwan. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on the same day that Beijing should take away the right lessons from the coordinated Western response over Ukraine that any moves by China to take Taiwan by force would not be acceptable. Do you have any comment?\n\nZhao Lijian: There is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. The Taiwan question is an issue left over from the civil war in China. The means of its resolution is China’s internal affair, where no foreign country has any right to interfere. The Chinese people’s resolve and will to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering. We will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and efforts. That being said, we reserve the option of taking all necessary measures in response to the interference of foreign forces and the secessionist activities of a handful of “Taiwan independence” separatists.\n\nCurrently there is a new wave of tension across the Taiwan Strait. The root cause is that the authorities in Taiwan keep pushing for the independence agenda by soliciting US support and that some in the US attempt to use Taiwan to contain China. The two sides have been colluding with each other. A few people even deliberately draw an analogy between Taiwan and Ukraine despite their completely different nature in an attempt to confuse public opinion and profit from the chaos. This is playing with fire. Those who play with fire are bound to get burned themselves.\n\nChina Daily: According to reports, with the mediation of regional countries including Sudan and relevant international and regional mechanisms, main political parties in South Sudan have recently reached agreement on transitional security arrangements and signed a deal. Does China have any comment?\n\nZhao Lijian: Main political parties in South Sudan have recently reached agreement on transitional security arrangements and signed a deal. This is yet another important step forward in South Sudan’s peace process. China welcomes it. We appreciate the positive role played by Sudan and other neighboring countries as well as relevant international and regional mechanisms in bringing about this outcome. It is hoped that parties in South Sudan will earnestly implement the agreement, make solid progress in the political transition process and realize enduring peace and stability.\n\nBloomberg: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi apparently plans to visit Taiwan on Sunday after her trip to Japan. This will be the first visit to Taiwan by a holder of the Speaker’s office in 25 years. Does the foreign ministry have a comment on this?\n\nZhao Lijian: China resolutely opposes all forms of official contact between the US and Taiwan. Congress is a branch of the US government and should stringently abide by the one-China policy that the US upholds. If Speaker Pelosi visits Taiwan, this would gravely violate the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-US Joint Communiqués, seriously undermine China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, severely impact the political foundation of China-US relations and send a seriously wrong signal to “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. China firmly opposes this and has lodged solemn representations with the US side.\n\nThe US should abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués, immediately cancel Speaker Pelosi’s plan to visit Taiwan, stop official contact with Taiwan, and fulfill its commitment of not supporting “Taiwan independence” with real actions. If the US insists on having its own way, China will take firm and strong measures to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. All possible consequences that arise from this will completely be borne by the US side.\n\nCRI: According to reports, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany in Brussels on April 6 to discuss that Iran would never acquire a nuclear weapon. They agreed that “a diplomatic solution entailing a mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA is the best outcome, but noted that we are prepared for other scenarios if necessary”. What is China’s comment?\n\nZhao Lijian: The negotiations on reviving compliance with the JCPOA have entered the final stage. All parties have reached consensus on most of the text of the compliance resumption agreement with a few items yet to be resolved.\n\nChina believes that there is no better alternative to the JCPOA. At this final phase, it is ever more important that all parties boost confidence, step up diplomatic efforts, facilitate a smooth conclusion of the negotiations and avoid letting previous efforts come to naught. As the culprit of the Iranian nuclear crisis, the US should make political decisions as soon as possible and actively respond to the legitimate concerns of the Iranian side.\n\nChina will continue to participate in negotiations constructively, help bring the JCPOA back to the normal track at an early date, uphold the international non-proliferation system and promote peace and stability in the Middle East.\n\nAl Jazeera: Afghanistan’s mining ministry says that an agreement has been signed with the Metallurgical Corp of China to resume operations in Afghanistan’s largest copper mine the Mes Aynak. My question is this: following this agreement, the recent Afghanistan summit in China and meetings with Taliban officials, does this mean that China officially recognizes the new government in Afghanistan?\n\nZhao Lijian: I noted that you mentioned the progress on the Afghan issue. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the Third Foreign Ministers’ Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan and a series of related meetings in Tunxi, Anhui Province at the end of last month. The coordination and cooperation mechanism among the neighbors of Afghanistan, since its launch last September, has endeavored to bring into play the strengths of neighboring countries, thus playing a constructive role in promoting the steady transition in Afghanistan. All parties spoke highly of the relevant meetings. China will continue to work with Afghanistan’s neighboring countries to pitch in, build consensus, and coordinate and cooperate with each other to support the Afghan people in ushering in a brighter future.\n\nAs to your question on the recognition of the Afghan interim government, China’s position on relevant issues is consistent and clear-cut.\n\nHelsingin Sanomat: Finland is considering if it should apply to join NATO very soon. Russia’s attack on Ukraine changed dramatically Finland’s attitude toward NATO membership. China has earlier stated that China is against NATO’s enlargement. If Finland applies to join NATO soon, how will China react?\n\nZhao Lijian: First, I don’t answer hypothetical questions. China’s position on NATO’s eastward expansion is very clear. NATO was born out of the Cold War and should have long become a past tense. We advise relevant countries to exercise prudence in developing relations with NATO.\n\nHubei Media Group: The Preparatory Committee meeting for the 9th Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) was being held in Geneva these days. Russia said the US biomilitary activities in Ukraine have violated the BWC. The US accused Russia of spreading disinformation and called international criticism of US standing alone in opposing a BWC verification mechanism “revisionist history”. Do you have any comment?\n\nZhao Lijian: The US has conducted more biomilitary activities than any other countries and is the only country that opposes the establishment of a BWC verification mechanism in the world. The international community has long held grave concerns over this and the relevant issues remain the focus of the BWC meetings. At the second PrepCom this week, Russia made the accusation that the US’ biomilitary activities have violated the convention and raised explicit and specific concerns. Regrettably, the US has not directly responded to that yet. Instead, it just kept accusing Russia of spreading disinformation. Such practice in itself is not consistent with the stipulations of the convention. According to the BWC, the Russian side has the right to question the US’ compliance with the convention, and the US has the obligation to make clarifications, and the final judgment should be passed by the international community through assessment.\n\nAlso, I need to draw your attention to a basic fact. According to the working document the US submitted to the BWC Meeting of States Parties in November 2021, under the Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP), the US has 336 so-called cooperation facilities overseas, including 26 in Ukraine. However, the so-called Fact Sheet released by the US Department of Defense on March 11, 2022 claimed that there are 46 such facilities in Ukraine. Why did the number increase by 20 in just four months? Besides, there are mistakes in the above-mentioned working document, in which a country was listed mistakenly for twice. So the total number of “336” must be inaccurate, too. This gives good reason for the international community to raise doubt, but what reason is there for the US to refuse to make any clarifications and call that disinformation?\n\nI also noticed that the US cited “revisionist history” to describe the international community’s criticism over the US sole opposition to establishing a BWC verification mechanism. What an accusation! The US side even claimed that the resumption of Protocol negotiations should be “put behind” and “a new chapter” should be started. Such statement is shocking. It was the US’ abrupt announcement of unilateral withdrawal from the negotiations in July 2001 that let the outcomes of the seven-year negotiations go to waste and set off an uproar in the international community. At this PrepCom, the vast majority of countries, including US allies, called for the resumption of multilateral negotiations to establish a verification mechanism as soon as possible. The US was the only state that voiced opposition.\n\nA multilateral verification mechanism is characterized by fair and just entitlement of equal rights and obligations to all countries. But the US wants to arbitrarily accuse others of violating the convention and demands verification with “the presumption of guilt”, while refusing to accept any supervision and verification of its own compliance. This lies at the heart of the US’ sole opposition to a verification mechanism.\n\nThe BWC belongs to the international community. Bearing on international peace and security, compliance of the BWC cannot be casually defined by the US based on its double standards. As one of the BWC depository states, the US ought to be an example, not an exception, when it comes to compliance. We once again urge the US to give comprehensive and detailed clarification of its biomilitary activities and stop single-handedly opposing the establishment of a multilateral verification mechanism to restore the confidence of the international community in the US’ compliance.\n\nReuters: You just said that if US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan, China will respond with strong measures. What kind of strong measures will China respond with?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: I just made my point very clear. If this visit is made, China will take firm and strong measures in response. The ensuing consequences will be completely borne by the US.\n\nAl Jazeera: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he’s meeting or having talks with President Xi Jinping on Friday. Do we have any schedule or any details about this meeting?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: As to the arrangement of the meeting between Chinese and Philippine leaders, we will release information on a timely basis if there’s any.\n\nBeijing Youth Daily: Data recently released by the US Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) shows that drug overdose deaths in the US are surging. What is your comment?\n\nZhao Lijian: I have noted relevant reports. The drug problem in the US appears to be escalating. In the 12-month period ending in September 2021, about 104,000 Americans died due to a drug overdose. Back in 2015, the number was about 52,000. The US House of Representatives recently passed a legislation that would legalize marijuana nationwide. Some media commented that this marks another key step to legalize marijuana in the US. As drug proliferation is already a deep-seated problem in US society, this legislation may aggravate drug abuse in the country.\n\nDrug is a common enemy of humanity. We have been helping the US side to deal with it in a friendly and candid manner. China scheduled fentanyl-related substances as a class on May 1, 2019, which fully demonstrates our sincerity and support. Regrettably, with the most prominent fentanyl issue in the world, the US has not yet done the same. Even worse, the US sanctioned such important institutions responsible for testing and controlling fentanyl-related substances as the Institution of Forensic Science of the Ministry of Public Security and the National Narcotics Laboratory in China by adding them to the “entity list”.\n\nThe US should see fault in itself, permanently schedule fentanyl-related substances as a class and take practical and effective measures to reduce the demand for drugs. The last thing it should do is to constantly shift the blame and make accusations against other countries with the control of non-scheduled chemicals. It should immediately correct its mistakes, instead of asking for China’s cooperation on the one hand and sanctioning Chinese counter-narcotics bodies on the other.\n\nBloomberg: Suspected state-sponsored Chinese hackers have targeted the power sector in India in recent months as part of an apparent cyber espionage campaign, according to a threat intelligence firm Recorded Future. Does the foreign ministry have a comment on it?\n\nZhao Lijian: I noted relevant reports. We have reiterated many times that China firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks in accordance with law. We will never encourage, support or condone cyber attacks. Given the virtual nature of cyberspace and the fact that there are all kinds of online actors who are difficult to trace, it’s important to have complete and sufficient evidence when investigating and identifying cyber-related incidents. One should be all the more prudent when associating cyberattacks with the government of a certain country. As is known to all, the US is the world’s largest source of cyber attacks and "hacking empire". A piece of advice to the relevant company that you just mentioned: if they really care about global cyber security, they should pay more attention to the cyber attacks by the US government-sponsored hackers on China and other countries, and do more to promote dialogue and cooperation among countries, rather than sow discord and sling mud at China under the pretext of cyberattack issues.\n\nAFP: China has denied it has any plans to set up a military base in the Solomon Islands. But Australian media have found an official letter where such a deal was discussed in 2020 between a Chinese state-owned company and a former official in the island. Do you have any comment on this?\n\nZhao Lijian: Recently, we have shared with you the information on China-Solomon Islands security cooperation and expounded on our position on many occasions. As for the groundless attacks and smearing of China by certain Australian media, they are deliberately creating tension in the region. Their reports have also fully exposed their Cold War mentality and ideological bias. China is firmly opposed to this.\n\nThe Paper: A few days ago, the Afghan interim government announced a nationwide ban on poppy cultivation and the manufacturing, use and sales of all categories of narcotics. Does China have any comment?\n\nZhao Lijian: China appreciates the measures taken by the Afghan interim government. Narcotics is a common scourge of mankind. The Chinese government firmly cracks down on narcotics crimes and actively participates in international counter-narcotics cooperation. We stand ready to further deepen counter-narcotics cooperation with Afghanistan and other regional countries to safeguard the healthy and tranquil life of all our peoples.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the US, the culprit of the Afghan issue, played an ignominious role in the narcotics problem in Afghanistan by acquiescing or even participating in drugs production and trade there. According to some media reports, the US forces stationed in Afghanistan implemented a project to create a drug laboratory on a global scale. As a result, the production of opiates in the country increased more than 40 times. Alfred McCoy, an American historian, said in an article that to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, the US generously funded local guerrillas through the CIA, turning a blind eye to the fact that they were operating a chain of heroin laboratories. Charles Cogan, former director of the CIA’s Afghan operation, said that the US didn’t really devote resources to an investigation of the drug trade in Afghanistan.\n\nThe two decades of US presence in Afghanistan is two decades of death and displacement of innocent Afghan civilians and two decades of unchecked local drug proliferation. With its irresponsible and hasty withdrawal, the US has left behind a series of grim challenges to the innocent Afghan people, including the drug issue. The US should reflect on its behavior, offer sincere apologies and ample compensations, and strive to undo the harm it has inflicted on the Afghan people with concrete actions.\n\nReuters: Considering the epidemic situation in China, is China considering approving the use of foreign vaccines in China?\n\nZhao Lijian: I would refer you to the competent authorities for questions related to the application, approval and market authorization of foreign vaccines in China.\n\nBeijing Daily: Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and European Council President Charles Michel held a trilateral meeting in Brussels the other day. The Azerbaijani and Armenian sides agreed to convene by the end of April a Joint Border Commission whose mandate will be to delimit the border between them. The Azerbaijani and Armenian leaders also instructed Ministers of Foreign Affairs to work on the preparation of a peace treaty. Does China have any comment?\n\nZhao Lijian: Azerbaijan and Armenia are both China’s friendly cooperative partners. We are glad to see the two sides resolving differences and disagreements through dialogue and consultation. It is our sincere hope that both sides will implement the ceasefire consensus to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region and tranquility for the people.',

#  {'title': 'DHS, CISA must better coordinate with stakeholders to protect critical infrastructure',
#   'text': 'Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., has questioned the efficacy of voluntary cybersecurity relationships between government and industry as the GAO calls for CISA to complete its post 2018 evolution and build on previous efforts to bring other stakeholders into the process when developing programs and regulations. ("Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY)" by Talk Media News Archived Galleries is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security must further lean into its role protecting critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, but first it must work to finish its post 2018 evolution and build on previous efforts to bring other stakeholders into the process when developing programs and regulations.\n\nThat was the primary conclusion from a Government Accountability Office report released this week ahead of a House oversight hearing on how the federal government, DHS and its digital security wing the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are moving to protect critical infrastructure from state-backed and criminal cyberattacks.\n\nThe findings build off previous GAO investigations, including a more comprehensive report on DHS and CISA\'s efforts released last month.\n\nDuring an oversight hearing Wednesday, Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., who chairs the House Homeland Security subcommittee on cybersecurity and infrastructure protection, provided the latest example of how Congress has broadly shifted its thinking on cybersecurity regulations. She noted that in previous stint as subcommittee chair during the Obama administration, cybersecurity proponents in Congress helped lay the groundwork for the largely voluntary relationship between agencies responsible for regulating cybersecurity requirements within critical infrastructure.\n\nToday, she and others are far more willing to consider a heavier regulatory hand to ensure companies are following minimum security standards and reducing the likelihood that a breach or ransomware attack could have far-reaching consequences throughout the supply chain or IT ecosystem.\n\n“With all due respect to the hard work that’s been done, I think it’s time to be candid about the limits of these voluntary partnerships and authorities,” Clarke said this week.\n\nCISA\'s growing pains taking lead federal cyber role\n\nPart of that job, according to the GAO, will involve completing activities that are leftover from CISA’s transition from the National Protection and Programs Directorate, an agency that was in many respects reliant on DHS headquarters for authorities and resources, into the operational component agency that it is today.\n\nThat transformation, enacted by legislation in 2018, included mandates to overhaul CISA’s organizational structure and create separate divisions for cybersecurity, infrastructure security and communications.\n\nMost of those tasks have been completed, but the agency has yet to finalize its mission-essential functions or complete workforce planning. The latter task takes on more relevance when you observe that CISA has spent the past few years heavily pushing the message that government, industry schools are not doing enough to develop a sufficient pipeline of cyber talent.\n\nThere’s also evidence in the GAO report that the agency has experienced some growing pains over the past five years as it has morphed from an afterthought agency to the federal government’s primary vehicle for outreach to the private sector and critical infrastructure and now one that wields increasingly powerful regulatory tools for the private sector and the rest of government.\n\nAuditors identified “a number of challenges that selected government and private sector stakeholders had noted when coordinating with CISA, including a lack of clarity surrounding its organizational changes and the lack of stakeholder involvement in developing guidance.”\n\nAgency officials have spoken before about some early stumbles as they worked through how to best use and apply new authorities to issue binding and emergency cybersecurity directives to civilian agencies. More recently, CISA has gained the ability to demand administrative subpoenas from private internet service providers for ownership information on vulnerable IT assets and compel incident reporting on breaches and ransomware payments from critical infrastructure entities.\n\nWhile the agency often receives praise for its engagement and collaborative spirit with the private sector and other agencies, there are critics.\n\nFor example, in recent years CISA updated its process for prioritizing cybersecurity assistance to different sectors when it developed a list of national critical functions — or services and processes where a cyber or physical attack could have significant impact and disrupt operations more broadly across one or multiple industrial sectors.\n\nIt was meant to replace an older process, the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program, a relic of the agency’s NPPD days and one that was designed to focus primarily on physical, isolated threats and allow for smarter prioritization of limited federal resources and assistance. Despite the shift, just seven out of 25 critical infrastructure owners and operators interviewed by GAO were both aware and supportive of the list, with many saying they didn’t know about the framework or didn’t understand its goals.\n\nOddly, GAO said it has made 11 recommendations to DHS to address the problems but does not specify them in the report other than to say that DHS officials have committed to addressing them all by the end of 2022.\n\n“While the department has communicated to us that they are taking steps to implement our recommendations, we urge them to do so even more expeditiously to protect our economy, public health and safety and national security from any future attacks,” Tina Won Sherman, director of homeland security and justice at GAO, told lawmakers Wednesday.',

#   'text': 'New Delhi, Apr 7 (PTI) China launched "probing cyber attacks" on India\'s power grid in strategically located Ladakh thrice since December 2021 but did not succeed because safeguards were in place to thwart such intrusions, Union Power Minister R K Singh said on Thursday.\n\nAmid reports of Chinese state-sponsored hackers targeting the power grid, the Ministry of External Affairs asserted India has systems in place to safeguard critical infrastructure.\n\nAccording to the reports, the hackers targeted seven Indian state centres responsible for carrying out electrical dispatch and grid control near a border area contested by the two nuclear neighbours.\n\nThe group reportedly used the trojan ShadowPad, which is believed to have been developed by contractors for China\'s Ministry of State Security, leading to the conclusion that it was a state-sponsored hacking effort.\n\nAsked about the reports at a media briefing here, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, "We have seen the reports. There is a mechanism in place so that our critical infrastructure remains resilient in such cases...We have systems in place to safeguard critical infrastructure."\n\nResponding to a question by journalists, Bagchi, however, added cryptically, "I don\'t have any information that we have raised the issue with China."\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of a clean energy ministerial meet in the national capital, Power Minister R K Singh acknowledged attempts were made by China, but added India\'s defences against such intrusions were strong.\n\n"Our defence against cyber attack is strong. These were probing attacks in December, January and February. They did not succeed. But we are aware," he said.\n\nThe minister also said action was taken way back in 2018 against suspected cyber attacks on the country\'s power supply system.\n\n"We had put protocols in place. Those protocols are working and we are strengthening those protocols every day. So, our cyber defence against cyber attack is strong. We are confident about that," Singh asserted.\n\nMeanwhile, in Beijing, Chinese government denied reports that its hackers targeted the Indian power grid in Ladakh.\n\n"We have noted the relevant reports," China\'s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a media briefing on Thursday.\n\nHe was responding to a query about a report by private intelligence firm \'Recorded Future\' on Wednesday that claimed suspected Chinese hackers targeted the Indian power grid in an apparent espionage campaign.\n\n"As I repeated many times, we firmly oppose and crack down on all forms of hacking activities. We will never encourage, support or condone such activities," he said. PTI ASK ASK\n\nSK',

#  {'title': 'Address Your Compliance “Tail Risks” Now',
#   'text': 'Now is the time to shore up your compliance risk management programs. Otherwise, the likelihood and severity of violations and enforcement could increase significantly. Just last week, Acting U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, rightly warned of the need to strengthen your risk management programs due to the Russia / Ukraine war and other “tail risks,” which are defined as unlikely but highly impactful risk events. Tail risks have often included geopolitical risk, cyber risk, inflation and rate risk, asset price risk, and recession risk. Acting Comptroller Hsu pointed out that not only have the likelihoods for each tail risk increased, but different tail risk events may be linked and materialize simultaneously. He stated that these tail risks warrant “greater caution and risk management vigilance … perhaps more than any time in recent memory.”\n\nActing Comptroller Hsu’s warning is particularly timely in view of the multiple risks unfolding currently, including the continuing and potentially expanding Russia – Ukraine war; heightened / emboldened cybercrimes, and other geo-political and economic storm clouds ahead made up of global inflation, supply chain shortages, and overall stress in the markets.\n\nActing Comptroller Hsu, in coordination with his European and global regulatory counterparts, underscored the need to refresh enterprise risk management processes, stress testing under new and emerging scenarios.\n\nIn this regard, don’t forget your compliance and ethics risks. And keep in mind that these tail risks and the need for urgency to upgrade your compliance and ethics risk management program extends across ALL industries, not just financial services.\n\nFor example:\n\nIncreased cyber-attacks threaten your clients’, company’s, and employees’ confidential data. This can happen at any time and across multiple industries and geographies. A breach against your company or even one of your competitors can prompt a chain reaction of payments, governance, and media inquiries, and an operational and communications nightmare. Are your cyber desk-top exercises really “fit-for-the-ever-changing-purpose” world? Have you refreshed not only your business impact analyses and risk assessments, but also extended it to anticipate and address collateral consequences from a compliance risk perspective?\n\nYour growing crypto trading and banking business might lead to unknowing OFAC, EU or other regulatory sanctions evasion, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and The Wall Street Journal . Have you refreshed, let alone, created a crypto compliance risk assessment?\n\nDo you really know your UBOs (ultimate beneficial owners) – especially if IP addresses are hacked or manipulated? Don’t be surprised if enemy states or agents of such are moving their ownership interests into non-sanctioned countries, entities, or shell companies. If you are a correspondent bank, or a respondent bank with other banks as your clients, do you really know your customers’ customers’ customers? Are your payments filtering truly working in a timely and refreshed manner? What is your “bench strength” to always keep your operations and compliance teams ready, like having 2-3 lines of a fast-moving ice hockey team / game. The ice these days is quite slippery!\n\nTherefore, DO THE FOLLOWING:\n\nRefresh your compliance risk assessments and controls If they are annual – consider monthly or at least quarterly, targeted updates to validate that your documented inherent risks, control effectiveness and especially residual risks have not hit “red” into the high and trending higher risk categories. Have your teams on call to parachute into operationally risky businesses and regions to prevent and detect violations of law and regulation – beyond sanctions and especially around misconduct against consumers, markets, and communities.\n\nRe-look and refresh your overall KYC, surveillance, and sanctions compliance programs – are they really working? In my previous blog, “Is Your Russia–Ukraine and Overall Sanctions Compliance Program Really Working? (Don’t Find Out the Hard Way)”, I outline how you and your company should be benchmarking and adapting continuously against leading- and expected compliance practices.\n\nDon’t put all your resources into one region – “read across” your other regions, products, clients and think ahead for emerging risks Know your regulators – work and dialogue with them to demonstrate your due diligence to refresh your compliance and ethics risk management program across your organization. Demonstrate that these tail risks can lull management into a false sense of security – but will your firm withstand a false sense of cyber- and financial crime security? Keep your CEO and your board informed of your firm’s increased compliance and ethics residual risks — because your inherent risks have certainly increased, including tail risks. What was low last year might be inherently high this year. Your controls of yesterday, therefore might not be effective any longer. Has your “enforcement risk” grown exponentially because you have not refreshed your compliance risk management program? Have you stress tested your controls to see if they will be effective if different tail risk events are linked and materialize simultaneously?\n\nThese are just a sample of open questions to consider. If you can’t answer these questions, then take action to get the answers. If you don’t have the bandwidth to conduct frequent compliance risk assessments, engage an outside expert to help. In the long run, completing these tasks and reviews now can help you keep from running afoul of regulations and the potential for costly fines.',

#  {'title': 'Pacific Institute Water Conflict Chronology Updated',
#   'text': 'Appreciatively, we acknowledge the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment & Security for the sheer depth and width of its work. Its records of necessity offer a constant focus towards egalitarian access to essential resources and documentation of lack of worldwide access to water. And thus to life.\n\nWater nurtures all life, inconceivably miraculous for the most vivid and hidden of human needs. It reaches places nothing else will as it hydrates and sustains. It is an all-encompassing necessity. Nothing matters if one is lacking water. Life, as we know it on our blue planet, would disappear.\n\nThe failure to meet basic human needs for #water contributes to the tensions over access to water, especially during droughts and extreme events. The updated Water Conflict Chronology details why and what can be done about it: https://t.co/myqqUqfRhq #ClimateChange #conflict — Pacific Institute (@PacificInstitut) March 27, 2022\n\nPacific Institute Water Conflict Chronology Updated\n\nRepublished from Pacific Institute, ”Dedicated to providing information and resources to help protect and preserve fresh water around the globe.”\n\nBy Dr. Peter H. Gleick, Pacific Institute Senior Fellow & Co-Founder\n\nViolence over water resources continues to worsen.\n\nIn the past few years, severe droughts in India and Iran have led to a big increase in conflicts over access to irrigation and domestic water and to demonstrations against water diversions from one community to another. The violence and war between Russia and Ukraine that worsened in 2014 and expanded again with the Russian invasion just a few weeks ago have included attacks on civilian water systems and the use of water as a weapon. Growing population pressures combined with worsening ethnic and religious conflict in sub-Saharan Africa continue to lead to hundreds of deaths a year from violence between pastoralists and farmers over scarce water resources. And computerized water systems are experiencing growing cyberattacks that threaten water safety, quality, and reliability.\n\nThese are just some of the findings of the newly released update of the Water Conflict Chronology, the most comprehensive open-source database on water-related violence, from the Pacific Institute. The Pacific Institute has been compiling and maintaining data on water conflicts since the late 1980s, and the latest update, released in mid-March 2022, brings the number of events to over 1,300, going as far back as the earliest known water war, in ancient Mesopotamia, 4,500 years ago.\n\nThe Water Conflict Chronology outlines how violence over water takes three forms.\n\nTrigger: Access to and control of water can be a “ trigger ” for violence, such as the demonstrations and riots in Iran in 2019, 2020, and 2021 over the diversion of water away from the Zayanderud river in the city of Isfahan, and growing numbers of killings over access to irrigation water in India and Pakistan during severe droughts.\n\nWeapon: Water and water systems can be “ weapons ” of violence, such as when armed groups in Libya cut off water to Tripoli by attacking water pumping stations, or when Israeli settlers flooded Palestinian olive groves with sewage in 2019, or when the FBI in the United States arrested neo-Nazis for plotting to poison water supplies in an effort to ignite violence in 2020.\n\nCasualty: Water and water systems can be “ casualties ” of violence when they are attacked during conflicts that may start for other reasons. Yemen’s civilian water infrastructure has been repeatedly attacked during the war there. Israeli settlers and military have reportedly destroyed a wide range of Palestinian agricultural irrigation systems, water tanks, and water sources over the past three years. Egyptian hackers launched a cyber-attack on Ethiopian water systems in June 2020 in opposition to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, and that same year Israel reported several cyber-attacks on Israeli water infrastructure. Water tanks, dams, and water utility equipment have all been attacked in recent incidents around the world.\n\nThese incidents are on the increase. Figure 1 shows the number of entries by year since 2000, broken out by the type of conflict or violence. As the data show, the number of incidents has been increasing, dominated by water as a trigger of violence, with a substantial number of entries where water and water systems have been casualties or targets of violence.\n\nThe data in the Chronology also point to both the importance of reducing violence associated with freshwater, and to identifying strategies that might be effective. Among the most important tools for reducing water conflicts would be accelerating efforts to meet the Human Right to Water, declared by the United Nations in 2010, and to provide basic safe water and sanitation for everyone – an objective of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. The failure to meet basic human needs for water contributes to the tensions over access to water, especially during droughts and extreme events. Strategies to enhance and enforce protection of civilian water infrastructure during war, including existing international laws of war such as the Geneva Convention and its 1977 Protocols, could reduce the intentional targeting of water systems during conflicts. Diplomatic efforts should also be ramped up to help resolve disputes over shared international water systems and over rights to water and land, such as the longstanding conflicts in Africa between pastoralists and farmers.\n\nFinally, the growing threat of human-caused climate change is already worsening water conditions around the world, deepening droughts, enhancing flooding, and disrupting water infrastructure. A key strategy to reduce the risk of water conflicts around the world must also include efforts to slow and eventually stop climate change and to reduce the severity and extent of now unavoidable impacts on water.\n\nFresh water is a vital resource, necessary for all aspects of a sustainable future, including meeting basic human and ecosystem needs and providing the goods and services all societies want. Unless strategies for moving from water conflict to water cooperation are pursued and implemented, violence associated with freshwater resources seems likely to continue to increase. That’s not the path we want to be on.\n\nAlso see:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave a tip for CleanTechnica, want to advertise, or want to suggest a guest for our CleanTech Talk podcast?

#   'text': 'At least two attempts by Chinese hackers were made on electricity distribution centres near Ladakh but were not successful, Power Minister R.K. Singh said.\n\nAt least two attempts by Chinese hackers were made on electricity distribution centres near Ladakh but were not successful, Power Minister R.K. Singh said.\n\nThe Union government has confirmed reports that Chinese hackers continue to target Indian power plants, especially those close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) even as a U.S. based cyber security firm report claimed that Chinese State-sponsored actors have targeted seven power grid assets, the national emergency response system and an Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company since September 2021.\n\nAt least two attempts by Chinese hackers were made on electricity distribution centres near Ladakh but were not successful, Minister for Power R.K. Singh told reporters on Thursday . “We’ve already strengthened our defence system to counter such cyberattacks,” he said, without identifying whether the hackers identified had any links to the Chinese government.\n\nMEA says no information at present\n\nWhen asked about if the attacks that had been detected had been raised with China, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi remarked that the MEA had no information at present, but expressed confidence that India’s “critical infrastructure has adequate safeguard mechanisms.”\n\nSecurity firm Recorded Future said in a report released on April 6 that in recent months it had observed “likely network intrusions targeting at least 7 Indian State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) responsible for carrying out real-time operations for grid control and electricity dispatch within these respective States.”\n\nIt noted that the targeting had been geographically concentrated, with the identified SLDCs located in North India, in proximity to the India-China border in Ladakh. India and China have been engaged in a stand-off at multiple points along the undemarcated LAC in eastern Ladakh since April 2020.\n\nThe firm said it was temporarily clustering the activity of the group under the name Threat Activity Group-38 (TAG-38). “Since at least September 2021, we have observed TAG- 38 intrusions targeting the identified victim organizations. The group has employed probable compromised infrastructure for command and control of ShadowPad implants used to target the identified networks, as well as using the open source tool Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP).”\n\nTAG-38 likely compromised and coopted Internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices for command and control (C2) of Shadowpad malware and FRP.\n\nLimited economic espionage\n\nThe report stressed that prolonged targeting of Indian power grid assets by Chinese State-linked groups offered limited economic espionage or traditional intelligence-gathering opportunities. “We believe this targeting is instead likely intended to enable information gathering surrounding critical infrastructure systems or is pre-positioning for future activity.The objective for intrusions may include gaining an increased understanding into these complex systems in order to facilitate capability development for future use or gaining sufficient access across the system in preparation for future contingency operations,” it explained.\n\nThis is not the first time, Recorded Feature has flagged such cyber intrusions. In March 2021, the Massachusetts-based firm found that in the lead up to the Galwan clashes on June 15, 2020, where 20 Indian soldiers were killed, they noticed an increase in malware targeting the government, defence organisations and the public sector. It said that the intrusions started by Red Echo, a Chinese State sponsored group, started in May 2020 and continued throughout the year. The Power Ministry had then confirmed that while attempts to breach systems were made, the power sector had not been impacted. On March 3, 2021, Maharashtra’s Power Minister Nitin Raut announced that a State Cyber Cell probe had found ‘‘14 Trojan horses in the servers’‘ of the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company that had the potential to disrupt power distribution.\n\nOppose hacking: China\n\nReacting to the recent report by Recorded Future, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, “We have noted the relevant reports. As I repeated many times, we firmly oppose and crack down on all forms of hacking activities. We will never encourage, support or condone such activities.”\n\nHe stated that cyberspace had the feature that it was virtual and that there were many players, and in designating relevant cases, there should be enough evidence. “A lot of prudence is required in doing so. As is known to all, the U.S. is the empire of hacking. It has launched the most hacking activities in the world. I try to remind the relevant institution you mentioned, if it really cares about cybersecurity, it should pay more attention to the attacks launched by the U.S. against the Chinese companies and institutions. They should do more conducive that is to facilitate dialogue and cooperation among countries instead slinging mud at China.”',

#  {'title': 'Exclusive Talk with Toby Lewis, Global Head of Threat Analysis at Darktrace',
#   'text': 'Toby Lewis, Head of Threat Analysis Prior to joining Darktrace, Toby spent 15 years in the UK Government’s cyber security threats response unit, including as the UK National Cyber Security Centre’s Deputy Technical Director for Incident Management. He has specialist expertise in Security Operations, having worked across Cyber Threat Intelligence, Incident Management, and Threat Hunting. He has presented at several high-profile events, including the NCSC’s flagship conference, CyberUK, the SANS CyberThreat conference, and the Cheltenham Science Festival. He was a lead contributor to the first CyberFirst Girls Competition, championing greater gender diversity in STEM and cyber security. Toby is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and holds a Master’s in Engineering from the University of Bristol.\n\nQ1: Please tell us about your role at Darktrace. What made you excited to join the Darktrace team?\n\nToby: My role here at Darktrace is the Global Head of Threat Analysis. My day-to-day job involves looking at the 100 or so cybersecurity analysts we have spread from New Zealand to Singapore, the UK, and most major time zones in the US. My main role is to evaluate how we can use the Darktrace platform to work with our customers. How can we ensure that our customers get the most out of our cybersecurity expertise and support when using AI to secure their network?\n\nThe other half of my role at Darktrace is subject matter expertise. This role involves talking to reporters like yourself or our customers who want to hear more about what Darktrace can do to help them from a cybersecurity perspective, discussing the context of current events. That part of my role was born out of a nearly 20-year career in cybersecurity. I first started in government and was one of the founding members of the National Cybersecurity Center here in the UK. It was a natural progression to continue my career at Darktrace.\n\nLet’s get back to the original question of what excited me about joining them. Over the last 15+ years, I’ve worked in threat intel incident response, incident management, and anything to do with security operations. A lot of that work was very reactive. We had to wait for somebody to become compromised, and we would then spend time understanding what was going on. What did the attackers do? How did they get there? From an attacker’s perspective, we could garner all this great threat intelligence, and we could then share that threat intelligence with whomever we thought needed protecting. But there always had to be a sacrificial lamb. There always had to be somebody who had to get hit, somebody who had to be compromised first so you could learn from their misfortune.\n\nOne of the models that really excited me about Darktrace was the idea that it’s actually not fed by threat intelligence or knowledge of what attackers have done in the past. Using AI to learn about the defender’s environments, Darktrace protects against anything that doesn’t look like the defender (rather than what they think looks like an attacker). It is a powerful way of detecting things that have never been seen before, which was exciting for me.\n\nQ2: What are some of the biggest challenges companies face in terms of securing their organizations in 2022? How does Darktrace play a role?\n\nToby: There have been several competing things happening simultaneously. On the one hand, you have the increasing use of SaaS and the cloud. On the other hand, we have got this big thing called Covid. Even as people return to the office, I don’t think we will lose hybrid work or working from home.\n\nNetworks are no longer constrained to this tight, perimeter network that firewalls can secure. Your data is in the cloud, on some SaaS provider, or a third-party website. Fundamentally, you’re allowing your users to log in from home or over the internet. Across all these scenarios, your users can now access your data from wherever they are in the world. The trade-off is that if users can access your data from anywhere, so can an attacker. So, it becomes a question of how you would defend against that.\n\nHow would you change your cybersecurity posture from a very traditional, barbed wire fence methodology, focusing on defending the physical perimeter, to something that anybody with internet access can now have a go at penetrating the network? The big thing that we have seen is the power of credentials. Under the old model, that perimeter, a username, and a password alone would have sufficed. Now, with widespread internet access, it’s no longer enough. An attacker can take advantage of the fact that people use weak passwords, that they reuse passwords, and that those passwords get compromised and leaked online. When users are reusing the same password across multiple sites, and it gets leaked, many other accounts could fall prey and be impacted.\n\nFrom a Darktrace perspective, recognizing that credentials have become a powerful tool for an attacker’s arsenal, we need to start thinking about how to defend the network. When somebody logs on with a username and password, how do you know they are whom they say? You have mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA), but MFA isn’t a silver bullet. It’s not, “you have MFA, and therefore, all your security worries are over.” We know companies that construct MFA solutions still get targeted. We know there are weaknesses in some forms of MFA, such as SMS-based MFA, so we know that it can’t be a silver bullet.\n\nUsing something like Darktrace’s Self-Learning AI is helpful to understand users’ behaviors so that when somebody does log on, we can determine whether that’s an expected behavior based on how we have seen them operate before. Then when they gain access to the environment and begin to move around laterally, and access services, all of those data points provide us a point of comparison with what we know that user has done in the past. That allows us to detect those unusual local events without firing on a known bad IP address or known string of texts from a malware beacon.\n\nQ3: Can you comment on some of the cyber security breaches that took place in 2022? Ex: NVIDIA and Samsung\n\nToby: The NVIDIA breach was interesting because when it first struck, it was maybe a day or two after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and I think everyone was wondering, is this the retaliation? Is this the cyberwar that everyone has been predicting? NVIDIA is a strange place for a cyberwar to start, but was this what we expected to see? And then it transpired that it probably wasn’t anything to do with Russia at all.\n\nRansomware is an incident that I spent the last four or five years focused on, more so than any other incident. It felt like yet another ransomware attack occurred when we first saw it. But as the incident evolved and more information came out about it, it was interesting to note that maybe this wasn’t a ransomware attack. Maybe, the motivation wasn’t purely about getting financial information or a financial advantage through ransom payment. We saw threats of attackers publishing hidden source code online. We noticed strange demands: “If you do not meet these demands, we will publish your source code.” We saw demands around things like removing rate-limiting for crypto mining. Attackers demanded that if companies weren’t willing to do that, they should at least open source their drivers and software so that attackers could do it themselves.\n\nIt became one of the first attacks I have seen where it was not about trying to get a direct financial return. It was not about trying to have an ideological impact from a hacker activist perspective but getting a company to change its business practices. That said, there’s probably some financial gain further down the line in cryptomining using NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nQ4: Tell us about Darktrace’s self-learning AI. How does Darktrace use self-learning AI to stop cyber disruption?\n\nToby: Darktrace’s approach is very different from other cybersecurity companies. Our focus is not on learning about the attacker and the methods they might use but on learning about the defender and building an understanding of normal behaviors within that organization. Self-Learning AI is constantly evolving and learns ‘on the job.’\n\nWe learn about our customers, including how users interact with their devices, how devices interact with each other, and what technologies different users use, for example. On a more technical level, we’re connecting data points based on packets hitting our sensors or when an API integration collects a log event. Over time, we learn behaviors and build a unique data set for each customer’s environment – understanding what is normal and what isn’t. From there, we can enforce that normal. If there is something anomalous or malicious, we can easily identify those behaviors and notify security teams in real-time.\n\nOnce something has been promoted as suspicious, we can then start applying some degree of cybersecurity context over the top. We determine that this is unusual, but this looks like an admin account, and it looks like they are trying to interact with your domain controller. Some cybersecurity context emphasizes that this anomalous event might be more worrying than just a strange random event in your environment.\n\nThe key thing here is to focus not on the attackers but on the defenders. We build a very tight profile of what we understand about each of our customers because if there’s something alien to the environment – if the attacker is trying to get in or even an insider is trying to move around and access data they wouldn’t normally do – all that stands out from their normal behavior profile. Even if we didn’t know that they were mounting their attack from a known bad IP address, the behavior stands out compared to the other users in that environment. It’s certainly enough for us to believe that that activity is worth investigating.\n\nBecause self-learning AI has such a deep understanding of environments and normal behaviors, it can autonomously respond when something deviates from that normal. Darktrace’s response capability, Antigena, can quarantine devices until the human team can respond.\n\nQ5: How does Darktrace’s solution contrast to other AI approaches? What makes Darktrace different from its competitors?\n\nToby: There are two key differentiators to highlight when answering this question. The first comes back to the idea that we often throw around the word artificial intelligence (AI), but there isn’t just one way of doing it. When we look across organizations implementing AI into their technologies, it’s often an add-on – it’s not something at the core of what they do. But Darktrace has had AI at its core since its founding in 2013.\n\nThere is a difference between supervised and unsupervised and between self-learning and pre-trained AI models. If you’re looking at a pre-trained AI model, you entirely rely on the training data and the information fed into the models before deploying it into a customer environment. Is that truly reflective of all the cyber threats that exist? Is it fully encompassing ransomware, cybercrime, nation-states’ sophisticated hackers, or the anonymous group targeting Russia currently? What happens if the attacker changes their tradecraft so radically that previous models no longer match the activity we’d expect to see?\n\nFrom Darktrace’s perspective, we recognize that attackers are incredibly diverse, broad, and too many to count. To try and build up a set of models based on attackers is an impossible task to perfect. Instead, that’s why we focus on the defenders. That’s the big difference between self-learning AI that learns the customer environment to differentiate between normal and anomalous behaviors. Pre-trained AI cannot evolve and detect unknown or never-before-seen threats.\n\nThe other aspect that makes us unique is our ability to not just detect and alert on activity but also to respond. We can apply cybersecurity context and take direct, targeted action with Darktrace’s Antigena autonomous response technology when we see suspicious or unusual activity. We can respond autonomously; this is important because we know that ransomware actors are more likely to attack when an organization’s defenses are at their weakest – such as when security teams sleep at 3 am on a Sunday. From a defender’s perspective, this means security teams don’t have to triage every alert and run a 24/7 security operations center. Antigena is already operating in the background, containing the attack as it’s happening, giving human teams time to wake up, respond, and understand what’s going on before a full eviction. Again, that approach is unique across the cybersecurity industry.\n\nQ6: What is Darktrace Cyber AI Research Center? What are some of the most innovative research and patents to come out of Darktrace’s research?\n\nToby: A year ago, I joined an organization that now boasts around 60 patents. It’s an organization where R&D is at the core of what it’s doing. We have invested heavily in how we do research and development. We have a group of researchers predominately based in Cambridge that is genuinely at the center of AI research for its use in cybersecurity.\n\nUntil now, this research just went to the core of our product to make our products better, but we are the only ones that really benefit from it and our customers indirectly.\n\nThe idea we’re starting to think about is how we can share and publish this information. That’s ultimately how the research center originated. We are taking the current R&D work that we’re already doing to support our products and customers and asking: how can we share some of this with the broader community? How can we give a little bit of an insight into the work we’re doing?\n\nA part of that is about answering the questions of AI critics. AI critics will say AI is just a magic box doing stuff they don’t understand. But exposing our Research Center lets us show you how it works. Let us show you the research that underpins what we are doing. And again, that research has been ongoing since our founding in 2013. As we move forward into 2022 and beyond, we have been looking more and more into how we can use AI in different parts of these cybersecurity operations domains.\n\nIt is not just about detection or the response that I have already alluded to; it is also starting to look at that Prevent model. What can we do to warn our customers about where the weak points are in their environments? How can we reassure our customers that we have complete visibility of their environment? Is there an area here that is a specific concern well before an attack occurs? Can we get our customers to start shoring up their defenses based on how we are using AI to identify weak points, hotspots, and bottlenecks in their environment?\n\nQ7: What are some of the use cases of Darktrace’s self-learning AI solution? Tell us about Darktrace’s latest partnerships in the tech industry.\n\nToby: When Darktrace first started doing this work, it was geared toward the network level – packets, bits, and bytes flying around the network – and being able to profile that sort of activity and understand normal. As time has gone on, we have found more diverse ways of interacting and bringing in data from our customers. That data doesn’t just exist at a network layer; it exists in the cloud, SaaS, endpoints, and more.\n\nSome of the big pushes we have done in the last few years (and partly accelerated as our customers reacted to Covid) have been focused on how we integrate with other products. How do we bring their data to us? How do we bring their data to our AI so that we are better than the sum of individual parts?\n\nI have worked with customers whose technology stacks are incredibly diverse, with many competing vendors. But, generally speaking, they operate in isolated silos. You have one product that might tell you one thing, then you copy and paste the results from there and put it in another tool. Then you allow it to churn, and you copy and paste it again. You’re bouncing from one tool to the next. From my perspective, some of the great things to see when I talk to our customers and our development teams is that we have successfully integrated with other major tech vendors. Ultimately, we want customers not to treat security as a siloed model.\n\nOne of the biggest partnerships we launched last year was with Microsoft. It’s been great to get a good, rich understanding of how Microsoft developed its telemetry, such as its security audit logs with Microsoft 365 and Defender. Now, we can bring all those data points into Darktrace, apply our AI on top, and provide an additional layer of assurance for customers using a Microsoft-first technology stack. It is a powerful way of augmenting an existing security stack.\n\nQ8: What do you foresee as the biggest trends in cybersecurity in 2022?\n\nToby: If you had asked me this three weeks ago, several things came to mind. The first was ransomware. I think ransomware has probably been one of the most significant topics in the last two years. There is this idea of attackers targeting a network for purely financial gain, locking out a network, stealing data, and encrypting it.\n\nOne of those predictions is that companies choose to pay a ransom not necessarily because their files are encrypted but because businesses can’t continue normal operations. For all the hassle that an attacker must go through to encrypt files, maybe they don’t actually need to encrypt the files to have the same impact on a business.\n\nWe start to see ransomware spread to other parts of the network estate and authentication services – so things like Active Directory servers, for example – such that attackers are not actually encrypting the data, but they are stopping your network from running. When people can’t run their companies, they are losing millions of dollars a day—suddenly, paying a ransom of $10 million as a one-off way to get your Active Directory controller back online doesn’t seem as bad.\n\nAnother trend we have been following is the risk of the rise of the insider threat — this idea of the Great Resignation. People are now free to make life changes they previously held back on due to COVID lockdowns. Do they opt for a career change or move to a new job? Is this the opportunity to stay working from home as their de facto way of working? Or is their company mandating a return to the office?\n\nWe are seeing this almighty churn start with staff moving from organization to organization. Not only are they potentially a risk to their employer by walking out with sensitive data in their possession, but what does the process look like when they actually leave? How is that company locking down that environment access so that somebody can come in after that employee has left and keep that account active, logging on, and getting access to the network?\n\nFinally, we have the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Many assumed this would be the first major military conflict where cyber was a critical factor in deciding elements of the battlespace. Now, arguably, we have not seen that evolve as we thought. But does that still change the cybersecurity landscape? Has the invasion of Ukraine brought more Western entities together and criminal entities together to fight a common foe? Will we see a truce on the horizon? I don’t know. But certainly, it means there is a lot more uncertainty due to the global disruption.',

#   'text': 'Darktrace, a global leader in cyber security AI, announced that two National Health Service (NHS) trusts in the UK have signed million-dollar renewal contracts with Darktrace as threat levels continue to rise in the sector.\n\nThe two trusts, which between them cover five hospitals in the UK and provide emergency treatment and medical care for millions of patients every year, have chosen to continue using Darktrace’s Self-Learning AI in the face of a growing number of sophisticated cyber-attacks targeting healthcare organizations. Both trusts use Darktrace’s Enterprise Immune System and Darktrace Antigena to spot and stop unpredictable and in-progress cyber-threats before they can disrupt the delivery of critical services or lead to potentially severe consequences for hospital patients.\n\nRecommended AI News: TiDB Cloud Launches in AWS Marketplace\n\nThe healthcare sector has been increasingly targeted by adversaries both in the UK and globally in recent years as attackers have sought to gain access to sensitive patient data and to maximise disruption to the critical infrastructure on which so many people depend. The current geopolitical climate has led government bodies, such as NHS England in the UK, to caution hospitals and healthcare organizations to strengthen their defenses as threat levels have become even more acute.\n\n“We are proud to be protecting organizations like the NHS which form the backbone of our society by keeping people safe and providing critical care to patients,” said Poppy Gustafsson OBE, CEO at Darktrace. “It is more important than ever that our critical national infrastructure has robust defenses in place, and Darktrace remains focused on ensuring our customers are equipped to fight back against malicious actors as the threat landscape evolves.”\n\nRecommended AI News: Brivo Delivers Enterprise Security Solutions to Global Customers Including Afterpay and Angi\n\n[To share your insights with us, please write to sghosh@martechseries.com]',

#  {'title': 'Cicada Hacking Group Uses VLC for Launching Cyberattacks',
#   'text': 'A group of researchers has found that the popular VLC Media Player was used by Chinese hackers to launch cyberattacks. Cicada, a hacker gang that operates through several different identities, including menuPass, Stone Panda, APT10, Potassium, and Red Apollo, has been linked to these actions. Cicada has been present since 2006.\n\nThe virus that was transmitted to the victims allows hackers to access a wide range of data. It can provide access to all aspects of the system, search through running processes, and download files on command, all of which increase the potential for abuse. Such covert operations are not unusual, but this one appears to have been large-scale.\n\nCicada Hacking Group Uses VLC for Launching Cyberattacks\n\nThis espionage campaign, which involves the popular VLC Media Player, appears to have begun. The targets include a wide spectrum of entities involved in legal, governmental, or religious activity, according to a report by Bleeping Computer. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also been singled out for attack. Perhaps much more astonishing is the fact that these attacks have been extended to at least three continents.\n\nThe United States, Hong Kong, India, Italy, and Canada are among the countries that have been targeted. Only one of the victims was from Japan, which was a bit surprising. After gaining access to the victim’s computer, the attackers were able to keep it running for up to nine months.\n\nVLC was used to spread malware, but the file itself was clean. It appears that a secure version of VLC was coupled with a malicious DLL file in the same location as the media player’s export functions. This is known as DLL side-loading, and Cicada isn’t the only one who uses it to inject malware into otherwise secure apps.\n\nCicada’s unique loader was reportedly utilized in prior attacks linked to the hacker group. A Microsoft Exchange server was used to get access to the networks that were compromised first. In addition, a WinVNC server was installed to allow remote control of the systems infected with the concealed virus.\n\nFurthermore, an exploit known as Sodamaster was employed, which runs silently in system memory without the need for any files. It has the ability to avoid detection and postpone execution upon startup.\n\nAlthough these attacks are unquestionably dangerous, not every VLC user needs to be concerned. The media player was found to be virus-free, and the hackers appear to have taken a very targeted strategy, focusing on certain organizations. When it comes to PCs, however, it’s always crucial to stay on top of security.\n\nCheck out? National Cyber Security Policy Emphasizes on Digital Transformation & Mitigation of Cyber Attacks',

#  {'title': '10 analogies from AI x GOV',
#   'text': 'We’ve just wrapped up our virtual flagship summit, AI x GOV! Speakers from all over Asia Pacific and the world discussed topics ranging from AI-driven citizen services and edutech to healthcare and cyber diplomacy.\n\nHere are 10 big ideas on the future of public service innovation condensed into neat analogies.\n\n1. Regional cyber cooperation is about guarding your neighbourhood\n\n“If you see your neighbour’s house burning, do not point and laugh because yours will be next.” Gaurav Keerthi, Deputy Chief Executive (Development) at Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency shared at the Cyber diplomacy for a safer future panel.\n\nThis isn’t just a matter of goodwill. Countries have to help each other “because that fire spreads downwards”, he added.\n\nASEAN understands this, and member countries work together to share information every time an attack happens. “We immediately pick up the phone and say, ‘Are you seeing this too? This is what I have, what do you have?’,” he said.\n\nThe region’s approach to cyber cooperation could be a model for others. Countries have made individual commitments to the UN’s 11 cyber norms for responsible state behaviour. But ASEAN is the only group to have done so at a regional level, said Johanna Weaver, Director, Tech Policy Design Centre, Australian National University, at the same panel.\n\n2. Defending healthcare systems is like protecting a child\n\n“It takes a community to care for a child. It also takes a community to protect that child,” said Leon Chang, Assistant Chief Executive of Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS), Singapore, at the panel on Protecting healthcare beyond its four walls.\n\nIt takes everyone in healthcare to protect healthcare, he added. This means that every staff interacting with the healthcare system from IT teams to clinicians, and even third party vendors, has a part to play.\n\nFor example, every staff member needs to be alert against phishing attempts; and everyone has a different role during simulation exercises of cyber attacks.\n\n3. Cyber regulation is not a question of the pathway, but the destination\n\nWhen sensitive data was kept on paper, governments didn’t mandate that it can only be kept in five storey buildings. In the digital age, it remains the case that regulating “the pathway” to cybersecurity is ineffective, HE Kersti Kaljulaid, President of Estonia 2016-2021, pointed out in her keynote address.\n\nThis was an analogy she used to explain that governments should focus their attention on securing data. As long as organisations can demonstrate that their data is protected, cyber regulation does not have to prescribe how every organisation should secure itself, she said.\n\n4. A classroom of students is a classroom of unique paths\n\n“A classroom of 20 is a classroom of 20 different paths,” shared Anna Korpi, Counsellor, Education and Science, Embassy of Finland in Singapore at the A classroom of one: Personalising the student experience with AI panel. Finland adopted a “deep personalisation” strategy to support the uniqueness of every student, she highlighted.\n\nNew tech tools are supporting Finland’s teachers in this, especially with time being a “scarce resource” during the pandemic, Korpi said. One tool helps to collect data on student wellbeing, rather than teachers having to gather that information manually.\n\nThis gives teachers more time to interact with and supports students facing challenges, she explained. It could even be used to detect issues such as bullying.\n\n5. Moving to the cloud is like moving house and getting to upgrade appliances\n\nJust as shifting houses is the best time to upgrade appliances, moving to the cloud gives organisations the opportunity to replace unwieldy processes and outdated systems, said Lim May-Ann, Director of the Fairtech Institute and Emeritus Director at the Asia Cloud Computing Association.\n\n“When you rearchitect your government services, you start to upgrade,” she explained at The great migration: Securing the move to cloud panel. If the fridge is getting a little old, you get to buy a new one. If a database is slowing an organisation down, it can explore alternative options.\n\nThe chance to review current processes and rethink what works best could birth more innovations, she said.\n\n“Let’s buy a new fridge, let’s do something new.”\n\n6. AI may become another tool in the toolbox for future public officials\n\nAI algorithms currently take multiple teams and a bunch of different technologies to put together. But Yong Lu, Vice President, Shanghai Data Exchange, envisions a future in which AI will become a simple drag and drop tool for public servants.\n\n“AI can just be like a tool in the toolbox,” he said at the Future of AI in government panel. Officials would be able to assign a task to AI and leave it to work.\n\nThere isn’t yet enough historical data to train algorithms to do this, he explained. But as time passes and the tech matures, AI will only get easier to build and use.\n\n7. When it comes to managing data across government services, think of data as a pipeline rather than a pile\n\nData is not “a pile of stuff” waiting to be cleaned up, shared Li Hongyi, Director, Open Government Products, Singapore at the AI for inclusion panel. To manage good data, it may be useful to imagine a “pipeline”, journeying from creation all the way to collection.\n\nFor governments to implement AI-driven projects well, it starts with ensuring that all processes are digitised, rather than depending on manual processes. This may look like having data stored on central databases, rather than Excel sheets stored on “Simon’s laptop on the other side of the office.”\n\nThis makes it easier to maintain base standards across the entire data journey from the get-go. Dates can be standardised across all government services as DD/MM/YY rather than MM/DD/YYYY, for instance.\n\nWhen it comes to providing good data, it has less to do with fancy data models and more to do with ensuring systems are digitised and representing data in standard ways, he shared.\n\n8. Creating AI-driven citizen services is like building a mall\n\nGovernments wouldn’t expect a citizen to know how to build a shopping mall or the details of how one may affect traffic flows, noted Rushi Ramachandrappa, Project Lead for G20 Global Smart Cities Alliance, World Economic Forum at the Smart city convenience: simplifying citizen experiences with AI panel.\n\nNevertheless, they may still include citizens in defining the vision for what role a shopping mall may play in the community, he said. At the local level, it is common to include citizens as part of the ideation stage for such public projects, he explained.\n\nSimilarly, citizens can still work with technologists to co-create AI-driven citizen services that serve the community well even if they don’t understand the nitty-gritty of building such services, he highlighted.\n\n9. In education, data doesn’t mean magic\n\nWhen Ibrahim Bashir finished his master’s degree in Computer Science, he looked to create his own educational technology startup with AI. “With all the hubris of a tech guy”, he thought that getting his hands on data would instantly lead to magic in the classroom, he shared at the A classroom of one: Personalising the student experience with AI panel.\n\nBut he discovered that isn’t enough. In his work as Technical Project Manager in Educate Ventures Research, he realised that tools which prioritise students and teachers, rather than the technology, will make the most impact.\n\nAI is “a transformational” technology, but that results in organisations trying to “brute force it” onto different problems, he explained. The best tools for education are ones that focus on students and truly examine the best ways for them to learn, Bashir said.\n\nThis is the study of a student’s “metacognition”, which refers to how students learn how to learn, he shares. Personalisation without understanding how each student learns is simply profiling, Bashir continued.\n\n10. Not controlling access is like selling air tickets without allocated seats\n\nWhen employees have too much access to the organisation’s network, it’s like getting a ticket to an airplane without a seat allocation. Passengers can sit “wherever they want” once they enter, illustrated Scott Hesford, Director, Solutions Engineering, Asia Pacific at BeyondTrust.\n\nIn contrast, having a least privileged access management model ensures that employees can only access precisely what they require, he said at the panel on Securing the digital ID. This is similar to a ticket that has a clear seat number for each passenger, he explained.\n\nThis helps government employees build trust in citizen services and ensure that data remains protected from ransomware attacks and other data breaches, he noted.',

#  {'title': 'FIN7 crime-gang pen tester headed to prison for five years',
#   'text': 'Another member of notorious cybercrime ring FIN7 is headed to jail after the gang breached major companies\' networks across the US and stole more than $1 billion from these businesses\' customers.\n\nUkrainian-born Denys Iarmak, 32, who worked as a penetration tester for the criminal group, was sentenced to five years in prison for his affiliation with FIN7.\n\nAt his sentencing hearing, the judge noted that Iarmak, who was arrested in 2019, has been in US custody during the Covid-19 pandemic and now the war in Ukraine.\n\n"There is some irony, that the nation you were plundering is now leading an international effort to protect your country, your people, your family," said Chief US District Judge Ricardo Martinez.\n\nSince at least 2015, FIN7 gang members have used phishing emails with malicious files attached to break into hundreds of companies\' networks. Once they gained access, they injected malware to steal customers\' credit- and debit-card numbers, which they then sold on the dark web or used to fund their own shopping sprees.\n\nIn the US alone, FIN7 stole more than 20 million customer card records from over 6,500 point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate businesses, according to the feds. The miscreants have a preference for the restaurant, gambling and hospitality industries, and they breached chain restaurants including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chili\'s, Arby\'s and Red Robin.\n\nCrime pays…for a while\n\nIarmak\'s involvement with the notorious crime group started around November 2016 and lasted about two years, according to the Justice Department. He allegedly used project management software such as JIRA, hosted on servers in other countries, to coordinate FIN7\'s illegal deeds and manage its network intrusions.\n\nThis proved to be a lucrative gig for Iarmak. "During the course of the scheme, Iarmak received compensation for his participation in FIN7, which far exceeded comparable legitimate employment in Ukraine," the Justice Department noted.\n\nAfter being arrested in Bangkok in late 2019, Iarmak was eventually extradited by a Thai court and transferred to US custody in May 2020.\n\nIn November 2021, Iarmak pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking.\n\nIarmak is the third FIN7 criminal to face time behind bars for his misdeeds. On April 16, 2021, FIN7 member Fedir Hladyr was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Two months later, FIN7 member Andrii Kolpakov was sentenced to seven years.\n\nWhile breaking into companies\' payments systems has proven very lucrative for FIN7 over the years, new research published by threat intel firm Mandiant suggests that the crime gang has moved into ransomware to monetize its attacks.\n\n"Throughout their evolution, FIN7 has increased the speed of their operational tempo, the scope of their targeting, and even possibly their relationships with other ransomware operations in the cybercriminal underground," Mandiant threat researchers wrote. ®',

#   'text': 'In CSI\'s seventh annual Banking Priorities survey, bankers selected cybersecurity as the issue most likely to affect the financial industry in 2022, with employee-targeted phishing named as the top cybersecurity threat. CSI\'s survey also found that 39% of bankers listed data privacy as their primary regulatory concern, which is well-founded, as the recent computer-security incident rule for reporting cyber incidents compounds their responsibility to protect data.\n\nAs cybercriminals deploy harder-to-detect methodologies, financial institutions must remain vigilant against attacks designed to infiltrate their networks, data and systems. Early awareness and detection help financial institutions more effectively combat threats by allowing them to react before the threats become widespread. To enhance awareness and reporting, federal bank regulatory agencies approved a final rule to improve the sharing of information about computer-security incidents.\n\nDownload the 2022 Banking Priorities Executive Report to gain insight into bankers\' perspectives on top regulatory issues, strategies to combat cyber threats and more.\n\nWhat is the Final Rule for Computer-Security Incident Reporting?\n\nIn November 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation finalized a rule requiring banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator of any qualifying "computer-security incident " as soon as possible but no later than 36 hours after occurrence. The rule also requires bank service providers to notify affected customers as quickly as possible if the provider experiences a computer-security incident that has affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, customers for four or more hours by disrupting services.\n\nThis notification is required for any incident that substantially affects, or is reasonably likely to affect, the viability of a banking organization\'s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services or the financial sector\'s stability. This rule became effective April 1, 2022, and applicable organizations must be compliant beginning May 1, 2022.\n\nWhat is a Computer-Security Incident?\n\nThe final rule defines a computer-security incident as "an occurrence that results in actual harm to an information system or the information contained within it." Computer-security incidents can result from malware, malicious software or cyberattacks. Often these originate from social engineering, as well as non-malicious failure of hardware and software or human error.\n\nThis final rule is triggered, and an institution must alert its regulator within 36 hours, when a computer-security incident becomes a notification incident. The rule states that a notification incident is a computer-security incident that has materially disrupted, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt, a banking organization\'s banking operations, business lines or associated services or functions.\n\nExamples of a computer-security incident that could become a notification incident include, but are not limited to:\n\nCyber-related interruptions, such as ransomware attacks or large-scale distributed denial of service attacks\n\nComputer hacking incidents that disable banking operations for an extended period\n\nMajor computer system failures, such as a failed system upgrade that results in outages for customers\n\nOther types of significant operational interruptions\n\nComplying with the Computer-Security Incident Rule\n\nYour institution should have an incident response plan (IRP) that includes action steps and a communication strategy to guide you in the event of a cybersecurity incident. With the new 36-hour requirement for notifications, your institution should revisit your IRP and incorporate processes to meet this computer-security incident rule. Here are four questions to consider as you update your IRP:\n\nHow does your institution review security incidents?\n\nWhat qualifies as an incident? Does this align with the definition of a computer-security incident within the final rule?\n\nIf an incident occurs, how quickly will you send notifications?\n\nWhat is your process for sending notifications?\n\nEnhance Your Institution\'s Incident Response Plan\n\nSpend the time upfront to ensure you address this new notification requirement by refining your IRP. As cyber threats evolve and cybercriminals become more aggressive, the question is not whether your institution will experience an attack, but when. Maintaining an effective IRP and testing it regularly will put your institution in a stronger position to weather a cyberattack and its aftermath.\n\nDownload your copy of the 2022 Banking Priorities Executive Report for additional insight into meeting regulatory requirements, fending off cybersecurity threats and more.\n\nGET YOUR COPY\n\nSteve Sanders serves as CSI\'s chief information security officer.

#  {'title': 'Opinion: 8 Commonly Misunderstood or Overused Words in IT',
#   'text': 'In technology, there are a host of words which are both overused and misunderstood. As technology evolves, so does our vocabulary. When we use shortcuts or slang for commonly used words, their true meaning can become unclear. As William Souder wrote in 2014 for MinnPost , “I am constantly reminded that our shared understanding of ‘ordinary’ words isn’t what it used to be. Everyday language is increasingly an approximation of proper English. People misuse words ever more frequently, confusing assumed meanings with original meanings, and picking up habits of speech only because certain mistakes have become so common that everyone now understands them to mean what they did not mean in the first place.”In both higher education and corporate sectors, many shortcuts and buzzwords are used to get to the point quicker or to demonstrate familiarity with current trends. Tom Musbach wrote for Fast Company last week, “There’s nothing inherently wrong with having a set of terms, a common lexicon, by which people in a given field or industry can easily communicate. This is what business buzzwords are — a set of terms that are readily understood in the corporate environment. When used properly and in context, these buzzwords serve as a sort of linguistic shorthand. When overused or misused, however, buzzwords can overshadow or even distort the overall communication. Using too many buzzwords can lessen an individual’s credibility as an independent, intelligent, creative thinker.”In technology we utilize a complex web of acronyms, abbreviations and technical jargon. Some of these words seep into our daily vocabulary across disciplines and in our daily life. This process can evolve over time or occur in a split second, thanks to Twitter or TikTok. The following list may provide guidance on better word accuracy, and hopefully avoid those “rolled eyes” at meetings or listening to a potential hire displaying their technical acumen./haekt/People tend to jump to conclusions when they think they’ve been hacked, particularly with Facebook. If someone is already your Facebook friend, you cannot send them another friend request. What more likely happened is that your account was cloned. This occurs when someone creates a new Facebook account, using your name but not your email address, along with photos of you on their account, or they search your public posts to find out who your Facebook friends are and then send new friend requests from the new fake account. Most of the time Facebook accounts aren’t hacked but cloned.When people receive friend requests which have already been accepted, they contact their friends and announce, “I’ve been hacked!” Certainly, your accounthacked if someone gets a hold of your password. As a precaution, change your password often, turn on two-factor authentication, check any unrecognized logins, and report the incident to Facebook. Rather than sending out “I’ve been hacked” warning messages, just tell people to disregard the new friend requests.This increased phobia of “being hacked” can be traced to the dramatic increase of cyber attacks. This is illustrated in a Google Ngram below, an “online word search engine which charts the frequencies of any set of search strings using a yearly count of n-grams found in sources printed between 1500 and 2019.”/ˈbandˌwidTH/This word can cause eye-rolling when someone drops into your office to ask if you have the bandwidth to do a job. Bandwidth is defined as “the maximum amount of data (or volume) transmitted over a path or connection in a given amount of time.” Today the term is used to infer how much time you have available. As the Google Ngram shows, bandwidth seems to coincide with the explosion of the Internet. It may be more accurate to just ask someone if they have time available./disˈrəpSH(ə)n/Disruption can be described as a disturbance which interrupts an event, activity or process. This could be a profound change to an existing market sector of a process due to innovative technologies. Sometimes the words "disruption" and "digital transformation" in higher education are used interchangeably, which is not accurate.Matt Shearer in IT ProPortal wrote last year, “Disruption has been occurring since people first started trading goods and services. You could also use that term to describe the evolution of strategic innovation since the dawn of time. It’s a more philosophical definition ... Digital transformation, on the other hand, is the process of using technology to become, and remain, agile. Agility enables businesses to adapt to different markets and market conditions, so they can weather external disruption.”While disruption and digital transformation are connected, Shearer emphasized, “digital transformation becomes a part of the disruption story only when it is done well.” We should use a more positive term like innovation instead./vuhl-ner-uh-bil-i-tee/A vulnerability, usually tied to cybersecurity, is when your computer network potentially allows unauthorized access to systems and data. This word comes up frequently during cybersecurity audits. A vulnerabilityyour system has been compromised, but there is a potential your network could be infiltrated if appropriate cyber protection tools are not in place. Sometimes the words vulnerability and incident are used interchangeably./ˈinsəd(ə)nt/An incident in cybersecurity means someone or something has successfully navigated a vulnerability in a network or system. This also comes up in cybersecurity audits or when a system has been compromised, hacked or infiltrated, and if malware or ransomware has been deployed. Carefully using the correct description during an audit or a cyber attack is crucial./ˈklīənt/Client software is a specific application installed on your computer. For non-IT end users, it would be easier to understand to say this is the software application loaded onto your desktop or laptop computer./ˈtāk ˈt͟his ˈȯf-ˈlīn/This is a common phrase when people want to take or move the conversation to another separate meeting, either because the topic has gone “off-track,” to avoid conflict, or because a deeper discussion is needed. It may be more accurate to say, "we need to have a separate meeting on the topic."/ˈlō-ˈhaŋ-iŋ ˈfrüt/Low-hanging fruit refers to the lower fruit on the tree which is easier to grab. In meetings, the phrase has become a metaphor describing tasks which can be easily and quickly accomplished. Some may classify the saying as being overused or annoying. Spencer Bowen, program director of the nonprofit accelerator AgStart summed it up in Comstock\'s Magazine : “Don’t just use platitudes. If you are going to deploy this overused kitschy term, make sure you’re actually attaching it to something you’re going to do for a person.”Next year there likely will be another overused words list as we continue to blend technology into our daily work and lives. Let us hope for clarity, accuracy and brevity in our word choices, so we can better understand and communicate effectively. As Thomas Jefferson reminds us, "The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do." Let’s make sure it’s the correct word and definition.',

#  {'title': 'Departments to undergo independent audits of cyber resilience',
#   'text': 'Credit: Debora Cartagena, USCDCP on Pixnio\n\nWhitehall departments will be required to go through an external audit of their cyber resilience to help ministers “understand cyber risk across government”.\n\nCalled ‘Gov Assure’, the regime will ask all government entities to undergo independent assessment of their cyber set-up and risk profile. This process will be based on the guidelines set out in the Cyber Assessment Framework of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).\n\nThe measures were first unveiled as part of the Government Cyber Security Strategy, published earlier this year.\n\nCabinet Office minister and paymaster general Michael Ellis said: “This will create a single lens through which we can understand cyber risk across government and enable government departments to accurately assess their level of cyber assurance and highlight priority areas for improvement. Gov Assure will also help us to take a strategic view of government vulnerability – to help inform a strategic roadmap to truly defend as one.”\n\nEllis’s comments were made during PublicTechnology’s annual Cyber Security Summit event, held in London last week. Delivering the opening keynote presentation, the minister gave attendees an insight into the intent behind public sector cyber plan, and the plans for its implementation over the coming months and years.\n\nThe 84-page policy document sets out an ambition for the public sector’s “critical functions to be significantly hardened to cyberattack by 2025”.\n\nBy the end of this decade, the plan is for all public bodies to be “resilient to known vulnerabilities and attack methods”.\n\n2030\n\nDate by which public sector bodies should be resilient to all current known vulnerabilities\n\n\n\n£2.6bn\n\nAmount of money committed in the recent spending review to improve cyber resilience and address legacy IT across government\n\n\n\n777\n\nNumber of incidents requiring a response from the NCSC in the year to the end of August 2021\n\n\n\n40%\n\nProportion of these incidents that were targeted at a public-sector entity\n\n“To keep everyone safe online… the public sector must lead by example,” Ellis said. “If we are to continue to prevent public services coming under pressure, and protect them from the harmful consequences when they do, we need to act. Our core public sector functions – from the delivery of public services to the operation of national security apparatus – must be more resilient than ever before to cyberattack.”\n\nOne of the key strands of the strategy will be to develop and put in place a public sector-wide framework to ensure services, products and platforms are designed with security in mind. This will “ensure that appropriate and proportionate cybersecurity measures are embedded within the technology that we all use”, the minister said.\n\n“This world-leading framework will allow all of us to take advantage of industry innovation by enhancing our ability to test, to pilot and to deploy commercial tools, services and capabilities,” he added. “This will be supported by robust measures to mitigate risk, including domestic regulation and international collaboration on standards.”\n\nRapid response\n\nCybersecurity becomes even more important in given government’s intention to “embrace the development of connected place technology” – such as sensors and digitally enabled public infrastructure.\n\n“When properly secured, smart-city approaches have the opportunity to transform the interaction between government and citizen,” Ellis said. “Connected places provide tangible benefits to society, managing traffic, reducing pollution – and saving money and resources. We should take this opportunity to better serve our communities. But we must do this in a way that is mindful of risk – the interconnectivity that allows places to function more efficiently also creates cyber vulnerabilities, and the potential for cyberattacks.”\n\nGovernment intends to boost the NCSC’s existing Connected Places Cyber Security Principles guidelines. It will also “strengthen the capability of local authorities and organisations such as ports, universities and hospitals to buy and use connected places technology securely”, Ellis told conference attendees.\n\nUnderpinning the rollout of the strategy will be a new Government Cyber Coordination Centre. The entity is a joint venture between the Government Security Group, the Central Digital and Data Office and the NCSC.\n\nThe minister claimed that the centre will “transform how we use cybersecurity data – by facilitating threat and vulnerability management at scale, and fostering partnerships across the public sector” and the country at large.\n\n“If we are to continue to prevent public services coming under pressure, and protect them from the harmful consequences when they do, we need to act.”\n\nCabinet Office minister Michael Ellis\n\nt will also lead government’s response to successful attacks.\n\n“I am proud to say that when UK public services have suffered attacks, the government has acted fast to support getting key services back up and running, and also to manage any risks to stolen data,” Ellis said. “However, we should – inevitably – expect challenges.”\n\nHe added: “Where we cannot prevent them, we will rapidly identify, investigate and coordinate our response to cyberthreats, where criminals find weaknesses in our defences, we will learn and build them back stronger.”\n\nTo help combat the current threat from Russia, the NCSC is being supported by a newly created Government Information Cell, which has brought together about 35 staff from the Home Office, Cabinet Office, Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The remit of the cell is to counteract the Kremlin’s narratives about the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“The NCSC has been liaising regularly with major social-media platforms to monitor and share information,” Ellis said. “Their work also aids our Government Information Cell, bringing together counter-disinformation expertise to identify and tackle Russian information aggression targeted at the UK.”',

#  {'title': 'IronNet Stock Q4 Clues: Avoid This Cybersecurity Stock (NYSE:IRNT)',
#   'text': "greenbutterfly/iStock via Getty Images\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nIronNet (NYSE:IRNT) is a next-generation cybersecurity company. IronNet's Collective Defense platform has a compelling offering, in that the more users on its platform, the more powerful and faster its ability to detect potential attacks.\n\nSince the breakout of the war in Ukraine, many investors rushed towards cybersecurity names, as there was the expectation that the sector would see strong demand. That was the thinking.\n\nBut this is a case of ugly facts getting in the way of a beautiful story.\n\nIn fact, Q4 2022 results reported yesterday, exemplifies that even after many cybersecurity stocks are down more than 50% to 70% in the past six months, that doesn't necessarily mean they offer investors value.\n\nParticularly in the case of IronNet, I make the argument that IronNet is going to have to raise funds imminently and dilute shareholders. This business is a cash incinerator that carries less than $50 million of cash on its balance sheet.\n\nFour months ago I wrote the article, IronNet: Avoid this name, where I said ''I investors should not look to buy the dip here.''\n\nIronNet author's coverage\n\nSince that time, including yesterday's sell-off, the stock is down more than 30%. And it will continue to fall further. Here's why you should still avoid this cybersecurity company.\n\nRevenue Growth Rates, Before and After Reality\n\nIronNet investor presentation\n\nThis is IronNet's investor presentation from August 2021. You can observe that for fiscal 2022, management had previously guided to reach $43 million for the year. What did the year ultimately end up at?\n\nIronNet's fiscal 2022 ended up at $28 million, down 6% y/y. This is supposed to be a high-growth business! How does it end up down?\n\nNext, looking further ahead, the guide pointed to fiscal 2023 growing by 58% y/y. And now, as we get closer to reality, what's the actual guide? To grow by 25% y/y.\n\nEven if we allow for some lowballing, surely you agree, this business is far from growing as it expected last summer?\n\nWhy IronNet?\n\nIronNet is a cybersecurity leader that through its Collective Defense platform allows customers to secure their networks at scale.\n\nIronNet investor presentation\n\nIts Collective Defense platform that you can see above goes beyond threat detection. IronNet deploys Network Detection and Response solutions through behavioral analytics to leverage anonymized automated correlated alerts across different companies on its platform.\n\nThink of it this way, rather than having independent threat detections, once alerts get reported on the network, by external users, IronNet's Collective Defense platform is able to be on alert from that trigger.\n\nIn other words, the more customers on IronNet's platform, the stronger IronNet's value proposition becomes. Clearly, this offers users tremendous value, as customers protect the capabilities and effectiveness of their own network security, as they operate anonymously to provide other users on the network with incident response detection.\n\nIRNT Valuation - Still Overvalued, Even Now\n\nThe thesis for IronNet's bull case in the past several weeks had turned its focus toward the theme of ''cyber becoming an element of national power''. The idea here is simple, with the war in Europe, companies should ready themselves for more cyber warfare.\n\nHowever, think about this, if we add back $157 million of stock-based compensation, which is now practically worthless, IronNet burnt through $87 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2022.\n\nGiven that the business carries less than $48 million of cash, they are going to have to raise capital quickly. And it will be on onerous terms. There's no getting around this.\n\nWith all this in mind, there's simply no way this business is worth 9x forward sales. This is still overvalued, even now.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFor bullish investors in the name, I know the thesis well, ''I'll just wait until I break even''. And do you know why I know that?\n\nBecause I've been that investor in the past. Not with IronNet, but with other stocks. And it's taken me a seriously long time to up my game.\n\nBut now I believe that I'm better able to recognize what's an opportunity and what's a colorful story. Having called this correctly 4 months ago, I'm inclined to believe that I'm going to call this right again over the next 6 months. Whatever you decide, good luck and happy investing.",

#  {'title': 'Adobe Creative Cloud Experience makes malware easier to run',
#   'text': 'Adobe Creative Cloud Experience, a service installed via the Creative Cloud installer for Windows, includes a Node.js executable that can be abused to infect and compromise a victim\'s PC.\n\nMichael Taggart, a security researcher, recently demonstrated that the node.exe instance accompanying Adobe\'s service could be exploited by writing a simple proof-of-concept JavaScript file that spawns the Windows Calculator app.\n\n"I have confirmed that the node.exe packaged with the Adobe Customer Experience service can run any JavaScript you point it to," he explained to The Register.\n\n"So the attack chain may look like an installer or zip file that drops [a JavaScript file], or even a macro that drops JavaScript in a user-writable directory, then invokes Adobe\'s own node.exe for execution."\n\nSecurity researchers commenting on Taggart\'s finding said they\'d been under the impression the bundled Node runtime would only execute files signed by Adobe, but evidently that\'s not the case.\n\nThe presence of an unrestricted instance of Node.js on a system isn\'t as severe as a backdoor or internet-facing flaw that enables remote code execution – an attacker without some other vulnerability to exploit would need to induce the victim to download and run the script. But its availability does make it easier to mount an attack and to conceal that anyone has done so.\n\n"Because the JavaScript is getting invoked by path in C:\\Program Files , it would be extremely difficult to detect from a monitoring/threat hunting perspective," explained Taggart, who added that he was able to get his own custom file dropper to run and execute a command-and-control agent without any warning from Windows Defender.\n\nIn other words, the primary benefit of abusing node.exe in this way would be to run unsigned code in a way that isn\'t obvious to threat detection systems.\n\nCuriously, this is not the first time concerns have been raised about Creative Cloud Experience. An Adobe customer posting to the Adobe Support Community post in February notes, "My protection program on my PC detected the folder Adobe Creative Cloud Experience, e.g. node.exe , as security risk." The advice given is to simply ignore the warnings.\n\nThen there\'s a post from December, 2021, in which an Adobe customer inquires about Malwarebytes security software detecting a suspicious outbound connection from the node.exe instance within Creative Cloud Experience.\n\nThe presence of node.exe in other Adobe applications like Photoshop has also elicited concern from those presented with warnings about the executable from their security applications. A discussion spanning the past three years in the forum for Acronis, a security application, suggests warnings raised over the presence of node.exe are false positives and that users should tell their apps to ignore such files.\n\nThe Register asked Adobe whether it considers the ability to run unsigned code systems via Creative Cloud Experience\'s node.exe to be a problem, but we\'ve not heard back. ®',

Try refreshing your browser, or University of Calgary launches 'real world' cybersecurity hub Back to video The Canadian Cyber Assessment, Training and Experimentation Centre opened Thursday. Its labs are designed to simulate situations that cybersecurity experts face in the field. “What we want to do is create, to the greatest extent possible, a real-world experience of working in a security centre that you might find in certain large businesses or in government agencies or even within military applications,” said Ken Barker, director of the U of C’s Institute for Security, Privacy and Information Assurance. “The idea is getting students into this real-world experience so they actually have a sense what it’s like to work in these areas.” A common idea in cybersecurity is “ethical hacking,” Barker said, in which users attempt to identify security vulnerabilities so those weaknesses can be addressed. But since this activity can carry legal risks in the real world, the school set up a virtual environment called a “cyber range” to simulate the process.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Students can even be broken up into a virtual game of capture the flag, in which one team attempts to break into a system while the other works to thwart those attacks. Professionals with cybersecurity skills are in high demand, Barker said, as focus on the field has magnified in recent years. “The growth in this area and the challenge in this area is scary, in terms of how many attacks are actually occurring out there and in terms of the consciousness of people with digital assets in protecting them,” Barker said. “We know, for example, that we have a significant shortfall in this country and around the world of cybersecurity experts who can come in and help companies out.” Computer science students at the U of C can currently receive a concentrate in computer security, but Barker said he’d argue another degree could be offered entirely, to wrap together computer science concepts with the legal, policy and sociological aspects of cybersecurity.

article_list = [{'title': 'Chinese Hacker Groups Continue to Target Indian Power Grid Assets',
'text': 'China-linked adversaries have been attributed to an ongoing onslaught against Indian power grid organizations, one year after a concerted campaign targeting critical infrastructure in the country came to light.\nMost of the intrusions involved a modular backdoor named ShadowPad, according to Recorded Future’s Insikt Group, a sophisticated remote access trojan which has been dubbed a “masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage.“\n“ShadowPad continues to be employed by an ever-increasing number of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Ministry of State Security (MSS)-linked groups, with its origins linked to known MSS contractors first using the tool in their own operations and later likely acting as a digital quartermaster,“ the researchers said.\n\nThe goal of the sustained campaign, the cybersecurity company said, is to facilitate intelligence gathering pertaining to critical infrastructure systems in preparation for future contingency operations. The targeting is believed to have commenced in September 2021.\nThe attacks took aim at seven State Load Despatch Centres (SDLCs) located primarily in Northern India, in particular those close to the disputed India-China border in Ladakh, with one of the targets victimized in a similar attack disclosed in February 2021 and attributed to the RedEcho group.\nThe 2021 RedEcho attacks involved the compromise of 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations, including six of the country’s regional and state load despatch centres (RLDC), two ports, a nation power plant, and a substation.\n\nRecorded Future linked the latest set of malicious activities to an emerging threat cluster it’s tracking under the moniker Threat Activity Group 38 aka TAG-38 (similar to the UNC#### and DEV-#### designations given by Mandiant and Microsoft), citing “notable distinctions“ from that of the previously identified RedEcho TTPs.\nIn addition to attacking power grid assets, TAG-38 impacted a national emergency response system and the Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company.\nAlthough the initial infection vector used to breach the networks is unknown, the ShadowPad malware on the host systems were commandeered by means of a network of infected internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices geolocated in Taiwan and South Korea.\n“The use of ShadowPad across Chinese activity groups continues to grow over time, with new clusters of activity regularly identified using the backdoor as well as continued adoption by previously tracked clusters,“ the researchers said, adding it’s monitoring at least 10 distinct groups with access to the malware.\n\nFollowing the disclosure, India’s Union Power Minister R. K. Singh characterized the intrusions as unsuccessful “probing attempts“ at hacking which happened in January and February, and that the government is constantly reviewing its cybersecurity mechanisms to bolster defenses.\nChina, for its part, reiterated that it “firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks“ and that “cybersecurity is a common challenge facing all countries that should be jointly addressed through dialogue and cooperation.“\n“Recently, Chinese cybersecurity companies released a series of reports, revealing that the U.S. government launched cyber attacks on many countries around the world, including China, seriously jeopardizing the security of critical infrastructure of these countries,“ China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said.\n“It is worth noting that many of U.S. allies or countries with which it cooperates on cyber security are also victims of U.S. cyber attacks. We believe that the international community, especially China’s neighboring countries, will keep their eyes wide open and make their own judgment on the true intentions of the U.S. side.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Connect BlackCat Ransomware with Past BlackMatter Malware Activity',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered further links between BlackCat (aka AlphaV) and BlackMatter ransomware families, the former of which emerged as a replacement following international scrutiny last year.\n“At least some members of the new BlackCat group have links to the BlackMatter group, because they modified and reused a custom exfiltration tool [...] and which has only been observed in BlackMatter activity,“ Kaspersky researchers said in a new analysis.\nThe tool, dubbed Fendr, has not only been upgraded to include more file types but also used by the gang extensively to steal data from corporate networks in December 2021 and January 2022 prior to encryption, in a popular tactic called double extortion.\n\nThe findings come less than a month after Cisco Talos researchers identified overlaps in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) between BlackCat and BlackMatter, describing the new ransomware variant as a case of “vertical business expansion.“\n\nBlackCat stands out for two reasons: it’s an affiliate actor that has deployed BlackMatter in the past and its malware is written in Rust, indicating how threat actors are increasingly pivoting to programming languages with cross-compilation capabilities.\nThe group “provides infrastructure, malware samples, ransom negotiations, and probably cash-out,“ the researchers noted. “Anyone who already has access to compromised environments can use BlackCat’s samples to infect a target.“\n\nOnce executed, the malware gets the Windows system’s MachineGuid from the registry — a unique key generated during the installation of the operating system — as well as its UUID, before proceeding to bypass User Account Control (UAC), delete shadow backups, and start the encryption process.\n“This use of a modified Fendr, also known as ExMatter, represents a new data point connecting BlackCat with past BlackMatter activity,“ the researchers said.\n“The modification of this reused tool demonstrates a more sophisticated planning and development regimen for adapting requirements to target environments, characteristic of a maturing criminal enterprise.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A 32-year-old Ukrainian national has been sentenced to five years in prison in the U.S. for the individual’s criminal work as a “high-level hacker“ in the financially motivated group FIN7.\nDenys Iarmak, who worked as a penetration tester for the cartel from November 2016 through November 2018, had been previously arrested in Bangkok, Thailand in November 2019, before being extradited to the U.S. in May 2020.\nIn November 2021, Iarmak had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking.\n\nFIN7 has been attributed to a number of attacks that have led to the theft of more than 20 million customer card records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations in the U.S, costing the victims $1 billion in losses.\nThe criminal gang, also known as Carbanak Group and the Navigator Group, has a track record of hitting restaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries to siphon customer credit and debit card numbers since at least 2015 that were then used or sold for profit.\n“Mr. Iarmak was directly involved in designing phishing emails embedded with malware, intruding on victim networks, and extracting data such as payment card information,“ said U.S. Attorney Nicholas W. Brown of the Western District of Washington. “To make matters worse, he continued his work with the FIN7 criminal enterprise even after the arrests and prosecution of co-conspirators.“\nAccording to court documents released by the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ), the defendant used Atlassian’s Jira project management and issue-tracking software to coordinate and share details pertaining to different intrusions conducted by the group.\n“Under each issue, FIN7 members tracked their progress breaching a victim’s security, uploaded data stolen from the victim, and provided guidance to each other,“ the DoJ said.\n\nIarmak is the third FIN7 member of the group to be sentenced in the U.S. after Fedir Hladyr and Andrii Kolpakov, both of whom were awarded a prison term of 10 years and seven years respectively in April and June last year.\nThe development comes as threat intelligence and incident response firm Mandiant detailed the evolution of FIN7 into a resilient cyber crime group, linking it to 17 clusters of previously unattributed threat activity spanning several years, while also calling out its upgraded attack toolkit and initial access techniques and its shift to ransomware to monetize its attacks.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft on Thursday disclosed that it obtained a court order to take control of seven domains used by APT28, a state-sponsored group operated by Russia’s military intelligence service, with the goal of neutralizing its attacks on Ukraine.\n“We have since re-directed these domains to a sinkhole controlled by Microsoft, enabling us to mitigate Strontium’s current use of these domains and enable victim notifications,“ Tom Burt, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of customer security and trust, said.\nAPT28, also known by the names Sofacy, Sednit, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Iron Twilight, and Strontium, is a cyber espionage group and an advanced persistent threat that’s known to be active since 2009, striking media, governments, military, and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that often have a security focus.\n\nThe tech giant noted that the sinkholed infrastructure was used by the threat actor to target Ukrainian institutions as well as governments and think tanks in the U.S. and the European Union so as to maintain long term persistent access and exfiltrate sensitive information.\nMeta takes action against Ghostwriter and Phosphorus\nThe disclosure from Microsoft comes as Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, revealed that it took action against covert adversarial networks originating from Azerbaijan and Iran on its platform, by taking down the accounts and blocking their domains from being shared.\nThe Azerbaijanian operation is believed to have singled out democracy activists, opposition groups, and journalists from the country and government critics abroad for carrying out credential phishing and espionage activities.\nAnother involved UNC788 (aka Charming Kitten, TA453, or Phosphorus), a government-linked hacking crew that has a history of conducting surveillance operations in support of Iranian strategic priorities.\n“This group used a combination of low-sophistication fake accounts and more elaborate fictitious personas, which they likely used to build trust with potential targets and trick them into clicking on phishing links or downloading malicious applications,“ Meta outlined in its first quarterly Adversarial Threat Report.\nThe malicious Android applications, dubbed HilalRAT, impersonated seemingly harmless Quran apps to extract sensitive information, such as contacts list, text messages, files, location information, as well as activate camera and microphone.\nMeta also said it blocked the malicious activities associated with an unreported Iranian hacking group that leveraged tactics similar to that of Tortoiseshell to target or spoof companies in the energy, IT, maritime logistics, semiconductor, and telecom industries.\n\nThis campaign featured an elaborate set of bogus profiles on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter, with the actors posing as recruiters of real and front companies to trick users into clicking on phishing links to deliver information stealing malware that were disguised as VPN, calculator, audiobook, and messaging apps.\n“They developed malware on the VMWare ThinApp virtualization platform, which allowed them to run it on many different systems and hold malicious payload back until the last minute, making malware detection more challenging,“ Meta explained.\nLastly, also disrupted by Meta were takeover attempts made by the Belarus-aligned Ghostwriter group to break into the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukrainian military personnel.\nThe attacks, which were successful in a “handful of cases,“ abused the access to victims’ social media accounts and posted disinformation “calling on the Army to surrender as if these posts were coming from the legitimate account owners.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A number of rogue Android apps that have been cumulatively installed from the official Google Play Store more than 50,000 times are being used to target banks and other financial entities.\nThe rental banking trojan, dubbed Octo, is said to be a rebrand of another Android malware called ExobotCompact, which, in turn, is a “lite“ replacement for its Exobot predecessor, Dutch mobile security firm ThreatFabric said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nExobot is also likely said to have paved the way for a separate descendant called Coper, that was initially discovered targeting Colombian users around July 2021, with newer infections targeting Android users in different European Countries.\n“Coper malware apps are modular in design and include a multi-stage infection method and many defensive tactics to survive removal attempts,“ Cybersecurity company Cyble noted in an analysis of the malware last month.\n\nLike other Android banking trojans, the rogue apps are nothing more than droppers, whose primary function is to deploy the malicious payload embedded within them. The list of Octo and Coper droppers used by multiple threat actors is below -\nPocket Screencaster (com.moh.screen)Fast Cleaner 2021 (vizeeva.fast.cleaner)Play Store (com.restthe71)Postbank Security (com.carbuildz)Pocket Screencaster (com.cutthousandjs)BAWAG PSK Security (com.frontwonder2), andPlay Store app install (com.theseeye5)\nThese apps, which pose as Play Store app installer, screen recording, and financial apps, are “powered by inventive distribution schemes,“ distributing them through the Google Play store and via fraudulent landing pages that purportedly alert users to download a browser update.\n\nThe droppers, once installed, act as a conduit to launch the trojans, but not before requesting users to enable the Accessibility Services that allow it a wide breadth of capabilities to exfiltrate sensitive information from the compromised phones.\nOcto, the revised version of ExobotCompact, is also equipped to perform on-device fraud by gaining remote control over the devices by taking advantage of the accessibility permissions as well as Android’s MediaProjection API to capture screen contents in real-time.\nThe ultimate goal, ThreatFabric said, is to trigger the “automatic initiation of fraudulent transactions and its authorization without manual efforts from the operator, thus allowing fraud on a significantly larger scale.“\nOther notable features of Octo include logging keystrokes, carrying out overlay attacks on banking apps to capture credentials, harvesting contact information, and persistence measures to prevent uninstallation and evade antivirus engines.\n\n“Rebranding to Octo erases previous ties to the Exobot source code leak, inviting multiple threat actors looking for opportunity to rent an allegedly new and original trojan,“ ThreatFabric noted.\n“Its capabilities put at risk not only explicitly targeted applications that are targeted by overlay attack, but any application installed on the infected device as ExobotCompact/Octo is able to read content of any app displayed on the screen and provide the actor with sufficient information to remotely interact with it and perform on-device fraud (ODF).“\nThe findings come close on the heels of the discovery of a distinct Android bankbot named GodFather — sharing overlaps with the Cereberus and Medusa banking trojans — that has been observed targeting banking users in Europe under the guise of the default Settings app to transfer funds and steal SMS messages, among others.\nOn top of that, a new analysis published by AppCensus found 11 apps with more than 46 million installations that were implanted with a third-party SDK named Coelib that made it possible to capture clipboard content, GPS data, email addresses, phone numbers, and even the user’s modem router MAC address and network SSID.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'First Malware Targeting AWS Lambda Serverless Platform Discovered',
'text': 'A first-of-its-kind malware targeting Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) Lambda serverless computing platform has been discovered in the wild.\nDubbed “Denonia“ after the name of the domain it communicates with, “the malware uses newer address resolution techniques for command and control traffic to evade typical detection measures and virtual network access controls,“ Cado Labs researcher Matt Muir said.\n\nThe artifact analyzed by the cybersecurity company was uploaded to the VirusTotal database on February 25, 2022, sporting the name “python“ and packaged as a 64-bit ELF executable.\nHowever, the filename is a misnomer, as Denonia is programmed in Go and harbors a customized variant of the XMRig cryptocurrency mining software. That said, the mode of initial access is unknown, although it’s suspected it may have involved the compromise of AWS Access and Secret Keys.\n\nAnother notable feature of the malware is its use of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for communicating with its command-and-control server (“gw.denonia[.]xyz“) by concealing the traffic within encrypted DNS queries.\nIn a statement shared with The Hacker News, Amazon stressed that “Lambda is secure by default, and AWS continues to operate as designed,“ and that users violating its acceptable use policy (AUP) will be prohibited from using its services.\n\nWhile Denonia has been clearly designed to target AWS Lambda since it checks for Lambda environment variables prior to its execution, Cado Labs also found that it can be run outside of it in a standard Linux server environment.\n“The software described by the researcher does not exploit any weakness in Lambda or any other AWS service,“ the company said. “Since the software relies entirely on fraudulently obtained account credentials, it is a distortion of facts to even refer to it as malware because it lacks the ability to gain unauthorized access to any system by itself.“\nHowever, “python“ isn’t the only sample of Denonia unearthed so far, what with Cado Labs finding a second sample (named “bc50541af8fe6239f0faa7c57a44d119.virus“) that was uploaded to VirusTotal on January 3, 2022.\n“Although this first sample is fairly innocuous in that it only runs crypto-mining software, it demonstrates how attackers are using advanced cloud-specific knowledge to exploit complex cloud infrastructure, and is indicative of potential future, more nefarious attacks,“ Muir said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hamas-linked Hackers Targeting High-Ranking Israelis Using ’Catfish’ Lures',
'text': 'A threat actor with affiliations to the cyber warfare division of Hamas has been linked to an “elaborate campaign“ targeting high-profile Israeli individuals employed in sensitive defense, law enforcement, and emergency services organizations.\n“The campaign operators use sophisticated social engineering techniques, ultimately aimed to deliver previously undocumented backdoors for Windows and Android devices,“ cybersecurity company Cybereason said in a Wednesday report.\n“The goal behind the attack was to extract sensitive information from the victims’ devices for espionage purposes.“\nThe monthslong intrusions, codenamed “Operation Bearded Barbie,“ have been attributed to an Arabic-speaking and politically-motivated group called Arid Viper, which operates out of the Middle East and is also known by the monikers APT-C-23 and Desert Falcon.\n\nMost recently, the threat actor was held responsible for attacks aimed at Palestinian activists and entities starting around October 2021 using politically-themed phishing emails and decoy documents.\nThe latest infiltrations are notable for their specific focus on plundering information from computers and mobile devices belonging to Israeli individuals by luring them into downloading trojanized messaging apps, granting the actors unfettered access.\nThe social engineering attacks involved the use of fake personas on Facebook, relying on the tactic of catfishing to set up fictitious profiles of attractive young women to gain the trust of the targeted individuals and befriend them on the platform.\n“After gaining the victim’s trust, the operator of the fake account suggests migrating the conversation from Facebook over to WhatsApp,“ the researchers elaborated. “By doing so, the operator quickly obtains the target’s mobile number.“\n\nOnce the chat shifts from Facebook to WhatsApp, the attackers suggest the victims that they install a secure messaging app for Android (dubbed “VolatileVenom“) as well as open a RAR archive file containing explicit sexual content that leads to the deployment of a malware downloader called Barb(ie).\nOther hallmarks of the campaign have included the group leveraging an upgraded arsenal of malware tools, including the BarbWire Backdoor, which is installed by the downloader module.\nThe malware serves as a tool to completely compromise the victim machine, allowing it to establish persistence, harvest stored information, record audio, capture screenshots, and download additional payloads, all of which is transmitted back to a remote server.\n\nVolatileVenom, on the other hand, is Android spyware that’s known to spoof legitimate messaging apps and masquerade as system updates and which has been put to use in different campaigns by Arid Viper since at least 2017.\nOne such example of a rogue Android app is called “Wink Chat,“ where victims attempting to sign up to use the application are presented an error message that “it will be uninstalled,“ only for it to stealthily run in the background and extract a wide variety of data from the mobile devices.\n“The attackers use a completely new infrastructure that is distinct from the known infrastructure used to target Palestinians and other Arabic-speakers,“ the researchers said.\n“This campaign shows a considerable step-up in APT-C-23 capabilities, with upgraded stealth, more sophisticated malware, and perfection of their social engineering techniques which involve offensive HUMINT capabilities using a very active and well-groomed network of fake Facebook accounts that have been proven quite effective for the group.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Into the Breach: Breaking Down 3 SaaS App Cyber Attacks in 2022',
'text': 'During the last week of March, three major tech companies - Microsoft, Okta, and HubSpot - reported significant data breaches. DEV-0537, also known as LAPSUS$, performed the first two. This highly sophisticated group utilizes state-of-the-art attack vectors to great success. Meanwhile, the group behind the HubSpot breach was not disclosed. This blog will review the three breaches based on publicly disclosed information and suggest best practices to minimize the risk of such attacks succeeding against your organization. \nHubSpot - Employee Access\nOn March 21, 2022, HubSpot reported the breach which happened on March 18. Malicious actors compromised a HubSpot employee account that the employee used for customer support. This allowed malicious actors the ability to access and export contact data using the employee’s access to several HubSpot accounts. \nWith little information regarding this breach, defending against an attack is challenging, but a key configuration within HubSpot can help. This is the “HubSpot Employee Access“ control (shown in the figure below) in HubSpot’s account setting. Customers should disable this setting at all times, unless they require specific assistance, and then immediately turn it off after completing the service call. \n\nA similar setting appears in other SaaS applications and should be disabled there as well. Employee access is typically recorded in Audit Logs, which should be reviewed regularly.\nLearn how an SSPM can help protect your organization from SaaS misconfigurations\nOkta - Lack of Device Security for Privileged User\nOkta subcontracts some of its customer support to the Sitel Group. On January 21, an Okta security team member received an alert that a new MFA factor was added to a Sitel Group employee account from a new location.\nAn investigation revealed that a Sitel support engineer’s computer was compromised using a remote desktop protocol. This known vulnerability is normally disabled except when specifically needed — which helped Okta investigators narrow the timeframe for the attack to a five-day window between Jan. 16-21, 2022.\nDue to the limited access support engineers have to their system, the impact on Okta customers was minimal. Support engineers don’t have access to create or delete users or download customer databases. Their access to customer data is quite limited as well.\nOn March 22, DEV-0537, which is more commonly known as LAPSUS$, shared screenshots online. In response, Okta released a statement saying, “there are no corrective actions our customers need to take.“ The following day the company shared details of its investigation, which included a detailed response timeline.\nWhile this breach was limited in the damage it caused, it offers three important security lessons.\nSecurity from Device to SaaS – securing a SaaS environment isn’t enough when it comes to protecting against a breach. Securing the devices used by highly privileged users is of paramount importance. Organizations should review their roster of high-privilege users and ensure that their devices are secure. This can limit the damage of a breach via the attack vector that faced Okta.MFA – It was the addition of MFA that allowed Okta security to discover the breach. SSO does not go far enough, and organizations that take SaaS security seriously must also include MFA security measures.Event monitoring – The Okta breach was discovered when security personnel saw an unexpected change in the event monitoring log. Reviewing events such as changes to MFA, password reset, suspicious logins, and more, are critical for SaaS security and should be performed daily.\nSee Cloudflare’s investigation of the January 2022 Okta compromise for a good example of a response to such a breach. \nFind out how Adaptive Shield provides endpoint posture management and SaaS configuration control \nMicrosoft - MFA for all privileged users\nOn March 22, Microsoft Security shared information relating to an attack it suffered at the hands of DEV-0537. Microsoft had a single account compromised, which resulted in source code being stolen and published.\nMicrosoft assured its users that the LAPSUS$ attack didn’t compromise any of their information, and further stated that there was no risk to any of their products due to the stolen code.\nMicrosoft did not specifically share how the breach was carried out, although it did alert readers that LAPSUS$ actively recruits employees at telecoms, major software developers, call centers, and other industries to share credentials.\nThe company also offered these suggestions for securing platforms against these attacks.\nStrengthen MFA implementation - MFA gaps are a key attack vector. Organizations should require MFA options, limiting SMS and email as much as possible, such as with Authenticator or FIDO tokens.Require healthy and trusted endpoints - Organizations should continuously assess device security. Ensure that the devices accessing SaaS platforms comply with their security policies by enforcing secure device configurations with a low vulnerability risk score.Leverage modern authentication options for VPNs - VPN authentication should leverage modern authentication options such as OAuth or SAML.Strengthen and monitor your cloud security posture - Organizations should, at minimum, set conditional access for users and session risk configurations, require MFA, and block high risk logins.\nFor a full list of Microsoft’s recommendations, see this note.\nFinal thoughts\nSecuring SaaS platforms is a major challenge, and as seen this week, even global enterprises need to stay on top of their security. Malicious actors continue to evolve and improve their attack methods, which forces organizations to be on the lookout and prioritize their SaaS security constantly.\nStrong passwords and SSO solutions are no longer enough by themselves. Companies need advanced security measures, such as strong MFA, IP allow lists, and blocking unnecessary support engineer access. An automated solution like SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) can help security teams stay on top of these issues. \nThe importance of device security in SaaS is another takeaway from these attacks. Even a fully secured SaaS platform can be compromised when a privileged user accesses a SaaS app from a compromised device. Leverage a security solution that combines device security posture with SaaS security posture for full, end-to-end protection.\nThe challenge of securing SaaS solutions is complex and beyond burdensome to complete manually. SSPM solutions, like Adaptive Shield, can provide automated SaaS security posture management, with configuration control, endpoint posture management, and 3rd party application control.\nNote — This article is written and contributed by Hananel Livneh, Senior Product Analyst at Adaptive Shield.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'SharkBot Banking Trojan Resurfaces On Google Play Store Hidden Behind 7 New Apps',
'text': 'As many as seven malicious Android apps discovered on the Google Play Store masqueraded as antivirus solutions to deploy a banking trojan called SharkBot.\n“SharkBot steals credentials and banking information,“ Check Point researchers Alex Shamshur and Raman Ladutska said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “This malware implements a geofencing feature and evasion techniques, which makes it stand out from the rest of malwares.“\n\nParticularly, the malware is designed to ignore users from China, India, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The rogue apps are said to have been installed more than 15,000 times prior to their removal, with most of the victims located in Italy and the U.K.\nThe report complements previous findings from NCC Group, which found the bankbot posing as antivirus apps to carry out unauthorized transactions via Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS).\n\nSharkBot takes advantage of Android’s Accessibility Services permissions to present fake overlay windows on top of legitimate banking apps. Thus when unsuspecting users enter their usernames and passwords in the windows that mimic benign credential input forms, the captured data is sent to a malicious server.\n\nOne new notable feature of SharkBot is its ability to auto reply to notifications from Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp to distribute a phishing link to the antivirus app, thus propagating the malware in a worm-like fashion. A similar feature was incorporated in FluBot earlier this February.\n“What’s also noteworthy here is that the threat actors push messages to victims containing malicious links, which leads to widespread adoption,“ Alexander Chailytko, cyber security, research and innovation manager at Check Point Software, said. \n“All in all, the use of push-messages by the threat actors requesting an answer from users is an unusual spreading technique.“\nThe latest findings come as Google took steps to banish 11 apps from the Play Store on March 25 after they were caught incorporating an invasive SDK to discreetly harvest user data, including precise location information, email and phone numbers, nearby devices, and passwords.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Uncover How Colibri Malware Stays Persistent on Hacked Systems',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a “simple but efficient“ persistence mechanism adopted by a relatively nascent malware loader called Colibri, which has been observed deploying a Windows information stealer known as Vidar as part of a new campaign.\n“The attack starts with a malicious Word document deploying a Colibri bot that then delivers the Vidar Stealer,“ Malwarebytes Labs said in an analysis. “The document contacts a remote server at (securetunnel[.]co) to load a remote template named ’trkal0.dot’ that contacts a malicious macro,“ the researchers added.\nFirst documented by FR3D.HK and Indian cybersecurity company CloudSEK earlier this year, Colibri is a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform that’s engineered to drop additional payloads onto compromised systems. Early signs of the loader appeared on Russian underground forums in August 2021.\n“This loader has multiple techniques that help avoid detection,“ CloudSEK researcher Marah Aboud noted last month. “This includes omitting the IAT (Import Address Table) along with the encrypted strings to make the analysis more difficult.“\n\nThe campaign attack chain observed by Malwarebytes takes advantage of a technique called remote template injection to download the Colibri loader (“setup.exe“) by means of a weaponized Microsoft Word document.\nThe loader then makes use of a previously undocumented persistence method to survive machine reboots, but not before dropping its own copy to the location “%APPDATA%\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps“ and naming it “Get-Variable.exe.“\n\nIt achieves this by creating a scheduled task on systems running Windows 10 and above, with the loader executing a command to launch PowerShell with a hidden window (i.e., -WindowStyle Hidden) to conceal the malicious activity from being detected.\n“It so happens that Get-Variable is a valid PowerShell cmdlet (a cmdlet is a lightweight command used in the Windows PowerShell environment) which is used to retrieve the value of a variable in the current console,“ the researchers explained.\n\nBut given the fact that PowerShell is executed by default in the WindowsApps path, the command issued during the scheduled task creation results in the execution of the malicious binary in the place of its legitimate counterpart.\nThis effectively means that “an adversary can easily achieve persistence [by] combining a scheduled task and any payload (as long as it is called Get-Variable.exe and placed in the proper location),“ the researchers said.\nThe latest findings come as cybersecurity company Trustwave last month detailed an email-based phishing campaign that leverages Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files to distribute the Vidar malware in an effort to fly under the radar.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'FBI Shut Down Russia-linked “Cyclops Blink“ Botnet That Infected Thousands of Devices',
'text': 'The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced that it neutralized Cyclops Blink, a modular botnet controlled by a threat actor known as Sandworm, which has been attributed to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU).\n“The operation copied and removed malware from vulnerable internet-connected firewall devices that Sandworm used for command-and-control (C2) of the underlying botnet,“ the DoJ said in a statement Wednesday.\nIn addition to disrupting its C2 infrastructure, the operation also closed the external management ports that the threat actor used to establish connections with the firewall appliances, effectively severing contact and preventing the hacking group from using the infected devices to commandeer the botnet.\n\nThe March 22 court-authorized disruption of Cyclops Blink comes a little over a month after intelligence agencies in the U.K. and the U.S. described the botnet as a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware that was exposed and sinkholed in May 2018.\nCyclops Blink, which is believed to have emerged as early as June 2019, primarily targeted WatchGuard firewall appliances and ASUS routers, with the Sandworm group leveraging a previously identified security vulnerability in WatchGuard’s Firebox firmware as an initial access vector.\nA follow-up analysis by cybersecurity firm Trend Micro last month suggested the possibility that the botnet is an attempt to “build an infrastructure for further attacks on high-value targets.“\n\n“These network devices are often located on the perimeter of a victim’s computer network, thereby providing Sandworm with the potential ability to conduct malicious activities against all computers within those networks,“ the DoJ added.\nDetails of the security flaw were never made public beyond the fact that the company addressed the issue as part of software updates issued in May 2021, with WatchGuard noting to the contrary that the vulnerabilities were internally detected and that they were not “actively found in the wild.“\nThe company has since revised its Cyclops Blink FAQs to spell out that the vulnerability in question is CVE-2022-23176 (CVSS score: 8.8), which could “allow an unprivileged user with access to Firebox management to authenticate to the system as an administrator“ and gain unauthorized remote access.\nASUS, for its part, has released firmware patches as of April 1, 2022, to block the threat, recommending users to update to the latest version.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Cyber Security WEBINAR — How to Ace Your InfoSec Board Deck',
'text': 'Communication is a vital skill for any leader at an organization, regardless of seniority. For security leaders, this goes double. Communicating clearly works on multiple levels. On the one hand, security leaders and CISOs must be able to communicate strategies clearly – instructions, incident response plans, and security policies. On the other, they must be able to communicate the importance of security and the value of having robust defenses to the C-level. \nFor CISOs and other security leaders, this latter skill is crucial but often overlooked or not prioritized. A new webinar: “How to ace your Infosec board deck,“ looks to shed light on both the importance of being able to communicate clearly with management, and key strategies to do so effectively. The webinar will feature a conversation with vCISO and Cybersecurity Consultant Dr. Eric Cole, as well as Norwest Venture Partners General Partner Dave Zilberman. \nMore so than just talking about the dollar value of a security policy, however, security leaders need to show the importance of processes, tasks, decisions, and how threats and other security risks impact the math. \nFrom tactics to strategy\nOne of the biggest differences in communicating to a security team or organization and communicating with management is the scale on which decisions are judged. Most security leaders are focused on the tactical world – the day-to-day perspective required to effectively defend their organizations. This view focuses on the actual decisions made daily, the processes put in place, incident response plans, and the immediate impact of these tasks. \nFor security leaders, this is essential. Threats happen on an immediate basis, and leaders must be able to make decisions that directly deal with them. However, tactics is nothing without a more strategic view. Even the most detail-focused security leader has a plan for how the overall protection of their organization looks. This strategic view abstracts the minute aspects of security while focusing on the big picture. \nBridging the communication gap \nUnlike security leaders who are immersed in their tasks day-to-day, boards and C-levels are more concerned with the strategic side. To communicate effectively the value of their work, CISOs must be able to translate the tasks, policies, decisions, and tactics they deploy into their broader impact on the organization.\nThis includes not only the work being done, but also the risks and threats that could create issues for an organization. Board members might be less concerned with the specifics of how their organization is being protected, and more about the impact these strategies are delivering. \nThe conversation will cover:\nHow InfoSec Leaders can quickly move communications from the tactical to the strategic viewpoint. One of a security leader’s crucial skills is the ability to convey complex cybersecurity tactics in a broader sense and place them in the context of their organization’s successes. How to convert complex security realities into easily digestible and actionable insights. The best presentations don’t focus on nitty gritty. Instead, they offer interpretations, insights, and valuable data about what they mean and how they affect an organization. How to leverage security knowledge to align cybersecurity priorities with business and commercial goals. It often seems like security and business success are diametric opposites, but that’s not quite true. A good security deck can thread the needle to align cybersecurity goals and business strategies in a way that enhances both. How can security leaders provide a real, pragmatic answer to the question: “how secure are we?“ At the end of the day, the board really cares about how secure an organization is, and less about how they get there. This means that security leaders must look at their efforts and provide a transparent and frank accounting of the risks and how well prepared they are to face them. \nYou can register for the webinar here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Threat actors have been distributing malicious applications under the guise of seemingly harmless shopping apps to target customers of eight Malaysian banks since at least November 2021.\nThe attacks involved setting up fraudulent but legitimate-looking websites to trick users into downloading the apps, Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe copycat websites impersonated cleaning services such as Maid4u, Grabmaid, Maria’s Cleaning, Maid4u, YourMaid, Maideasy and MaidACall and a pet store named PetsMore, all of which are aimed at users in Malaysia.\n\n“The threat actors use these fake e-shop applications to phish for banking credentials,“ ESET said. “The apps also forward all SMS messages received by the victim to the malware operators in case they contain 2FA codes sent by the bank.“\n\nThe targeted banks include Maybank, Affin Bank, Public Bank Berhad, CIMB bank, BSN, RHB, Bank Islam Malaysia, and Hong Leong Bank.\nThe websites, distributed through Facebook ads, urge visitors to download what the attackers claim to be are Android apps available on the Google Play Store, but in reality, redirect them to rogue servers under their control.\n\nIt’s worth noting here that the attack hinges on the prerequisite that the potential victims enable the non-default “Install unknown apps“ option on their devices for it to succeed. What’s more, five of the abused services don’t even have an app on Google Play.\nOnce launched, the apps prompt the users to sign in to their accounts, allowing them to place fake orders, following which options are presented to complete the checkout process by including a fund transfer from their bank accounts.\n\n“After picking the direct transfer option, victims are presented [with] a fake FPX payment page and asked to choose their bank out of the eight Malaysian banks provided, and then enter their credentials,“ ESET malware researcher Lukáš Štefanko said.\nThe ultimate goal of the campaign is to steal the banking credentials entered by the users and exfiltrate it to the attacker-controlled server, while displaying an error message that the entered user ID or password is invalid.\nIn addition, the fake apps are engineered to access and transmit all SMS messages received by the users to the remote server in the event the bank accounts are secured by two-factor authentication.\n“While the campaign targets Malaysia exclusively for now, it might expand to other countries and banks later on,“ Štefanko said. “At this time, the attackers are after banking credentials, but they may also enable the theft of credit card information in the future.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

He also purportedly conspired with other operators of the marketplace by providing the infrastructure backbone that enabled its success in a “competitive darknet market environment.“\n“In 2021, Hydra accounted for an estimated 80% of all darknet market-related cryptocurrency transactions, and since 2015, the marketplace has received approximately $5.2 billion in cryptocurrency,“ the DoJ said.\n\nBesides allowing vendors to openly advertise a variety of deadly drugs for sale through a five-star rating system, Hydra is also said to have functioned as a distribution channel for forged passports and drivers’ licenses as well as hacking tools and services that allowed bad actors to gain illegal access to online accounts.\n\nThese transactions on Hydra were conducted in virtual currency and its administrators charged a commission for every transaction conducted on the website. Hydra also provided users with cash-out and mixing services to convert their bitcoins into different forms of digital crypto assets and conceal their tracks.\n“The dismantling of the Hydra Market, the dark web’s largest supplier of illicit goods and services, sends a message to these electronic criminal kingpins that think they can operate with impunity,“ said Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami.\n“HSI will continue to work with our U.S. and international law enforcement partners to target these transnational criminal organizations who attempt to manipulate the anonymity of the dark web to push their poison all over the world,“ Salisbury added.\nThe takedown has predictably “prompted heated discussions“ on the dark web, as threat actors relying on the services offered by Hydra speculate about the future of the marketplace and point out the possibility that authorities or other malicious parties could “set up fake versions of Hydra in order to track down former users.“\nHowever, the administrators of Hydra have not acknowledged the closure and are attempting to paint a different picture, cybersecurity company Flashpoint said, with the operators reportedly claiming that “the market is undergoing ’technical works.’“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'FIN7 Hackers Leveraging Password Reuse and Software Supply Chain Attacks',
'text': 'The notorious cybercrime group known as FIN7 has diversified its initial access vectors to incorporate software supply chain compromise and the use of stolen credentials, new research has revealed.\n“Data theft extortion or ransomware deployment following FIN7-attributed activity at multiple organizations, as well as technical overlaps, suggests that FIN7 actors have been associated with various ransomware operations over time,“ incident response firm Mandiant said in a Monday analysis.\nThe cybercriminal group, since its emergence in the mid-2010s, has gained notoriety for large-scale malware campaigns targeting the point-of-sale (POS) systems aimed at restaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries with credit card-stealing malware.\n\nFIN7’s shift in monetization strategy towards ransomware follows an October 2021 report from Recorded Future’s Gemini Advisory unit, which found the adversary setting up a fake front company named Bastion Secure to recruit unwitting penetration testers in a lead up to a ransomware attack.\nThen earlier this January, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a Flash Alert warning organizations that the financially motivated gang was sending malicious USB drives (aka BadUSB) to U.S. business targets in the transportation, insurance, and defense industries to infect systems with malware, including ransomware.\n\nRecent intrusions staged by the actor since 2020 have involved the deployment of a vast PowerShell backdoor framework called POWERPLANT, continuing the group’s penchant for using PowerShell-based malware for its offensive operations.\n“There is no doubt about it, PowerShell is FIN7’s love language,“ Mandiant researchers said.\nIn one of the attacks, FIN7 was observed compromising a website that sells digital products in order to tweak multiple download links to make them point to an Amazon S3 bucket hosting trojanized versions that contained Atera Agent, a legitimate remote management tool, which then delivered POWERPLANT to the victim’s system.\nThe supply chain attack also marks the group’s evolving tradecraft for initial access and the deployment of first-stage malware payloads, which have typically centered around phishing schemes.\n\nOther tools used by the group to facilitate its infiltrations include EASYLOOK, a reconnaissance utility; BOATLAUNCH, a helper module designed to bypass Windows AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI); and BIRDWATCH, a .NET-based downloader employed to fetch and execute next-stage binaries received over HTTP.\n“Despite indictments of members of FIN7 in 2018 and a related sentencing in 2021 announced by the U.S. Department of Justice, at least some members of FIN7 have remained active and continue to evolve their criminal operations over time,“ Mandiant researchers said.\n“Throughout their evolution, FIN7 has increased the speed of their operational tempo, the scope of their targeting, and even possibly their relationships with other ransomware operations in the cybercriminal underground.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?
